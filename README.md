Cymer-Scan

Our mission:
 - Detect the exact snapshot of an encrypted file and return a list of the encrypted files.
 
The algorithm uses several different tests (entropy, ASCII check, bytes check, etc), to sum it up and check whether it's above the threshold.
After that, determine whether the file is encrypted or not.
