forth at daybreak, by Lothario, who, not knowing who he was, at first took
him for a spectre; but, as soon as he saw him hasten away, muffling his
face with his cloak and concealing himself carefully and cautiously, he
rejected this foolish idea, and adopted another, which would have been the
ruin of all had not Camilla found a remedy. It did not occur to Lothario
that this man he had seen issuing at such an untimely hour from Anselmo’s
house could have entered it on Leonela’s account, nor did he even remember
there was such a person as Leonela; all he thought was that as Camilla had
been light and yielding with him, so she had been with another; for this
further penalty the erring woman’s sin brings with it, that her honour is
distrusted even by him to whose overtures and persuasions she has yielded;
and he believes her to have surrendered more easily to others, and gives
implicit credence to every suspicion that comes into his mind. All
Lothario’s good sense seems to have failed him at this juncture; all his
prudent maxims escaped his memory; for without once reflecting rationally,
and without more ado, in his impatience and in the blindness of the
jealous rage that gnawed his heart, and dying to revenge himself upon
Camilla, who had done him no wrong, before Anselmo had risen he hastened
to him and said to him, “Know, Anselmo, that for several days past I have
been struggling with myself, striving to withhold from thee what it is no
longer possible or right that I should conceal from thee. Know that
Camilla’s fortress has surrendered and is ready to submit to my will; and
if I have been slow to reveal this fact to thee, it was in order to see if
it were some light caprice of hers, or if she sought to try me and
ascertain if the love I began to make to her with thy permission was made
with a serious intention. I thought, too, that she, if she were what she
ought to be, and what we both believed her, would have ere this given thee
information of my addresses; but seeing that she delays, I believe the
truth of the promise she has given me that the next time thou art absent
from the house she will grant me an interview in the closet where thy
jewels are kept (and it was true that Camilla used to meet him there); but
I do not wish thee to rush precipitately to take vengeance, for the sin is
as yet only committed in intention, and Camilla’s may change perhaps
between this and the appointed time, and repentance spring up in its
place. As hitherto thou hast always followed my advice wholly or in part,
follow and observe this that I will give thee now, so that, without
mistake, and with mature deliberation, thou mayest satisfy thyself as to
what may seem the best course; pretend to absent thyself for two or three
days as thou hast been wont to do on other occasions, and contrive to hide
thyself in the closet; for the tapestries and other things there afford
great facilities for thy concealment, and then thou wilt see with thine
own eyes and I with mine what Camilla’s purpose may be. And if it be a
guilty one, which may be feared rather than expected, with silence,
prudence, and discretion thou canst thyself become the instrument of
punishment for the wrong done thee.”
</p>
<p>
Anselmo was amazed, overwhelmed, and astounded at the words of Lothario,
which came upon him at a time when he least expected to hear them, for he
now looked upon Camilla as having triumphed over the pretended attacks of
Lothario, and was beginning to enjoy the glory of her victory. He remained
silent for a considerable time, looking on the ground with fixed gaze, and
at length said, “Thou hast behaved, Lothario, as I expected of thy
friendship: I will follow thy advice in everything; do as thou wilt, and
keep this secret as thou seest it should be kept in circumstances so
unlooked for.”
</p>
<p>
Lothario gave him his word, but after leaving him he repented altogether
of what he had said to him, perceiving how foolishly he had acted, as he
might have revenged himself upon Camilla in some less cruel and degrading
way. He cursed his want of sense, condemned his hasty resolution, and knew
not what course to take to undo the mischief or find some ready escape
from it. At last he decided upon revealing all to Camilla, and, as there
was no want of opportunity for doing so, he found her alone the same day;
but she, as soon as she had the chance of speaking to him, said, “Lothario
my friend, I must tell thee I have a sorrow in my heart which fills it so
that it seems ready to burst; and it will be a wonder if it does not; for
the audacity of Leonela has now reached such a pitch that every night she
conceals a gallant of hers in this house and remains with him till
morning, at the expense of my reputation; inasmuch as it is open to anyone
to question it who may see him quitting my house at such unseasonable
hours; but what distresses me is that I cannot punish or chide her, for
her privity to our intrigue bridles my mouth and keeps me silent about
hers, while I am dreading that some catastrophe will come of it.”
</p>
<p>
As Camilla said this Lothario at first imagined it was some device to
delude him into the idea that the man he had seen going out was Leonela’s
lover and not hers; but when he saw how she wept and suffered, and begged
him to help her, he became convinced of the truth, and the conviction
completed his confusion and remorse; however, he told Camilla not to
distress herself, as he would take measures to put a stop to the insolence
of Leonela. At the same time he told her what, driven by the fierce rage
of jealousy, he had said to Anselmo, and how he had arranged to hide
himself in the closet that he might there see plainly how little she
preserved her fidelity to him; and he entreated her pardon for this
madness, and her advice as to how to repair it, and escape safely from the
intricate labyrinth in which his imprudence had involved him. Camilla was
struck with alarm at hearing what Lothario said, and with much anger, and
great good sense, she reproved him and rebuked his base design and the
foolish and mischievous resolution he had made; but as woman has by nature
a nimbler wit than man for good and for evil, though it is apt to fail
when she sets herself deliberately to reason, Camilla on the spur of the
moment thought of a way to remedy what was to all appearance irremediable,
and told Lothario to contrive that the next day Anselmo should conceal
himself in the place he mentioned, for she hoped from his concealment to
obtain the means of their enjoying themselves for the future without any
apprehension; and without revealing her purpose to him entirely she
charged him to be careful, as soon as Anselmo was concealed, to come to
her when Leonela should call him, and to all she said to him to answer as
he would have answered had he not known that Anselmo was listening.
Lothario pressed her to explain her intention fully, so that he might with
more certainty and precaution take care to do what he saw to be needful.
</p>
<p>
“I tell you,” said Camilla, “there is nothing to take care of except to
answer me what I shall ask you;” for she did not wish to explain to him
beforehand what she meant to do, fearing lest he should be unwilling to
follow out an idea which seemed to her such a good one, and should try or
devise some other less practicable plan.
</p>
<p>
Lothario then retired, and the next day Anselmo, under pretence of going
to his friend’s country house, took his departure, and then returned to
conceal himself, which he was able to do easily, as Camilla and Leonela
took care to give him the opportunity; and so he placed himself in hiding
in the state of agitation that it may be imagined he would feel who
expected to see the vitals of his honour laid bare before his eyes, and
found himself on the point of losing the supreme blessing he thought he
possessed in his beloved Camilla. Having made sure of Anselmo’s being in
his hiding-place, Camilla and Leonela entered the closet, and the instant
she set foot within it Camilla said, with a deep sigh, “Ah! dear Leonela,
would it not be better, before I do what I am unwilling you should know
lest you should seek to prevent it, that you should take Anselmo’s dagger
that I have asked of you and with it pierce this vile heart of mine? But
no; there is no reason why I should suffer the punishment of another’s
fault. I will first know what it is that the bold licentious eyes of
Lothario have seen in me that could have encouraged him to reveal to me a
design so base as that which he has disclosed regardless of his friend and
of my honour. Go to the window, Leonela, and call him, for no doubt he is
in the street waiting to carry out his vile project; but mine, cruel it
may be, but honourable, shall be carried out first.”
</p>
<p>
“Ah, señora,” said the crafty Leonela, who knew her part, “what is it you
want to do with this dagger? Can it be that you mean to take your own
life, or Lothario’s? for whichever you mean to do, it will lead to the
loss of your reputation and good name. It is better to dissemble your
wrong and not give this wicked man the chance of entering the house now
and finding us alone; consider, señora, we are weak women and he is a man,
and determined, and as he comes with such a base purpose, blind and urged
by passion, perhaps before you can put yours into execution he may do what
will be worse for you than taking your life. Ill betide my master,
Anselmo, for giving such authority in his house to this shameless fellow!
And supposing you kill him, señora, as I suspect you mean to do, what
shall we do with him when he is dead?”
</p>
<p>
“What, my friend?” replied Camilla, “we shall leave him for Anselmo to
bury him; for in reason it will be to him a light labour to hide his own
infamy under ground. Summon him, make haste, for all the time I delay in
taking vengeance for my wrong seems to me an offence against the loyalty I
owe my husband.”
</p>
<p>
Anselmo was listening to all this, and every word that Camilla uttered
made him change his mind; but when he heard that it was resolved to kill
Lothario his first impulse was to come out and show himself to avert such
a disaster; but in his anxiety to see the issue of a resolution so bold
and virtuous he restrained himself, intending to come forth in time to
prevent the deed. At this moment Camilla, throwing herself upon a bed that
was close by, swooned away, and Leonela began to weep bitterly,
exclaiming, “Woe is me! that I should be fated to have dying here in my
arms the flower of virtue upon earth, the crown of true wives, the pattern
of chastity!” with more to the same effect, so that anyone who heard her
would have taken her for the most tender-hearted and faithful handmaid in
the world, and her mistress for another persecuted Penelope.
</p>
<p>
Camilla was not long in recovering from her fainting fit and on coming to
herself she said, “Why do you not go, Leonela, to call hither that friend,
the falsest to his friend the sun ever shone upon or night concealed?
Away, run, haste, speed! lest the fire of my wrath burn itself out with
delay, and the righteous vengeance that I hope for melt away in menaces
and maledictions.”
</p>
<p>
“I am just going to call him, señora,” said Leonela; “but you must first
give me that dagger, lest while I am gone you should by means of it give
cause to all who love you to weep all their lives.”
</p>
<p>
“Go in peace, dear Leonela, I will not do so,” said Camilla, “for rash and
foolish as I may be, to your mind, in defending my honour, I am not going
to be so much so as that Lucretia who they say killed herself without
having done anything wrong, and without having first killed him on whom
the guilt of her misfortune lay. I shall die, if I am to die; but it must
be after full vengeance upon him who has brought me here to weep over
audacity that no fault of mine gave birth to.”
</p>
<p>
Leonela required much pressing before she would go to summon Lothario, but
at last she went, and while awaiting her return Camilla continued, as if
speaking to herself, “Good God! would it not have been more prudent to
have repulsed Lothario, as I have done many a time before, than to allow
him, as I am now doing, to think me unchaste and vile, even for the short
time I must wait until I undeceive him? No doubt it would have been
better; but I should not be avenged, nor the honour of my husband
vindicated, should he find so clear and easy an escape from the strait
into which his depravity has led him. Let the traitor pay with his life
for the temerity of his wanton wishes, and let the world know (if haply it
shall ever come to know) that Camilla not only preserved her allegiance to
her husband, but avenged him of the man who dared to wrong him. Still, I
think it might be better to disclose this to Anselmo. But then I have
called his attention to it in the letter I wrote to him in the country,
and, if he did nothing to prevent the mischief I there pointed out to him,
I suppose it was that from pure goodness of heart and trustfulness he
would not and could not believe that any thought against his honour could
harbour in the breast of so stanch a friend; nor indeed did I myself
believe it for many days, nor should I have ever believed it if his
insolence had not gone so far as to make it manifest by open presents,
lavish promises, and ceaseless tears. But why do I argue thus? Does a bold
determination stand in need of arguments? Surely not. Then traitors
avaunt! Vengeance to my aid! Let the false one come, approach, advance,
die, yield up his life, and then befall what may. Pure I came to him whom
Heaven bestowed upon me, pure I shall leave him; and at the worst bathed
in my own chaste blood and in the foul blood of the falsest friend that
friendship ever saw in the world;” and as she uttered these words she
paced the room holding the unsheathed dagger, with such irregular and
disordered steps, and such gestures that one would have supposed her to
have lost her senses, and taken her for some violent desperado instead of
a delicate woman.
</p>
<p>
Anselmo, concealed behind some tapestries where he had hidden himself, beheld
and was amazed at all, and already felt that what he had seen and heard was a
sufficient answer to even greater suspicions; and he would have been now well
pleased if the proof afforded by Lothario’s coming were dispensed with,
as he feared some sudden mishap; but as he was on the point of showing himself
and coming forth to embrace and undeceive his wife he paused as he saw Leonela
returning, leading Lothario. Camilla when she saw him, drawing a long line in
front of her on the floor with the dagger, said to him, “Lothario, pay
attention to what I say to thee: if by any chance thou darest to cross this
line thou seest, or even approach it, the instant I see thee attempt it that
same instant will I pierce my bosom with this dagger that I hold in my hand;
and before thou answerest me a word I desire thee to listen to a few from me,
and afterwards thou shalt reply as may please thee. First, I desire thee to
tell me, Lothario, if thou knowest my husband Anselmo, and in what light thou
regardest him; and secondly I desire to know if thou knowest me too. Answer me
this, without embarrassment or reflecting deeply what thou wilt answer, for
they are no riddles I put to thee.”
</p>
<p>
Lothario was not so dull but that from the first moment when Camilla
directed him to make Anselmo hide himself he understood what she intended
to do, and therefore he fell in with her idea so readily and promptly that
between them they made the imposture look more true than truth; so he
answered her thus: “I did not think, fair Camilla, that thou wert calling
me to ask questions so remote from the object with which I come; but if it
is to defer the promised reward thou art doing so, thou mightst have put
it off still longer, for the longing for happiness gives the more distress
the nearer comes the hope of gaining it; but lest thou shouldst say that I
do not answer thy questions, I say that I know thy husband Anselmo, and
that we have known each other from our earliest years; I will not speak of
what thou too knowest, of our friendship, that I may not compel myself to
testify against the wrong that love, the mighty excuse for greater errors,
makes me inflict upon him. Thee I know and hold in the same estimation as
he does, for were it not so I had not for a lesser prize acted in
opposition to what I owe to my station and the holy laws of true
friendship, now broken and violated by me through that powerful enemy,
love.”
</p>
<p>
“If thou dost confess that,” returned Camilla, “mortal enemy of all that
rightly deserves to be loved, with what face dost thou dare to come before
one whom thou knowest to be the mirror wherein he is reflected on whom
thou shouldst look to see how unworthily thou wrongest him? But, woe is me, I now
comprehend what has made thee give so little heed to what thou owest to
thyself; it must have been some freedom of mine, for I will not call it
immodesty, as it did not proceed from any deliberate intention, but from
some heedlessness such as women are guilty of through inadvertence when
they think they have no occasion for reserve. But tell me, traitor, when
did I by word or sign give a reply to thy prayers that could awaken in
thee a shadow of hope of attaining thy base wishes? When were not thy
professions of love sternly and scornfully rejected and rebuked? When were
thy frequent pledges and still more frequent gifts believed or accepted?
But as I am persuaded that no one can long persevere in the attempt to win
love unsustained by some hope, I am willing to attribute to myself the
blame of thy assurance, for no doubt some thoughtlessness of mine has all
this time fostered thy hopes; and therefore will I punish myself and
inflict upon myself the penalty thy guilt deserves. And that thou mayest
see that being so relentless to myself I cannot possibly be otherwise to
thee, I have summoned thee to be a witness of the sacrifice I mean to
offer to the injured honour of my honoured husband, wronged by thee with
all the assiduity thou wert capable of, and by me too through want of
caution in avoiding every occasion, if I have given any, of encouraging
and sanctioning thy base designs. Once more I say the suspicion in my mind
that some imprudence of mine has engendered these lawless thoughts in
thee, is what causes me most distress and what I desire most to punish
with my own hands, for were any other instrument of punishment employed my
error might become perhaps more widely known; but before I do so, in my
death I mean to inflict death, and take with me one that will fully
satisfy my longing for the revenge I hope for and have; for I shall see,
wheresoever it may be that I go, the penalty awarded by inflexible,
unswerving justice on him who has placed me in a position so desperate.”
</p>
<p>
As she uttered these words, with incredible energy and swiftness she flew
upon Lothario with the naked dagger, so manifestly bent on burying it in
his breast that he was almost uncertain whether these demonstrations were
real or feigned, for he was obliged to have recourse to all his skill and
strength to prevent her from striking him; and with such reality did she
act this strange farce and mystification that, to give it a colour of
truth, she determined to stain it with her own blood; for perceiving, or
pretending, that she could not wound Lothario, she said, “Fate, it seems,
will not grant my just desire complete satisfaction, but it will not be
able to keep me from satisfying it partially at least;” and making an
effort to free the hand with the dagger which Lothario held in his grasp,
she released it, and directing the point to a place where it could not
inflict a deep wound, she plunged it into her left side high up close to
the shoulder, and then allowed herself to fall to the ground as if in a
faint.
</p>
<p>
Leonela and Lothario stood amazed and astounded at the catastrophe, and
seeing Camilla stretched on the ground and bathed in her blood they were
still uncertain as to the true nature of the act. Lothario, terrified and
breathless, ran in haste to pluck out the dagger; but when he saw how
slight the wound was he was relieved of his fears and once more admired
the subtlety, coolness, and ready wit of the fair Camilla; and the better
to support the part he had to play he began to utter profuse and doleful
lamentations over her body as if she were dead, invoking maledictions not
only on himself but also on him who had been the means of placing him in
such a position: and knowing that his friend Anselmo heard him he spoke in
such a way as to make a listener feel much more pity for him than for
Camilla, even though he supposed her dead. Leonela took her up in her arms
and laid her on the bed, entreating Lothario to go in quest of someone to
attend to her wound in secret, and at the same time asking his advice and
opinion as to what they should say to Anselmo about his lady’s wound if he
should chance to return before it was healed. He replied they might say
what they liked, for he was not in a state to give advice that would be of
any use; all he could tell her was to try and stanch the blood, as he was
going where he should never more be seen; and with every appearance of
deep grief and sorrow he left the house; but when he found himself alone,
and where there was nobody to see him, he crossed himself unceasingly,
lost in wonder at the adroitness of Camilla and the consistent acting of
Leonela. He reflected how convinced Anselmo would be that he had a second
Portia for a wife, and he looked forward anxiously to meeting him in order
to rejoice together over falsehood and truth the most craftily veiled that
could be imagined.
</p>
<p>
Leonela, as he told her, stanched her lady’s blood, which was no more than
sufficed to support her deception; and washing the wound with a little
wine she bound it up to the best of her skill, talking all the time she
was tending her in a strain that, even if nothing else had been said
before, would have been enough to assure Anselmo that he had in Camilla a
model of purity. To Leonela’s words Camilla added her own, calling herself
cowardly and wanting in spirit, since she had not enough at the time she
had most need of it to rid herself of the life she so much loathed. She
asked her attendant’s advice as to whether or not she ought to inform her
beloved husband of all that had happened, but the other bade her say
nothing about it, as she would lay upon him the obligation of taking
vengeance on Lothario, which he could not do but at great risk to himself;
and it was the duty of a true wife not to give her husband provocation to
quarrel, but, on the contrary, to remove it as far as possible from him.
</p>
<p>
Camilla replied that she believed she was right and that she would follow
her advice, but at any rate it would be well to consider how she was to
explain the wound to Anselmo, for he could not help seeing it; to which
Leonela answered that she did not know how to tell a lie even in jest.
</p>
<p>
“How then can I know, my dear?” said Camilla, “for I should not dare to
forge or keep up a falsehood if my life depended on it. If we can think of
no escape from this difficulty, it will be better to tell him the plain
truth than that he should find us out in an untrue story.”
</p>
<p>
“Be not uneasy, señora,” said Leonela; “between this and to-morrow I will
think of what we must say to him, and perhaps the wound being where it is
it can be hidden from his sight, and Heaven will be pleased to aid us in a
purpose so good and honourable. Compose yourself, señora, and endeavour to
calm your excitement lest my lord find you agitated; and leave the rest to
my care and God’s, who always supports good intentions.”
</p>
<p>
Anselmo had with the deepest attention listened to and seen played out the
tragedy of the death of his honour, which the performers acted with such
wonderfully effective truth that it seemed as if they had become the
realities of the parts they played. He longed for night and an opportunity
of escaping from the house to go and see his good friend Lothario, and
with him give vent to his joy over the precious pearl he had gained in
having established his wife’s purity. Both mistress and maid took care to
give him time and opportunity to get away, and taking advantage of it he
made his escape, and at once went in quest of Lothario, and it would be
impossible to describe how he embraced him when he found him, and the
things he said to him in the joy of his heart, and the praises he bestowed
upon Camilla; all which Lothario listened to without being able to show
any pleasure, for he could not forget how deceived his friend was, and how
dishonourably he had wronged him; and though Anselmo could see that
Lothario was not glad, still he imagined it was only because he had left
Camilla wounded and had been himself the cause of it; and so among other
things he told him not to be distressed about Camilla’s accident, for, as
they had agreed to hide it from him, the wound was evidently trifling; and
that being so, he had no cause for fear, but should henceforward be of
good cheer and rejoice with him, seeing that by his means and adroitness
he found himself raised to the greatest height of happiness that he could
have ventured to hope for, and desired no better pastime than making
verses in praise of Camilla that would preserve her name for all time to
come. Lothario commended his purpose, and promised on his own part to aid
him in raising a monument so glorious.
</p>
<p>
And so Anselmo was left the most charmingly hoodwinked man there could be
in the world. He himself, persuaded he was conducting the instrument of
his glory, led home by the hand of him who had been the utter destruction of
his good name; whom Camilla received with averted countenance, though with
smiles in her heart. The deception was carried on for some time, until at
the end of a few months Fortune turned her wheel and the guilt which had
been until then so skilfully concealed was published abroad, and Anselmo
paid with his life the penalty of his ill-advised curiosity.

<a id="ch35"></a>CHAPTER XXXV.<br>
WHICH TREATS OF THE HEROIC AND PRODIGIOUS BATTLE DON QUIXOTE HAD WITH
CERTAIN SKINS OF RED WINE, AND BRINGS THE NOVEL OF “THE ILL-ADVISED
CURIOSITY” TO A CLOSE
</h3>
<p>
There remained but little more of the novel to be read, when Sancho Panza
burst forth in wild excitement from the garret where Don Quixote was
lying, shouting, “Run, sirs! quick; and help my master, who is in the
thick of the toughest and stiffest battle I ever laid eyes on. By the
living God he has given the giant, the enemy of my lady the Princess
Micomicona, such a slash that he has sliced his head clean off as if it
were a turnip.”
</p>
<p>
“What are you talking about, brother?” said the curate, pausing as he was
about to read the remainder of the novel. “Are you in your senses, Sancho?
How the devil can it be as you say, when the giant is two thousand leagues
away?”
</p>
<p>
Here they heard a loud noise in the chamber, and Don Quixote shouting out,
“Stand, thief, brigand, villain; now I have got thee, and thy scimitar
shall not avail thee!” And then it seemed as though he were slashing
vigorously at the wall.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t stop to listen,” said Sancho, “but go in and part them or help my
master: though there is no need of that now, for no doubt the giant is
dead by this time and giving account to God of his past wicked life; for I
saw the blood flowing on the ground, and the head cut off and fallen on
one side, and it is as big as a large wine-skin.”
</p>
<p>
“May I die,” said the landlord at this, “if Don Quixote or Don Devil has
not been slashing some of the skins of red wine that stand full at his
bed’s head, and the spilt wine must be what this good fellow takes for
blood;” and so saying he went into the room and the rest after him, and
there they found Don Quixote in the strangest costume in the world. He was
in his shirt, which was not long enough in front to cover his thighs
completely and was six fingers shorter behind; his legs were very long and
lean, covered with hair, and anything but clean; on his head he had a
little greasy red cap that belonged to the host, round his left arm he had
rolled the blanket of the bed, to which Sancho, for reasons best known to
himself, owed a grudge, and in his right hand he held his unsheathed
sword, with which he was slashing about on all sides, uttering
exclamations as if he were actually fighting some giant: and the best of
it was his eyes were not open, for he was fast asleep, and dreaming that
he was doing battle with the giant. For his imagination was so wrought
upon by the adventure he was going to accomplish, that it made him dream
he had already reached the kingdom of Micomicon, and was engaged in combat
with his enemy; and believing he was laying on the giant, he had given so
many sword cuts to the skins that the whole room was full of wine. On
seeing this the landlord was so enraged that he fell on Don Quixote, and
with his clenched fist began to pummel him in such a way, that if Cardenio
and the curate had not dragged him off, he would have brought the war of
the giant to an end. But in spite of all the poor gentleman never woke
until the barber brought a great pot of cold water from the well and flung
it with one dash all over his body, on which Don Quixote woke up, but not
so completely as to understand what was the matter. Dorothea, seeing how
short and slight his attire was, would not go in to witness the battle
between her champion and her opponent. As for Sancho, he went searching
all over the floor for the head of the giant, and not finding it he said,
“I see now that it’s all enchantment in this house; for the last time, on
this very spot where I am now, I got ever so many thumps without knowing
who gave them to me, or being able to see anybody; and now this head is
not to be seen anywhere about, though I saw it cut off with my own eyes
and the blood running from the body as if from a fountain.”
</p>
<p>
“What blood and fountains are you talking about, enemy of God and his
saints?” said the landlord. “Don’t you see, you thief, that the blood and
the fountain are only these skins here that have been stabbed and the red
wine swimming all over the room?—and I wish I saw the soul of him
that stabbed them swimming in hell.”
</p>
<p>
“I know nothing about that,” said Sancho; “all I know is it will be my bad
luck that through not finding this head my county will melt away like salt
in water;”—for Sancho awake was worse than his master asleep, so
much had his master’s promises addled his wits.
</p>
<p>
The landlord was beside himself at the coolness of the squire and the
mischievous doings of the master, and swore it should not be like the last
time when they went without paying; and that their privileges of chivalry
should not hold good this time to let one or other of them off without
paying, even to the cost of the plugs that would have to be put to the
damaged wine-skins. The curate was holding Don Quixote’s hands, who,
fancying he had now ended the adventure and was in the presence of the
Princess Micomicona, knelt before the curate and said, “Exalted and
beauteous lady, your highness may live from this day forth fearless of any
harm this base being could do you; and I too from this day forth am
released from the promise I gave you, since by the help of God on high and
by the favour of her by whom I live and breathe, I have fulfilled it so
successfully.”
</p>
<p>
“Did not I say so?” said Sancho on hearing this. “You see I wasn’t drunk;
there you see my master has already salted the giant; there’s no doubt
about the bulls; my county is all right!”
</p>
<p>
Who could have helped laughing at the absurdities of the pair, master and
man? And laugh they did, all except the landlord, who cursed himself; but
at length the barber, Cardenio, and the curate contrived with no small
trouble to get Don Quixote on the bed, and he fell asleep with every
appearance of excessive weariness. They left him to sleep, and came out to
the gate of the inn to console Sancho Panza on not having found the head
of the giant; but much more work had they to appease the landlord, who was
furious at the sudden death of his wine-skins; and said the landlady half
scolding, half crying, “At an evil moment and in an unlucky hour he came
into my house, this knight-errant—would that I had never set eyes on
him, for dear he has cost me; the last time he went off with the overnight
score against him for supper, bed, straw, and barley, for himself and his
squire and a hack and an ass, saying he was a knight adventurer—God
send unlucky adventures to him and all the adventurers in the world—and
therefore not bound to pay anything, for it was so settled by the
knight-errantry tariff: and then, all because of him, came the other
gentleman and carried off my tail, and gives it back more than two
cuartillos the worse, all stripped of its hair, so that it is no use for
my husband’s purpose; and then, for a finishing touch to all, to burst my
wine-skins and spill my wine! I wish I saw his own blood spilt! But let
him not deceive himself, for, by the bones of my father and the shade of
my mother, they shall pay me down every quarto; or my name is not what it
is, and I am not my father’s daughter.” All this and more to the same
effect the landlady delivered with great irritation, and her good maid
Maritornes backed her up, while the daughter held her peace and smiled
from time to time. The curate smoothed matters by promising to make good
all losses to the best of his power, not only as regarded the wine-skins
but also the wine, and above all the depreciation of the tail which they
set such store by. Dorothea comforted Sancho, telling him that she pledged
herself, as soon as it should appear certain that his master had
decapitated the giant, and she found herself peacefully established in her
kingdom, to bestow upon him the best county there was in it. With this
Sancho consoled himself, and assured the princess she might rely upon it
that he had seen the head of the giant, and more by token it had a beard
that reached to the girdle, and that if it was not to be seen now it was
because everything that happened in that house went by enchantment, as he
himself had proved the last time he had lodged there. Dorothea said she
fully believed it, and that he need not be uneasy, for all would go well
and turn out as he wished. All therefore being appeased, the curate was
anxious to go on with the novel, as he saw there was but little more left
to read. Dorothea and the others begged him to finish it, and he, as he
was willing to please them, and enjoyed reading it himself, continued the
tale in these words:
</p>
<p class="p2">
The result was, that from the confidence Anselmo felt in Camilla’s virtue,
he lived happy and free from anxiety, and Camilla purposely looked coldly
on Lothario, that Anselmo might suppose her feelings towards him to be the
opposite of what they were; and the better to support the position,
Lothario begged to be excused from coming to the house, as the displeasure
with which Camilla regarded his presence was plain to be seen. But the
befooled Anselmo said he would on no account allow such a thing, and so in
a thousand ways he became the author of his own dishonour, while he
believed he was insuring his happiness. Meanwhile the satisfaction with
which Leonela saw herself empowered to carry on her amour reached such a
height that, regardless of everything else, she followed her inclinations
unrestrainedly, feeling confident that her mistress would screen her, and
even show her how to manage it safely. At last one night Anselmo heard
footsteps in Leonela’s room, and on trying to enter to see who it was, he
found that the door was held against him, which made him all the more
determined to open it; and exerting his strength he forced it open, and
entered the room in time to see a man leaping through the window into the
street. He ran quickly to seize him or discover who he was, but he was
unable to effect either purpose, for Leonela flung her arms round him
crying, “Be calm, señor; do not give way to passion or follow him who has
escaped from this; he belongs to me, and in fact he is my husband.”
</p>
<p>
Anselmo would not believe it, but blind with rage drew a dagger and
threatened to stab Leonela, bidding her tell the truth or he would kill
her. She, in her fear, not knowing what she was saying, exclaimed, “Do not
kill me, señor, for I can tell you things more important than any you can
imagine.”
</p>
<p>
“Tell me then at once or thou diest,” said Anselmo.
</p>
<p>
“It would be impossible for me now,” said Leonela, “I am so agitated:
leave me till to-morrow, and then you shall hear from me what will fill
you with astonishment; but rest assured that he who leaped through the
window is a young man of this city, who has given me his promise to become
my husband.”
</p>
<p>
Anselmo was appeased with this, and was content to wait the time she asked
of him, for he never expected to hear anything against Camilla, so
satisfied and sure of her virtue was he; and so he quitted the room, and
left Leonela locked in, telling her she should not come out until she had
told him all she had to make known to him. He went at once to see Camilla,
and tell her, as he did, all that had passed between him and her handmaid,
and the promise she had given him to inform him matters of serious
importance.
</p>
<p>
There is no need of saying whether Camilla was agitated or not, for so
great was her fear and dismay, that, making sure, as she had good reason
to do, that Leonela would tell Anselmo all she knew of her faithlessness,
she had not the courage to wait and see if her suspicions were confirmed;
and that same night, as soon as she thought that Anselmo was asleep, she
packed up the most valuable jewels she had and some money, and without
being observed by anybody escaped from the house and betook herself to
Lothario’s, to whom she related what had occurred, imploring him to convey
her to some place of safety or fly with her where they might be safe from
Anselmo. The state of perplexity to which Camilla reduced Lothario was
such that he was unable to utter a word in reply, still less to decide
upon what he should do. At length he resolved to conduct her to a convent
of which a sister of his was prioress; Camilla agreed to this, and with
the speed which the circumstances demanded, Lothario took her to the
convent and left her there, and then himself quitted the city without
letting anyone know of his departure.
</p>
<p>
As soon as daylight came Anselmo, without missing Camilla from his side,
rose eager to learn what Leonela had to tell him, and hastened to the room
where he had locked her in. He opened the door, entered, but found no
Leonela; all he found was some sheets knotted to the window, a plain proof
that she had let herself down from it and escaped. He returned, uneasy, to
tell Camilla, but not finding her in bed or anywhere in the house he was
lost in amazement. He asked the servants of the house about her, but none
of them could give him any explanation. As he was going in search of
Camilla it happened by chance that he observed her boxes were lying open,
and that the greater part of her jewels were gone; and now he became fully
aware of his disgrace, and that Leonela was not the cause of his
misfortune; and, just as he was, without delaying to dress himself
completely, he repaired, sad at heart and dejected, to his friend Lothario
to make known his sorrow to him; but when he failed to find him and the
servants reported that he had been absent from his house all night and had
taken with him all the money he had, he felt as though he were losing his
senses; and to make all complete on returning to his own house he found it
deserted and empty, not one of all his servants, male or female, remaining
in it. He knew not what to think, or say, or do, and his reason seemed to
be deserting him little by little. He reviewed his position, and saw
himself in a moment left without wife, friend, or servants, abandoned, he
felt, by the heaven above him, and more than all robbed of his honour, for
in Camilla’s disappearance he saw his own ruin. After long reflection he
resolved at last to go to his friend’s village, where he had been staying
when he afforded opportunities for the contrivance of this complication of
misfortune. He locked the doors of his house, mounted his horse, and with
a broken spirit set out on his journey; but he had hardly gone half-way
when, harassed by his reflections, he had to dismount and tie his horse to
a tree, at the foot of which he threw himself, giving vent to piteous
heartrending sighs; and there he remained till nearly nightfall, when he
observed a man approaching on horseback from the city, of whom, after
saluting him, he asked what was the news in Florence.
</p>
<p>
The citizen replied, “The strangest that have been heard for many a day;
for it is reported abroad that Lothario, the great friend of the wealthy
Anselmo, who lived at San Giovanni, carried off last night Camilla, the
wife of Anselmo, who also has disappeared. All this has been told by a
maid-servant of Camilla’s, whom the governor found last night lowering
herself by a sheet from the windows of Anselmo’s house. I know not indeed,
precisely, how the affair came to pass; all I know is that the whole city
is wondering at the occurrence, for no one could have expected a thing of
the kind, seeing the great and intimate friendship that existed between
them, so great, they say, that they were called ‘The Two Friends.’”
</p>
<p>
“Is it known at all,” said Anselmo, “what road Lothario and Camilla took?”
</p>
<p>
“Not in the least,” said the citizen, “though the governor has been very
active in searching for them.”
</p>
<p>
“God speed you, señor,” said Anselmo.
</p>
<p>
“God be with you,” said the citizen and went his way.
</p>
<p>
This disastrous intelligence almost robbed Anselmo not only of his senses
but of his life. He got up as well as he was able and reached the house of
his friend, who as yet knew nothing of his misfortune, but seeing him come
pale, worn, and haggard, perceived that he was suffering some heavy
affliction. Anselmo at once begged to be allowed to retire to rest, and to
be given writing materials. His wish was complied with and he was left
lying down and alone, for he desired this, and even that the door should
be locked. Finding himself alone he so took to heart the thought of his
misfortune that by the signs of death he felt within him he knew well his
life was drawing to a close, and therefore he resolved to leave behind him
a declaration of the cause of his strange end. He began to write, but
before he had put down all he meant to say, his breath failed him and he
yielded up his life, a victim to the suffering which his ill-advised
curiosity had entailed upon him. The master of the house observing that it
was now late and that Anselmo did not call, determined to go in and
ascertain if his indisposition was increasing, and found him lying on his
face, his body partly in the bed, partly on the writing-table, on which he
lay with the written paper open and the pen still in his hand. Having
first called to him without receiving any answer, his host approached him,
and taking him by the hand, found that it was cold, and saw that he was
dead. Greatly surprised and distressed he summoned the household to
witness the sad fate which had befallen Anselmo; and then he read the
paper, the handwriting of which he recognised as his, and which contained
these words:
</p>
<p>
“A foolish and ill-advised desire has robbed me of life. If the news of my
death should reach the ears of Camilla, let her know that I forgive her,
for she was not bound to perform miracles, nor ought I to have required
her to perform them; and since I have been the author of my own dishonour,
there is no reason why—”
</p>
<p>
So far Anselmo had written, and thus it was plain that at this point,
before he could finish what he had to say, his life came to an end. The
next day his friend sent intelligence of his death to his relatives, who
had already ascertained his misfortune, as well as the convent where
Camilla lay almost on the point of accompanying her husband on that
inevitable journey, not on account of the tidings of his death, but
because of those she received of her lover’s departure. Although she saw
herself a widow, it is said she refused either to quit the convent or take
the veil, until, not long afterwards, intelligence reached her that
Lothario had been killed in a battle in which M. de Lautrec had been
recently engaged with the Great Captain Gonzalo Fernandez de Cordova in
the kingdom of Naples, whither her too late repentant lover had repaired.
On learning this Camilla took the veil, and shortly afterwards died, worn
out by grief and melancholy. This was the end of all three, an end that
came of a thoughtless beginning.
</p>
<p>
“I like this novel,” said the curate; “but I cannot persuade myself of its
truth; and if it has been invented, the author’s invention is faulty, for
it is impossible to imagine any husband so foolish as to try such a costly
experiment as Anselmo’s. If it had been represented as occurring between a
gallant and his mistress it might pass; but between husband and wife there
is something of an impossibility about it. As to the way in which the
story is told, however, I have no fault to find.”

</p>
<p>
Just at that instant the landlord, who was standing at the gate of the
inn, exclaimed, “Here comes a fine troop of guests; if they stop here we
may say <i>gaudeamus</i>.”
</p>
<p>
“What are they?” said Cardenio.
</p>
<p>
“Four men,” said the landlord, “riding <i>à la jineta</i>,
with lances and bucklers, and all with black veils, and with them there is a
woman in white on a side-saddle, whose face is also veiled, and two attendants
on foot.”
</p>
<p>
“Are they very near?” said the curate.
</p>
<p>
“So near,” answered the landlord, “that here they come.”
</p>
<p>
Hearing this Dorothea covered her face, and Cardenio retreated into Don
Quixote’s room, and they hardly had time to do so before the whole party
the host had described entered the inn, and the four that were on
horseback, who were of highbred appearance and bearing, dismounted, and
came forward to take down the woman who rode on the side-saddle, and one
of them taking her in his arms placed her in a chair that stood at the
entrance of the room where Cardenio had hidden himself. All this time
neither she nor they had removed their veils or spoken a word, only on
sitting down on the chair the woman gave a deep sigh and let her arms fall
like one that was ill and weak. The attendants on foot then led the horses
away to the stable. Observing this the curate, curious to know who these
people in such a dress and preserving such silence were, went to where the
servants were standing and put the question to one of them, who answered
him.
</p>
<p>
“Faith, sir, I cannot tell you who they are, I only know they seem to be
people of distinction, particularly he who advanced to take the lady you
saw in his arms; and I say so because all the rest show him respect, and
nothing is done except what he directs and orders.”
</p>
<p>
“And the lady, who is she?” asked the curate.
</p>
<p>
“That I cannot tell you either,” said the servant, “for I have not seen
her face all the way: I have indeed heard her sigh many times and utter
such groans that she seems to be giving up the ghost every time; but it is
no wonder if we do not know more than we have told you, as my comrade and
I have only been in their company two days, for having met us on the road
they begged and persuaded us to accompany them to Andalusia, promising to
pay us well.”
</p>
<p>
“And have you heard any of them called by his name?” asked the curate.
</p>
<p>
“No, indeed,” replied the servant; “they all preserve a marvellous silence
on the road, for not a sound is to be heard among them except the poor
lady’s sighs and sobs, which make us pity her; and we feel sure that
wherever it is she is going, it is against her will, and as far as one can
judge from her dress she is a nun or, what is more likely, about to become
one; and perhaps it is because taking the vows is not of her own free
will, that she is so unhappy as she seems to be.”
</p>
<p>
“That may well be,” said the curate, and leaving them he returned to where
Dorothea was, who, hearing the veiled lady sigh, moved by natural
compassion drew near to her and said, “What are you suffering from,
señora? If it be anything that women are accustomed and know how to
relieve, I offer you my services with all my heart.”
</p>
<p>
To this the unhappy lady made no reply; and though Dorothea repeated her
offers more earnestly she still kept silence, until the gentleman with the
veil, who, the servant said, was obeyed by the rest, approached and said
to Dorothea, “Do not give yourself the trouble, señora, of making any
offers to that woman, for it is her way to give no thanks for anything
that is done for her; and do not try to make her answer unless you want to
hear some lie from her lips.”
</p>
<p>
“I have never told a lie,” was the immediate reply of her who had been
silent until now; “on the contrary, it is because I am so truthful and so
ignorant of lying devices that I am now in this miserable condition; and
this I call you yourself to witness, for it is my unstained truth that has
made you false and a liar.”
</p>
<p>
Cardenio heard these words clearly and distinctly, being quite close to
the speaker, for there was only the door of Don Quixote’s room between
them, and the instant he did so, uttering a loud exclamation he cried,
“Good God! what is this I hear? What voice is this that has reached my
ears?” Startled at the voice the lady turned her head; and not seeing the
speaker she stood up and attempted to enter the room; observing which the
gentleman held her back, preventing her from moving a step. In her
agitation and sudden movement the silk with which she had covered her face
fell off and disclosed a countenance of incomparable and marvellous
beauty, but pale and terrified; for she kept turning her eyes, everywhere
she could direct her gaze, with an eagerness that made her look as if she
had lost her senses, and so marked that it excited the pity of Dorothea
and all who beheld her, though they knew not what caused it. The gentleman
grasped her firmly by the shoulders, and being so fully occupied with
holding her back, he was unable to put a hand to his veil which was
falling off, as it did at length entirely, and Dorothea, who was holding
the lady in her arms, raising her eyes saw that he who likewise held her
was her husband, Don Fernando. The instant she recognised him, with a
prolonged plaintive cry drawn from the depths of her heart, she fell
backwards fainting, and but for the barber being close by to catch her in
his arms, she would have fallen completely to the ground. The curate at
once hastened to uncover her face and throw water on it, and as he did so
Don Fernando, for he it was who held the other in his arms, recognised her
and stood as if death-stricken by the sight; not, however, relaxing his
grasp of Luscinda, for it was she that was struggling to release herself
from his hold, having recognised Cardenio by his voice, as he had
recognised her. Cardenio also heard Dorothea’s cry as she fell fainting,
and imagining that it came from his Luscinda burst forth in terror from
the room, and the first thing he saw was Don Fernando with Luscinda in his
arms. Don Fernando, too, knew Cardenio at once; and all three, Luscinda,
Cardenio, and Dorothea, stood in silent amazement scarcely knowing what
had happened to them.
</p>
<p>
They gazed at one another without speaking, Dorothea at Don Fernando, Don
Fernando at Cardenio, Cardenio at Luscinda, and Luscinda at Cardenio. The
first to break silence was Luscinda, who thus addressed Don Fernando:
“Leave me, Señor Don Fernando, for the sake of what you owe to yourself;
if no other reason will induce you, leave me to cling to the wall of which
I am the ivy, to the support from which neither your importunities, nor
your threats, nor your promises, nor your gifts have been able to detach
me. See how Heaven, by ways strange and hidden from our sight, has brought
me face to face with my true husband; and well you know by dear-bought
experience that death alone will be able to efface him from my memory. May
this plain declaration, then, lead you, as you can do nothing else, to
turn your love into rage, your affection into resentment, and so to take
my life; for if I yield it up in the presence of my beloved husband I
count it well bestowed; it may be by my death he will be convinced that I
kept my faith to him to the last moment of life.”
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile Dorothea had come to herself, and had heard Luscinda’s words, by
means of which she divined who she was; but seeing that Don Fernando did
not yet release her or reply to her, summoning up her resolution as well
as she could she rose and knelt at his feet, and with a flood of bright
and touching tears addressed him thus:
</p>
<p>
“If, my lord, the beams of that sun that thou holdest eclipsed in thine
arms did not dazzle and rob thine eyes of sight thou wouldst have seen by
this time that she who kneels at thy feet is, so long as thou wilt have it
so, the unhappy and unfortunate Dorothea. I am that lowly peasant girl
whom thou in thy goodness or for thy pleasure wouldst raise high enough to
call herself thine; I am she who in the seclusion of innocence led a
contented life until at the voice of thy importunity, and thy true and
tender passion, as it seemed, she opened the gates of her modesty and
surrendered to thee the keys of her liberty; a gift received by thee but
thanklessly, as is clearly shown by my forced retreat to the place where
thou dost find me, and by thy appearance under the circumstances in which
I see thee. Nevertheless, I would not have thee suppose that I have come
here driven by my shame; it is only grief and sorrow at seeing myself
forgotten by thee that have led me. It was thy will to make me thine, and
thou didst so follow thy will, that now, even though thou repentest, thou
canst not help being mine. Bethink thee, my lord, the unsurpassable
affection I bear thee may compensate for the beauty and noble birth for
which thou wouldst desert me. Thou canst not be the fair Luscinda’s
because thou art mine, nor can she be thine because she is Cardenio’s; and
it will be easier, remember, to bend thy will to love one who adores thee,
than to lead one to love thee who abhors thee now. Thou didst address
thyself to my simplicity, thou didst lay siege to my virtue, thou wert not
ignorant of my station, well dost thou know how I yielded wholly to thy
will; there is no ground or reason for thee to plead deception, and if it
be so, as it is, and if thou art a Christian as thou art a gentleman, why
dost thou by such subterfuges put off making me as happy at last as thou
didst at first? And if thou wilt not have me for what I am, thy true and
lawful wife, at least take and accept me as thy slave, for so long as I am
thine I will count myself happy and fortunate. Do not by deserting me let
my shame become the talk of the gossips in the streets; make not the old
age of my parents miserable; for the loyal services they as faithful
vassals have ever rendered thine are not deserving of such a return; and
if thou thinkest it will debase thy blood to mingle it with mine, reflect
that there is little or no nobility in the world that has not travelled
the same road, and that in illustrious lineages it is not the woman’s
blood that is of account; and, moreover, that true nobility consists in
virtue, and if thou art wanting in that, refusing me what in justice thou
owest me, then even I have higher claims to nobility than thine. To make
an end, señor, these are my last words to thee: whether thou wilt, or wilt
not, I am thy wife; witness thy words, which must not and ought not to be
false, if thou dost pride thyself on that for want of which thou scornest
me; witness the pledge which thou didst give me, and witness Heaven, which
thou thyself didst call to witness the promise thou hadst made me; and if
all this fail, thy own conscience will not fail to lift up its silent
voice in the midst of all thy gaiety, and vindicate the truth of what I
say and mar thy highest pleasure and enjoyment.”
</p>
<p>
All this and more the injured Dorothea delivered with such earnest feeling
and such tears that all present, even those who came with Don Fernando,
were constrained to join her in them. Don Fernando listened to her without
replying, until, ceasing to speak, she gave way to such sobs and sighs
that it must have been a heart of brass that was not softened by the sight
of so great sorrow. Luscinda stood regarding her with no less compassion
for her sufferings than admiration for her intelligence and beauty, and
would have gone to her to say some words of comfort to her, but was
prevented by Don Fernando’s grasp which held her fast. He, overwhelmed
with confusion and astonishment, after regarding Dorothea for some moments
with a fixed gaze, opened his arms, and, releasing Luscinda, exclaimed:
</p>
<p>
“Thou hast conquered, fair Dorothea, thou hast conquered, for it is
impossible to have the heart to deny the united force of so many truths.”
</p>
<p>
Luscinda in her feebleness was on the point of falling to the ground when
Don Fernando released her, but Cardenio, who stood near, having retreated
behind Don Fernando to escape recognition, casting fear aside and
regardless of what might happen, ran forward to support her, and said as
he clasped her in his arms, “If Heaven in its compassion is willing to let
thee rest at last, mistress of my heart, true, constant, and fair, nowhere
canst thou rest more safely than in these arms that now receive thee, and
received thee before when fortune permitted me to call thee mine.”
</p>
<p>
At these words Luscinda looked up at Cardenio, at first beginning to
recognise him by his voice and then satisfying herself by her eyes that it
was he, and hardly knowing what she did, and heedless of all
considerations of decorum, she flung her arms around his neck and pressing
her face close to his, said, “Yes, my dear lord, you are the true master
of this your slave, even though adverse fate interpose again, and fresh
dangers threaten this life that hangs on yours.”
</p>
<p>
A strange sight was this for Don Fernando and those that stood around,
filled with surprise at an incident so unlooked for. Dorothea fancied that
Don Fernando changed colour and looked as though he meant to take
vengeance on Cardenio, for she observed him put his hand to his sword; and
the instant the idea struck her, with wonderful quickness she clasped him
round the knees, and kissing them and holding him so as to prevent his
moving, she said, while her tears continued to flow, “What is it thou
wouldst do, my only refuge, in this unforeseen event? Thou hast thy wife
at thy feet, and she whom thou wouldst have for thy wife is in the arms of
her husband: reflect whether it will be right for thee, whether it will be
possible for thee to undo what Heaven has done, or whether it will be
becoming in thee to seek to raise her to be thy mate who in spite of every
obstacle, and strong in her truth and constancy, is before thine eyes,
bathing with the tears of love the face and bosom of her lawful husband.
For God’s sake I entreat of thee, for thine own I implore thee, let not
this open manifestation rouse thy anger; but rather so calm it as to allow
these two lovers to live in peace and quiet without any interference from
thee so long as Heaven permits them; and in so doing thou wilt prove the
generosity of thy lofty noble spirit, and the world shall see that with
thee reason has more influence than passion.”
</p>
<p>
All the time Dorothea was speaking, Cardenio, though he held Luscinda in
his arms, never took his eyes off Don Fernando, determined, if he saw him
make any hostile movement, to try and defend himself and resist as best he
could all who might assail him, though it should cost him his life. But
now Don Fernando’s friends, as well as the curate and the barber, who had
been present all the while, not forgetting the worthy Sancho Panza, ran
forward and gathered round Don Fernando, entreating him to have regard for
the tears of Dorothea, and not suffer her reasonable hopes to be
disappointed, since, as they firmly believed, what she said was but the
truth; and bidding him observe that it was not, as it might seem, by
accident, but by a special disposition of Providence that they had all met
in a place where no one could have expected a meeting. And the curate bade
him remember that only death could part Luscinda from Cardenio; that even
if some sword were to separate them they would think their death most
happy; and that in a case that admitted of no remedy his wisest course
was, by conquering and putting a constraint upon himself, to show a
generous mind, and of his own accord suffer these two to enjoy the
happiness Heaven had granted them. He bade him, too, turn his eyes upon
the beauty of Dorothea and he would see that few if any could equal much
less excel her; while to that beauty should be added her modesty and the
surpassing love she bore him. But besides all this, he reminded him that
if he prided himself on being a gentleman and a Christian, he could not do
otherwise than keep his plighted word; and that in doing so he would obey
God and meet the approval of all sensible people, who know and recognised
it to be the privilege of beauty, even in one of humble birth, provided
virtue accompany it, to be able to raise itself to the level of any rank,
without any slur upon him who places it upon an equality with himself; and
furthermore that when the potent sway of passion asserts itself, so long
as there be no mixture of sin in it, he is not to be blamed who gives way
to it.
</p>
<p>
To be brief, they added to these such other forcible arguments that Don
Fernando’s manly heart, being after all nourished by noble blood, was
touched, and yielded to the truth which, even had he wished it, he could
not gainsay; and he showed his submission, and acceptance of the good
advice that had been offered to him, by stooping down and embracing
Dorothea, saying to her, “Rise, dear lady, it is not right that what I
hold in my heart should be kneeling at my feet; and if until now I have
shown no sign of what I own, it may have been by Heaven’s decree in order
that, seeing the constancy with which you love me, I may learn to value
you as you deserve. What I entreat of you is that you reproach me not with
my transgression and grievous wrong-doing; for the same cause and force
that drove me to make you mine impelled me to struggle against being
yours; and to prove this, turn and look at the eyes of the now happy
Luscinda, and you will see in them an excuse for all my errors: and as she
has found and gained the object of her desires, and I have found in you
what satisfies all my wishes, may she live in peace and contentment as
many happy years with her Cardenio, as on my knees I pray Heaven to allow
me to live with my Dorothea;” and with these words he once more embraced
her and pressed his face to hers with so much tenderness that he had to
take great heed to keep his tears from completing the proof of his love
and repentance in the sight of all. Not so Luscinda, and Cardenio, and
almost all the others, for they shed so many tears, some in their own
happiness, some at that of the others, that one would have supposed a
heavy calamity had fallen upon them all. Even Sancho Panza was weeping;
though afterwards he said he only wept because he saw that Dorothea was
not as he fancied the queen Micomicona, of whom he expected such great
favours. Their wonder as well as their weeping lasted some time, and then
Cardenio and Luscinda went and fell on their knees before Don Fernando,
returning him thanks for the favour he had rendered them in language so
grateful that he knew not how to answer them, and raising them up embraced
them with every mark of affection and courtesy.
</p>
<p>
He then asked Dorothea how she had managed to reach a place so far removed
from her own home, and she in a few fitting words told all that she had
previously related to Cardenio, with which Don Fernando and his companions
were so delighted that they wished the story had been longer; so
charmingly did Dorothea describe her misadventures. When she had finished
Don Fernando recounted what had befallen him in the city after he had
found in Luscinda’s bosom the paper in which she declared that she was
Cardenio’s wife, and never could be his. He said he meant to kill her, and
would have done so had he not been prevented by her parents, and that he
quitted the house full of rage and shame, and resolved to avenge himself
when a more convenient opportunity should offer. The next day he learned
that Luscinda had disappeared from her father’s house, and that no one
could tell whither she had gone. Finally, at the end of some months he
ascertained that she was in a convent and meant to remain there all the
rest of her life, if she were not to share it with Cardenio; and as soon
as he had learned this, taking these three gentlemen as his companions, he
arrived at the place where she was, but avoided speaking to her, fearing
that if it were known he was there stricter precautions would be taken in
the convent; and watching a time when the porter’s lodge was open he left
two to guard the gate, and he and the other entered the convent in quest
of Luscinda, whom they found in the cloisters in conversation with one of
the nuns, and carrying her off without giving her time to resist, they
reached a place with her where they provided themselves with what they
required for taking her away; all which they were able to do in complete
safety, as the convent was in the country at a considerable distance from
the city. He added that when Luscinda found herself in his power she lost
all consciousness, and after returning to herself did nothing but weep and
sigh without speaking a word; and thus in silence and tears they reached
that inn, which for him was reaching heaven where all the mischances of
earth are over and at an end.

<p>
To all this Sancho listened with no little sorrow at heart to see how his
hopes of dignity were fading away and vanishing in smoke, and how the fair
Princess Micomicona had turned into Dorothea, and the giant into Don
Fernando, while his master was sleeping tranquilly, totally unconscious of
all that had come to pass. Dorothea was unable to persuade herself that
her present happiness was not all a dream; Cardenio was in a similar state
of mind, and Luscinda’s thoughts ran in the same direction. Don Fernando
gave thanks to Heaven for the favour shown to him and for having been
rescued from the intricate labyrinth in which he had been brought so near
the destruction of his good name and of his soul; and in short everybody
in the inn was full of contentment and satisfaction at the happy issue of
such a complicated and hopeless business. The curate as a sensible man
made sound reflections upon the whole affair, and congratulated each upon
his good fortune; but the one that was in the highest spirits and good
humour was the landlady, because of the promise Cardenio and the curate
had given her to pay for all the losses and damage she had sustained
through Don Quixote’s means. Sancho, as has been already said, was the
only one who was distressed, unhappy, and dejected; and so with a long
face he went in to his master, who had just awoke, and said to him:
</p>
<p>
“Sir Rueful Countenance, your worship may as well sleep on as much as you
like, without troubling yourself about killing any giant or restoring her
kingdom to the princess; for that is all over and settled now.”
</p>
<p>
“I should think it was,” replied Don Quixote, “for I have had the most
prodigious and stupendous battle with the giant that I ever remember
having had all the days of my life; and with one back-stroke—swish!—I
brought his head tumbling to the ground, and so much blood gushed forth
from him that it ran in rivulets over the earth like water.”
</p>
<p>
“Like red wine, your worship had better say,” replied Sancho; “for I would
have you know, if you don’t know it, that the dead giant is a hacked
wine-skin, and the blood four-and-twenty gallons of red wine that it had
in its belly, and the cut-off head is the bitch that bore me; and the
devil take it all.”
</p>
<p>
“What art thou talking about, fool?” said Don Quixote; “art thou in thy
senses?”
</p>
<p>
“Let your worship get up,” said Sancho, “and you will see the nice
business you have made of it, and what we have to pay; and you will see
the queen turned into a private lady called Dorothea, and other things
that will astonish you, if you understand them.”
</p>
<p>
“I shall not be surprised at anything of the kind,” returned Don Quixote;
“for if thou dost remember the last time we were here I told thee that
everything that happened here was a matter of enchantment, and it would be
no wonder if it were the same now.”
</p>
<p>
“I could believe all that,” replied Sancho, “if my blanketing was the same
sort of thing also; only it wasn’t, but real and genuine; for I saw the
landlord, who is here to-day, holding one end of the blanket and jerking
me up to the skies very neatly and smartly, and with as much laughter as
strength; and when it comes to be a case of knowing people, I hold for my
part, simple and sinner as I am, that there is no enchantment about it at
all, but a great deal of bruising and bad luck.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, well, God will give a remedy,” said Don Quixote; “hand me my
clothes and let me go out, for I want to see these transformations and
things thou speakest of.”
</p>
<p>
Sancho fetched him his clothes; and while he was dressing, the curate gave
Don Fernando and the others present an account of Don Quixote’s madness
and of the stratagem they had made use of to withdraw him from that Pena
Pobre where he fancied himself stationed because of his lady’s scorn. He
described to them also nearly all the adventures that Sancho had
mentioned, at which they marvelled and laughed not a little, thinking it,
as all did, the strangest form of madness a crazy intellect could be
capable of. But now, the curate said, that the lady Dorothea’s good
fortune prevented her from proceeding with their purpose, it would be
necessary to devise or discover some other way of getting him home.
</p>
<p>
Cardenio proposed to carry out the scheme they had begun, and suggested
that Luscinda would act and support Dorothea’s part sufficiently well.
</p>
<p>
“No,” said Don Fernando, “that must not be, for I want Dorothea to follow
out this idea of hers; and if the worthy gentleman’s village is not very
far off, I shall be happy if I can do anything for his relief.”
</p>
<p>
“It is not more than two days’ journey from this,” said the curate.
</p>
<p>
“Even if it were more,” said Don Fernando, “I would gladly travel so far
for the sake of doing so good a work.”
</p>
<p>
At this moment Don Quixote came out in full panoply, with Mambrino’s
helmet, all dinted as it was, on his head, his buckler on his arm, and
leaning on his staff or pike. The strange figure he presented filled Don
Fernando and the rest with amazement as they contemplated his lean yellow
face half a league long, his armour of all sorts, and the solemnity of his
deportment. They stood silent waiting to see what he would say, and he,
fixing his eyes on the fair Dorothea, addressed her with great gravity and
composure:
</p>
<p>
“I am informed, fair lady, by my squire here that your greatness has been
annihilated and your being abolished, since, from a queen and lady of high
degree as you used to be, you have been turned into a private maiden. If
this has been done by the command of the magician king your father,
through fear that I should not afford you the aid you need and are
entitled to, I may tell you he did not know and does not know half the
mass, and was little versed in the annals of chivalry; for, if he had read
and gone through them as attentively and deliberately as I have, he would
have found at every turn that knights of less renown than mine have
accomplished things more difficult: it is no great matter to kill a whelp
of a giant, however arrogant he may be; for it is not many hours since I
myself was engaged with one, and—I will not speak of it, that they
may not say I am lying; time, however, that reveals all, will tell the
tale when we least expect it.”
</p>
<p>
“You were engaged with a couple of wine-skins, and not a giant,” said the
landlord at this; but Don Fernando told him to hold his tongue and on no
account interrupt Don Quixote, who continued, “I say in conclusion, high
and disinherited lady, that if your father has brought about this
metamorphosis in your person for the reason I have mentioned, you ought
not to attach any importance to it; for there is no peril on earth through
which my sword will not force a way, and with it, before many days are
over, I will bring your enemy’s head to the ground and place on yours the
crown of your kingdom.”
</p>
<p>
Don Quixote said no more, and waited for the reply of the princess, who
aware of Don Fernando’s determination to carry on the deception until Don
Quixote had been conveyed to his home, with great ease of manner and
gravity made answer, “Whoever told you, valiant Knight of the Rueful
Countenance, that I had undergone any change or transformation did not
tell you the truth, for I am the same as I was yesterday. It is true that
certain strokes of good fortune, that have given me more than I could have
hoped for, have made some alteration in me; but I have not therefore
ceased to be what I was before, or to entertain the same desire I have had
all through of availing myself of the might of your valiant and invincible
arm. And so, señor, let your goodness reinstate the father that begot me
in your good opinion, and be assured that he was a wise and prudent man,
since by his craft he found out such a sure and easy way of remedying my
misfortune; for I believe, señor, that had it not been for you I should
never have lit upon the good fortune I now possess; and in this I am
saying what is perfectly true; as most of these gentlemen who are present
can fully testify. All that remains is to set out on our journey
to-morrow, for to-day we could not make much way; and for the rest of the
happy result I am looking forward to, I trust to God and the valour of
your heart.”
</p>
<p>
So said the sprightly Dorothea, and on hearing her Don Quixote turned to
Sancho, and said to him, with an angry air, “I declare now, little Sancho,
thou art the greatest little villain in Spain. Say, thief and vagabond,
hast thou not just now told me that this princess had been turned into a
maiden called Dorothea, and that the head which I am persuaded I cut off
from a giant was the bitch that bore thee, and other nonsense that put me
in the greatest perplexity I have ever been in all my life? I vow” (and
here he looked to heaven and ground his teeth) “I have a mind to play the
mischief with thee, in a way that will teach sense for the future to all
lying squires of knights-errant in the world.”
</p>
<p>
“Let your worship be calm, señor,” returned Sancho, “for it may well be
that I have been mistaken as to the change of the lady princess
Micomicona; but as to the giant’s head, or at least as to the piercing of
the wine-skins, and the blood being red wine, I make no mistake, as sure
as there is a God; because the wounded skins are there at the head of your
worship’s bed, and the wine has made a lake of the room; if not you will
see when the eggs come to be fried; I mean when his worship the landlord
calls for all the damages: for the rest, I am heartily glad that her
ladyship the queen is as she was, for it concerns me as much as anyone.”
</p>
<p>
“I tell thee again, Sancho, thou art a fool,” said Don Quixote; “forgive
me, and that will do.”
</p>
<p>
“That will do,” said Don Fernando; “let us say no more about it; and as
her ladyship the princess proposes to set out to-morrow because it is too
late to-day, so be it, and we will pass the night in pleasant
conversation, and to-morrow we will all accompany Señor Don Quixote; for
we wish to witness the valiant and unparalleled achievements he is about
to perform in the course of this mighty enterprise which he has
undertaken.”
</p>
<p>
“It is I who shall wait upon and accompany you,” said Don Quixote; “and I
am much gratified by the favour that is bestowed upon me, and the good
opinion entertained of me, which I shall strive to justify or it shall
cost me my life, or even more, if it can possibly cost me more.”
</p>
<p>
Many were the compliments and expressions of politeness that passed
between Don Quixote and Don Fernando; but they were brought to an end by a
traveller who at this moment entered the inn, and who seemed from his
attire to be a Christian lately come from the country of the Moors, for he
was dressed in a short-skirted coat of blue cloth with half-sleeves and
without a collar; his breeches were also of blue cloth, and his cap of the
same colour, and he wore yellow buskins and had a Moorish cutlass slung
from a baldric across his breast. Behind him, mounted upon an ass, there
came a woman dressed in Moorish fashion, with her face veiled and a scarf
on her head, and wearing a little brocaded cap, and a mantle that covered
her from her shoulders to her feet. The man was of a robust and
well-proportioned frame, in age a little over forty, rather swarthy in
complexion, with long moustaches and a full beard, and, in short, his
appearance was such that if he had been well dressed he would have been
taken for a person of quality and good birth. On entering he asked for a
room, and when they told him there was none in the inn he seemed
distressed, and approaching her who by her dress seemed to be a Moor, he took
her down from the saddle in his arms. Luscinda, Dorothea, the landlady, her
daughter and Maritornes, attracted by the strange, and to them entirely
new costume, gathered round her; and Dorothea, who was always kindly,
courteous, and quick-witted, perceiving that both she and the man who had
brought her were annoyed at not finding a room, said to her, “Do not be
put out, señora, by the discomfort and want of luxuries here, for it is
the way of road-side inns to be without them; still, if you will be
pleased to share our lodging with us (pointing to Luscinda) perhaps you
will have found worse accommodation in the course of your journey.”
</p>
<p>
To this the veiled lady made no reply; all she did was to rise from her
seat, crossing her hands upon her bosom, bowing her head and bending her
body as a sign that she returned thanks. From her silence they concluded
that she must be a Moor and unable to speak a Christian tongue.
</p>
<p>
At this moment the captive came up, having been until now otherwise
engaged, and seeing that they all stood round his companion and that she
made no reply to what they addressed to her, he said, “Ladies, this damsel
hardly understands my language and can speak none but that of her own
country, for which reason she does not and cannot answer what has been
asked of her.”
</p>
<p>
“Nothing has been asked of her,” returned Luscinda; “she has only been
offered our company for this evening and a share of the quarters we
occupy, where she shall be made as comfortable as the circumstances allow,
with the good-will we are bound to show all strangers that stand in need
of it, especially if it be a woman to whom the service is rendered.”
</p>
<p>
“On her part and my own, señora,” replied the captive, “I kiss your hands,
and I esteem highly, as I ought, the favour you have offered, which, on
such an occasion and coming from persons of your appearance, is, it is
plain to see, a very great one.”
</p>
<p>
“Tell me, señor,” said Dorothea, “is this lady a Christian or a Moor? for
her dress and her silence lead us to imagine that she is what we could
wish she was not.”
</p>
<p>
“In dress and outwardly,” said he, “she is a Moor, but at heart she is a
thoroughly good Christian, for she has the greatest desire to become one.”
</p>
<p>
“Then she has not been baptised?” returned Luscinda.
</p>
<p>
“There has been no opportunity for that,” replied the captive, “since she
left Algiers, her native country and home; and up to the present she has
not found herself in any such imminent danger of death as to make it
necessary to baptise her before she has been instructed in all the
ceremonies our holy mother Church ordains; but, please God, ere long she
shall be baptised with the solemnity befitting her which is higher than
her dress or mine indicates.”
</p>
<p>
By these words he excited a desire in all who heard him, to know who the
Moorish lady and the captive were, but no one liked to ask just then,
seeing that it was a fitter moment for helping them to rest themselves
than for questioning them about their lives. Dorothea took the Moorish
lady by the hand and leading her to a seat beside herself, requested her
to remove her veil. She looked at the captive as if to ask him what they
meant and what she was to do. He said to her in Arabic that they asked her
to take off her veil, and thereupon she removed it and disclosed a
countenance so lovely, that to Dorothea she seemed more beautiful than
Luscinda, and to Luscinda more beautiful than Dorothea, and all the
bystanders felt that if any beauty could compare with theirs it was the
Moorish lady’s, and there were even those who were inclined to give it
somewhat the preference. And as it is the privilege and charm of beauty to
win the heart and secure good-will, all forthwith became eager to show
kindness and attention to the lovely Moor.
</p>
<p>
Don Fernando asked the captive what her name was, and he replied that it
was Lela Zoraida; but the instant she heard him, she guessed what the
Christian had asked, and said hastily, with some displeasure and energy,
“No, not Zoraida; Maria, Maria!” giving them to understand that she was
called “Maria” and not “Zoraida.” These words, and the touching
earnestness with which she uttered them, drew more than one tear from some
of the listeners, particularly the women, who are by nature tender-hearted
and compassionate. Luscinda embraced her affectionately, saying, “Yes,
yes, Maria, Maria,” to which the Moor replied, “Yes, yes, Maria; Zoraida
macange,” which means “not Zoraida.”
</p>
<p>
Night was now approaching, and by the orders of those who accompanied Don
Fernando the landlord had taken care and pains to prepare for them the
best supper that was in his power. The hour therefore having arrived they
all took their seats at a long table like a refectory one, for round or
square table there was none in the inn, and the seat of honour at the head
of it, though he was for refusing it, they assigned to Don Quixote, who
desired the lady Micomicona to place herself by his side, as he was her
protector. Luscinda and Zoraida took their places next her, opposite to
them were Don Fernando and Cardenio, and next the captive and the other
gentlemen, and by the side of the ladies, the curate and the barber. And
so they supped in high enjoyment, which was increased when they observed
Don Quixote leave off eating, and, moved by an impulse like that which
made him deliver himself at such length when he supped with the goatherds,
begin to address them:
</p>
<p>
“Verily, gentlemen, if we reflect upon it, great and marvellous are the
things they see, who make profession of the order of knight-errantry. Say,
what being is there in this world, who entering the gate of this castle at
this moment, and seeing us as we are here, would suppose or imagine us to
be what we are? Who would say that this lady who is beside me was the
great queen that we all know her to be, or that I am that Knight of the
Rueful Countenance, trumpeted far and wide by the mouth of Fame? Now,
there can be no doubt that this art and calling surpasses all those that
mankind has invented, and is the more deserving of being held in honour in
proportion as it is the more exposed to peril. Away with those who assert
that letters have the preeminence over arms; I will tell them, whosoever
they may be, that they know not what they say. For the reason which such
persons commonly assign, and upon which they chiefly rest, is, that the
labours of the mind are greater than those of the body, and that arms give
employment to the body alone; as if the calling were a porter’s trade, for
which nothing more is required than sturdy strength; or as if, in what we
who profess them call arms, there were not included acts of vigour for the
execution of which high intelligence is requisite; or as if the soul of
the warrior, when he has an army, or the defence of a city under his care,
did not exert itself as much by mind as by body. Nay; see whether by
bodily strength it be possible to learn or divine the intentions of the
enemy, his plans, stratagems, or obstacles, or to ward off impending
mischief; for all these are the work of the mind, and in them the body has
no share whatever. Since, therefore, arms have need of the mind, as much
as letters, let us see now which of the two minds, that of the man of
letters or that of the warrior, has most to do; and this will be seen by
the end and goal that each seeks to attain; for that purpose is the more
estimable which has for its aim the nobler object. The end and goal of
letters—I am not speaking now of divine letters, the aim of which is
to raise and direct the soul to Heaven; for with an end so infinite no
other can be compared—I speak of human letters, the end of which is
to establish distributive justice, give to every man that which is his,
and see and take care that good laws are observed: an end undoubtedly
noble, lofty, and deserving of high praise, but not such as should be
given to that sought by arms, which have for their end and object peace,
the greatest boon that men can desire in this life. The first good news
the world and mankind received was that which the angels announced on the
night that was our day, when they sang in the air, ‘Glory to God in the
highest, and peace on earth to men of good-will;’ and the salutation which
the great Master of heaven and earth taught his disciples and chosen
followers when they entered any house, was to say, ‘Peace be on this
house;’ and many other times he said to them, ‘My peace I give unto you,
my peace I leave you, peace be with you;’ a jewel and a precious gift
given and left by such a hand: a jewel without which there can be no
happiness either on earth or in heaven. This peace is the true end of war;
and war is only another name for arms. This, then, being admitted, that
the end of war is peace, and that so far it has the advantage of the end
of letters, let us turn to the bodily labours of the man of letters, and
those of him who follows the profession of arms, and see which are the
greater.”
</p>
<p>
Don Quixote delivered his discourse in such a manner and in such correct
language, that for the time being he made it impossible for any of his
hearers to consider him a madman; on the contrary, as they were mostly
gentlemen, to whom arms are an appurtenance by birth, they listened to him
with great pleasure as he continued: “Here, then, I say is what the
student has to undergo; first of all poverty: not that all are poor, but
to put the case as strongly as possible: and when I have said that he
endures poverty, I think nothing more need be said about his hard fortune,
for he who is poor has no share of the good things of life. This poverty
he suffers from in various ways, hunger, or cold, or nakedness, or all
together; but for all that it is not so extreme but that he gets something
to eat, though it may be at somewhat unseasonable hours and from the
leavings of the rich; for the greatest misery of the student is what they
themselves call ‘going out for soup,’ and there is always some neighbour’s
brazier or hearth for them, which, if it does not warm, at least tempers
the cold to them, and lastly, they sleep comfortably at night under a
roof. I will not go into other particulars, as for example want of shirts,
and no superabundance of shoes, thin and threadbare garments, and gorging
themselves to surfeit in their voracity when good luck has treated them to
a banquet of some sort. By this road that I have described, rough and
hard, stumbling here, falling there, getting up again to fall again, they
reach the rank they desire, and that once attained, we have seen many who
have passed these Syrtes and Scyllas and Charybdises, as if borne flying
on the wings of favouring fortune; we have seen them, I say, ruling and
governing the world from a chair, their hunger turned into satiety, their
cold into comfort, their nakedness into fine raiment, their sleep on a mat
into repose in holland and damask, the justly earned reward of their
virtue; but, contrasted and compared with what the warrior undergoes, all
they have undergone falls far short of it, as I am now about to show.”

Continuing his discourse Don Quixote said: “As we began in the student’s
case with poverty and its accompaniments, let us see now if the soldier is
richer, and we shall find that in poverty itself there is no one poorer;
for he is dependent on his miserable pay, which comes late or never, or
else on what he can plunder, seriously imperilling his life and
conscience; and sometimes his nakedness will be so great that a slashed
doublet serves him for uniform and shirt, and in the depth of winter he
has to defend himself against the inclemency of the weather in the open
field with nothing better than the breath of his mouth, which I need not
say, coming from an empty place, must come out cold, contrary to the laws
of nature. To be sure he looks forward to the approach of night to make up
for all these discomforts on the bed that awaits him, which, unless by
some fault of his, never sins by being over narrow, for he can easily
measure out on the ground as he likes, and roll himself about in it to his
heart’s content without any fear of the sheets slipping away from him.
Then, after all this, suppose the day and hour for taking his degree in
his calling to have come; suppose the day of battle to have arrived, when
they invest him with the doctor’s cap made of lint, to mend some
bullet-hole, perhaps, that has gone through his temples, or left him with
a crippled arm or leg. Or if this does not happen, and merciful Heaven
watches over him and keeps him safe and sound, it may be he will be in the
same poverty he was in before, and he must go through more engagements and
more battles, and come victorious out of all before he betters himself;
but miracles of that sort are seldom seen. For tell me, sirs, if you have
ever reflected upon it, by how much do those who have gained by war fall
short of the number of those who have perished in it? No doubt you will
reply that there can be no comparison, that the dead cannot be numbered,
while the living who have been rewarded may be summed up with three
figures. All which is the reverse in the case of men of letters; for by
skirts, to say nothing of sleeves, they all find means of support; so that
though the soldier has more to endure, his reward is much less. But
against all this it may be urged that it is easier to reward two thousand
soldiers, for the former may be remunerated by giving them places, which
must perforce be conferred upon men of their calling, while the latter can
only be recompensed out of the very property of the master they serve; but
this impossibility only strengthens my argument.
</p>
<p>
“Putting this, however, aside, for it is a puzzling question for which it
is difficult to find a solution, let us return to the superiority of arms
over letters, a matter still undecided, so many are the arguments put
forward on each side; for besides those I have mentioned, letters say that
without them arms cannot maintain themselves, for war, too, has its laws
and is governed by them, and laws belong to the domain of letters and men
of letters. To this arms make answer that without them laws cannot be
maintained, for by arms states are defended, kingdoms preserved, cities
protected, roads made safe, seas cleared of pirates; and, in short, if it
were not for them, states, kingdoms, monarchies, cities, ways by sea and
land would be exposed to the violence and confusion which war brings with
it, so long as it lasts and is free to make use of its privileges and
powers. And then it is plain that whatever costs most is valued and
deserves to be valued most. To attain to eminence in letters costs a man
time, watching, hunger, nakedness, headaches, indigestions, and other
things of the sort, some of which I have already referred to. But for a
man to come in the ordinary course of things to be a good soldier costs
him all the student suffers, and in an incomparably higher degree, for at
every step he runs the risk of losing his life. For what dread of want or
poverty that can reach or harass the student can compare with what the
soldier feels, who finds himself beleaguered in some stronghold mounting
guard in some ravelin or cavalier, knows that the enemy is pushing a mine
towards the post where he is stationed, and cannot under any circumstances
retire or fly from the imminent danger that threatens him? All he can do
is to inform his captain of what is going on so that he may try to remedy
it by a counter-mine, and then stand his ground in fear and expectation of
the moment when he will fly up to the clouds without wings and descend
into the deep against his will. And if this seems a trifling risk, let us
see whether it is equalled or surpassed by the encounter of two galleys
stem to stem, in the midst of the open sea, locked and entangled one with
the other, when the soldier has no more standing room than two feet of the
plank of the spur; and yet, though he sees before him threatening him as
many ministers of death as there are cannon of the foe pointed at him, not
a lance length from his body, and sees too that with the first heedless
step he will go down to visit the profundities of Neptune’s bosom, still
with dauntless heart, urged on by honour that nerves him, he makes himself
a target for all that musketry, and struggles to cross that narrow path to
the enemy’s ship. And what is still more marvellous, no sooner has one
gone down into the depths he will never rise from till the end of the
world, than another takes his place; and if he too falls into the sea that
waits for him like an enemy, another and another will succeed him without
a moment’s pause between their deaths: courage and daring the greatest
that all the chances of war can show. Happy the blest ages that knew not
the dread fury of those devilish engines of artillery, whose inventor I am
persuaded is in hell receiving the reward of his diabolical invention, by
which he made it easy for a base and cowardly arm to take the life of a
gallant gentleman; and that, when he knows not how or whence, in the
height of the ardour and enthusiasm that fire and animate brave hearts,
there should come some random bullet, discharged perhaps by one who fled
in terror at the flash when he fired off his accursed machine, which in an
instant puts an end to the projects and cuts off the life of one who
deserved to live for ages to come. And thus when I reflect on this, I am
almost tempted to say that in my heart I repent of having adopted this
profession of knight-errant in so detestable an age as we live in now; for
though no peril can make me fear, still it gives me some uneasiness to
think that powder and lead may rob me of the opportunity of making myself
famous and renowned throughout the known earth by the might of my arm and
the edge of my sword. But Heaven’s will be done; if I succeed in my
attempt I shall be all the more honoured, as I have faced greater dangers
than the knights-errant of yore exposed themselves to.”
</p>
<p>
All this lengthy discourse Don Quixote delivered while the others supped,
forgetting to raise a morsel to his lips, though Sancho more than once
told him to eat his supper, as he would have time enough afterwards to say
all he wanted. It excited fresh pity in those who had heard him to see a
man of apparently sound sense, and with rational views on every subject he
discussed, so hopelessly wanting in all, when his wretched unlucky
chivalry was in question. The curate told him he was quite right in all he
had said in favour of arms, and that he himself, though a man of letters
and a graduate, was of the same opinion.
</p>
<p>
They finished their supper, the cloth was removed, and while the hostess, her
daughter, and Maritornes were getting Don Quixote of La Mancha’s garret
ready, in which it was arranged that the women were to be quartered by
themselves for the night, Don Fernando begged the captive to tell them the
story of his life, for it could not fail to be strange and interesting, to
judge by the hints he had let fall on his arrival in company with Zoraida. To
this the captive replied that he would very willingly yield to his request,
only he feared his tale would not give them as much pleasure as he wished;
nevertheless, not to be wanting in compliance, he would tell it. The curate and
the others thanked him and added their entreaties, and he finding himself so
pressed said there was no occasion to ask, where a command had such weight, and
added, “If your worships will give me your attention you will hear a true
story which, perhaps, fictitious ones constructed with ingenious and studied
art cannot come up to.” These words made them settle themselves in their
places and preserve a deep silence, and he seeing them waiting on his words in
mute expectation, began thus in a pleasant quiet voice.

</p>
<p>
My family had its origin in a village in the mountains of Leon, and nature
had been kinder and more generous to it than fortune; though in the
general poverty of those communities my father passed for being even a
rich man; and he would have been so in reality had he been as clever in
preserving his property as he was in spending it. This tendency of his to
be liberal and profuse he had acquired from having been a soldier in his
youth, for the soldier’s life is a school in which the niggard becomes
free-handed and the free-handed prodigal; and if any soldiers are to be
found who are misers, they are monsters of rare occurrence. My father went
beyond liberality and bordered on prodigality, a disposition by no means
advantageous to a married man who has children to succeed to his name and
position. My father had three, all sons, and all of sufficient age to make
choice of a profession. Finding, then, that he was unable to resist his
propensity, he resolved to divest himself of the instrument and cause of
his prodigality and lavishness, to divest himself of wealth, without which
Alexander himself would have seemed parsimonious; and so calling us all
three aside one day into a room, he addressed us in words somewhat to the
following effect:
</p>
<p>
“My sons, to assure you that I love you, no more need be known or said
than that you are my sons; and to encourage a suspicion that I do not love
you, no more is needed than the knowledge that I have no self-control as
far as preservation of your patrimony is concerned; therefore, that you
may for the future feel sure that I love you like a father, and have no
wish to ruin you like a stepfather, I propose to do with you what I have
for some time back meditated, and after mature deliberation decided upon.
You are now of an age to choose your line of life or at least make choice
of a calling that will bring you honour and profit when you are older; and
what I have resolved to do is to divide my property into four parts; three
I will give to you, to each his portion without making any difference, and
the other I will retain to live upon and support myself for whatever
remainder of life Heaven may be pleased to grant me. But I wish each of
you on taking possession of the share that falls to him to follow one of
the paths I shall indicate. In this Spain of ours there is a proverb, to
my mind very true—as they all are, being short aphorisms drawn from
long practical experience—and the one I refer to says, ‘The church,
or the sea, or the king’s house;’ as much as to say, in plainer language,
whoever wants to flourish and become rich, let him follow the church, or
go to sea, adopting commerce as his calling, or go into the king’s service
in his household, for they say, ‘Better a king’s crumb than a lord’s
favour.’ I say so because it is my will and pleasure that one of you
should follow letters, another trade, and the third serve the king in the
wars, for it is a difficult matter to gain admission to his service in his
household, and if war does not bring much wealth it confers great
distinction and fame. Eight days hence I will give you your full shares in
money, without defrauding you of a farthing, as you will see in the end.
Now tell me if you are willing to follow out my idea and advice as I have
laid it before you.”
</p>
<p>
Having called upon me as the eldest to answer, I, after urging him not to
strip himself of his property but to spend it all as he pleased, for we
were young men able to gain our living, consented to comply with his
wishes, and said that mine were to follow the profession of arms and
thereby serve God and my king. My second brother having made the same
proposal, decided upon going to the Indies, embarking the portion that
fell to him in trade. The youngest, and in my opinion the wisest, said he
would rather follow the church, or go to complete his studies at
Salamanca. As soon as we had come to an understanding, and made choice of
our professions, my father embraced us all, and in the short time he
mentioned carried into effect all he had promised; and when he had given
to each his share, which as well as I remember was three thousand ducats
apiece in cash (for an uncle of ours bought the estate and paid for it
down, not to let it go out of the family), we all three on the same day
took leave of our good father; and at the same time, as it seemed to me
inhuman to leave my father with such scanty means in his old age, I
induced him to take two of my three thousand ducats, as the remainder
would be enough to provide me with all a soldier needed. My two brothers,
moved by my example, gave him each a thousand ducats, so that there was
left for my father four thousand ducats in money, besides three thousand,
the value of the portion that fell to him which he preferred to retain in
land instead of selling it. Finally, as I said, we took leave of him, and
of our uncle whom I have mentioned, not without sorrow and tears on both
sides, they charging us to let them know whenever an opportunity offered
how we fared, whether well or ill. We promised to do so, and when he had
embraced us and given us his blessing, one set out for Salamanca, the
other for Seville, and I for Alicante, where I had heard there was a
Genoese vessel taking in a cargo of wool for Genoa.
</p>
<p>
It is now some twenty-two years since I left my father’s house, and all
that time, though I have written several letters, I have had no news whatever
of him or of my brothers; my own adventures during that period I will now
relate briefly. I embarked at Alicante, reached Genoa after a prosperous
voyage, and proceeded thence to Milan, where I provided myself with arms and a
few soldier’s accoutrements; thence it was my intention to go and take
service in Piedmont, but as I was already on the road to Alessandria della
Paglia, I learned that the great Duke of Alva was on his way to Flanders. I
changed my plans, joined him, served under him in the campaigns he made, was
present at the deaths of the Counts Egmont and Horn, and was promoted to be
ensign under a famous captain of Guadalajara, Diego de Urbina by name. Some
time after my arrival in Flanders news came of the league that his Holiness
Pope Pius V. of happy memory, had made with Venice and Spain against the common
enemy, the Turk, who had just then with his fleet taken the famous island of
Cyprus, which belonged to the Venetians, a loss deplorable and disastrous. It
was known as a fact that the Most Serene Don John of Austria, natural brother
of our good king Don Philip, was coming as commander-in-chief of the allied
forces, and rumours were abroad of the vast warlike preparations which were
being made, all which stirred my heart and filled me with a longing to take
part in the campaign which was expected; and though I had reason to believe,
and almost certain promises, that on the first opportunity that presented
itself I should be promoted to be captain, I preferred to leave all and betake
myself, as I did, to Italy; and it was my good fortune that Don John had just
arrived at Genoa, and was going on to Naples to join the Venetian fleet, as he
afterwards did at Messina. I may say, in short, that I took part in that
glorious expedition, promoted by this time to be a captain of infantry, to
which honourable charge my good luck rather than my merits raised me; and that
day—so fortunate for Christendom, because then all the nations of the
earth were disabused of the error under which they lay in imagining the Turks
to be invincible on sea—on that day, I say, on which the Ottoman pride
and arrogance were broken, among all that were there made happy (for the
Christians who died that day were happier than those who remained alive and
victorious) I alone was miserable; for, instead of some naval crown that I
might have expected had it been in Roman times, on the night that followed that
famous day I found myself with fetters on my feet and manacles on my hands.
</p>
<p>
It happened in this way: El Uchali, the king of Algiers, a daring and
successful corsair, having attacked and taken the leading Maltese galley
(only three knights being left alive in it, and they badly wounded), the
chief galley of John Andrea, on board of which I and my company were
placed, came to its relief, and doing as was bound to do in such a case, I
leaped on board the enemy’s galley, which, sheering off from that which
had attacked it, prevented my men from following me, and so I found myself
alone in the midst of my enemies, who were in such numbers that I was
unable to resist; in short I was taken, covered with wounds; El Uchali, as
you know, sirs, made his escape with his entire squadron, and I was left a
prisoner in his power, the only sad being among so many filled with joy,
and the only captive among so many free; for there were fifteen thousand
Christians, all at the oar in the Turkish fleet, that regained their
longed-for liberty that day.
</p>
<p>
They carried me to Constantinople, where the Grand Turk, Selim, made my
master general at sea for having done his duty in the battle and carried
off as evidence of his bravery the standard of the Order of Malta. The
following year, which was the year seventy-two, I found myself at Navarino
rowing in the leading galley with the three lanterns. There I saw and
observed how the opportunity of capturing the whole Turkish fleet in
harbour was lost; for all the marines and janizzaries that belonged to it
made sure that they were about to be attacked inside the very harbour, and
had their kits and pasamaques, or shoes, ready to flee at once on shore
without waiting to be assailed, in so great fear did they stand of our
fleet. But Heaven ordered it otherwise, not for any fault or neglect of
the general who commanded on our side, but for the sins of Christendom,
and because it was God’s will and pleasure that we should always have
instruments of punishment to chastise us. As it was, El Uchali took refuge
at Modon, which is an island near Navarino, and landing forces fortified
the mouth of the harbour and waited quietly until Don John retired. On
this expedition was taken the galley called the Prize, whose captain was a
son of the famous corsair Barbarossa. It was taken by the chief Neapolitan
galley called the She-wolf, commanded by that thunderbolt of war, that
father of his men, that successful and unconquered captain Don Álvaro de
Bazan, Marquis of Santa Cruz; and I cannot help telling you what took
place at the capture of the Prize.
</p>
<p>
The son of Barbarossa was so cruel, and treated his slaves so badly, that,
when those who were at the oars saw that the She-wolf galley was bearing
down upon them and gaining upon them, they all at once dropped their oars
and seized their captain who stood on the stage at the end of the gangway
shouting to them to row lustily; and passing him on from bench to bench,
from the poop to the prow, they so bit him that before he had got much
past the mast his soul had already got to hell; so great, as I said, was
the cruelty with which he treated them, and the hatred with which they
hated him.
</p>
<p>
We returned to Constantinople, and the following year, seventy-three, it
became known that Don John had seized Tunis and taken the kingdom from the
Turks, and placed Muley Hamet in possession, putting an end to the hopes
which Muley Hamida, the cruelest and bravest Moor in the world,
entertained of returning to reign there. The Grand Turk took the loss
greatly to heart, and with the cunning which all his race possess, he made
peace with the Venetians (who were much more eager for it than he was),
and the following year, seventy-four, he attacked the Goletta and the fort
which Don John had left half built near Tunis. While all these events were
occurring, I was labouring at the oar without any hope of freedom; at
least I had no hope of obtaining it by ransom, for I was firmly resolved
not to write to my father telling him of my misfortunes. At length the
Goletta fell, and the fort fell, before which places there were
seventy-five thousand regular Turkish soldiers, and more than four hundred
thousand Moors and Arabs from all parts of Africa, and in the train of all
this great host such munitions and engines of war, and so many pioneers
that with their hands they might have covered the Goletta and the fort
with handfuls of earth. The first to fall was the Goletta, until then
reckoned impregnable, and it fell, not by any fault of its defenders, who
did all that they could and should have done, but because experiment
proved how easily entrenchments could be made in the desert sand there;
for water used to be found at two palms depth, while the Turks found none
at two yards; and so by means of a quantity of sandbags they raised their
works so high that they commanded the walls of the fort, sweeping them as
if from a cavalier, so that no one was able to make a stand or maintain
the defence.
</p>
<p>
It was a common opinion that our men should not have shut themselves up in
the Goletta, but should have waited in the open at the landing-place; but
those who say so talk at random and with little knowledge of such matters;
for if in the Goletta and in the fort there were barely seven thousand
soldiers, how could such a small number, however resolute, sally out and
hold their own against numbers like those of the enemy? And how is it
possible to help losing a stronghold that is not relieved, above all when
surrounded by a host of determined enemies in their own country? But many
thought, and I thought so too, that it was special favour and mercy which
Heaven showed to Spain in permitting the destruction of that source and
hiding place of mischief, that devourer, sponge, and moth of countless
money, fruitlessly wasted there to no other purpose save preserving the
memory of its capture by the invincible Charles V.; as if to make that
eternal, as it is and will be, these stones were needed to support it. The
fort also fell; but the Turks had to win it inch by inch, for the soldiers
who defended it fought so gallantly and stoutly that the number of the
enemy killed in twenty-two general assaults exceeded twenty-five thousand.
Of three hundred that remained alive not one was taken unwounded, a clear
and manifest proof of their gallantry and resolution, and how sturdily
they had defended themselves and held their post. A small fort or tower
which was in the middle of the lagoon under the command of Don Juan
Zanoguera, a Valencian gentleman and a famous soldier, capitulated upon
terms. They took prisoner Don Pedro Puertocarrero, commandant of the
Goletta, who had done all in his power to defend his fortress, and took
the loss of it so much to heart that he died of grief on the way to
Constantinople, where they were carrying him a prisoner. They also took
the commandant of the fort, Gabrio Cerbellon by name, a Milanese
gentleman, a great engineer and a very brave soldier. In these two
fortresses perished many persons of note, among whom was Pagano Doria,
knight of the Order of St. John, a man of generous disposition, as was
shown by his extreme liberality to his brother, the famous John Andrea
Doria; and what made his death the more sad was that he was slain by some
Arabs to whom, seeing that the fort was now lost, he entrusted himself,
and who offered to conduct him in the disguise of a Moor to Tabarca, a
small fort or station on the coast held by the Genoese employed in the
coral fishery. These Arabs cut off his head and carried it to the
commander of the Turkish fleet, who proved on them the truth of our
Castilian proverb, that “though the treason may please, the traitor is
hated;” for they say he ordered those who brought him the present to be
hanged for not having brought him alive.

<br><br><br>
</p>
<p>
Among the Christians who were taken in the fort was one named Don Pedro de
Aguilar, a native of some place, I know not what, in Andalusia, who had
been ensign in the fort, a soldier of great repute and rare intelligence,
who had in particular a special gift for what they call poetry. I say so
because his fate brought him to my galley and to my bench, and made him a
slave to the same master; and before we left the port this gentleman
composed two sonnets by way of epitaphs, one on the Goletta and the other
on the fort; indeed, I may as well repeat them, for I have them by heart,
and I think they will be liked rather than disliked.
</p>
<p>
The instant the captive mentioned the name of Don Pedro de Aguilar, Don
Fernando looked at his companions and they all three smiled; and when he
came to speak of the sonnets one of them said, “Before your worship
proceeds any further I entreat you to tell me what became of that Don
Pedro de Aguilar you have spoken of.”
</p>
<p>
“All I know is,” replied the captive, “that after having been in
Constantinople two years, he escaped in the disguise of an Arnaut, in
company with a Greek spy; but whether he regained his liberty or not I
cannot tell, though I fancy he did, because a year afterwards I saw the
Greek at Constantinople, though I was unable to ask him what the result of
the journey was.”
</p>
<p>
“Well then, you are right,” returned the gentleman, “for that Don Pedro is
my brother, and he is now in our village in good health, rich, married,
and with three children.”
</p>
<p>
“Thanks be to God for all the mercies he has shown him,” said the captive;
“for to my mind there is no happiness on earth to compare with recovering
lost liberty.”
</p>
<p>
“And what is more,” said the gentleman, “I know the sonnets my brother
made.”
</p>
<p>
“Then let your worship repeat them,” said the captive, “for you will
recite them better than I can.”
</p>
<p>
“With all my heart,” said the gentleman; “that on the Goletta runs thus.”

Wearied and few the last defenders fell.<br>
And this same arid soil hath ever been<br>
A haunt of countless mournful memories,<br>
As well in our day as in days of yore.<br>
But never yet to Heaven it sent, I ween,<br>
From its hard bosom purer souls than these,<br>
Or braver bodies on its surface bore.”<br>
</p>
<p>
The sonnets were not disliked, and the captive was rejoiced at the tidings
they gave him of his comrade, and continuing his tale, he went on to say:
</p>
<p>
The Goletta and the fort being thus in their hands, the Turks gave orders
to dismantle the Goletta—for the fort was reduced to such a state
that there was nothing left to level—and to do the work more quickly
and easily they mined it in three places; but nowhere were they able to
blow up the part which seemed to be the least strong, that is to say, the
old walls, while all that remained standing of the new fortifications that
the Fratin had made came to the ground with the greatest ease. Finally the
fleet returned victorious and triumphant to Constantinople, and a few
months later died my master, El Uchali, otherwise Uchali Fartax, which
means in Turkish “the scabby renegade;” for that he was; it is the
practice with the Turks to name people from some defect or virtue they may
possess; the reason being that there are among them only four surnames
belonging to families tracing their descent from the Ottoman house, and
the others, as I have said, take their names and surnames either from
bodily blemishes or moral qualities. This “scabby one” rowed at the oar as
a slave of the Grand Signor’s for fourteen years, and when over
thirty-four years of age, in resentment at having been struck by a Turk
while at the oar, turned renegade and renounced his faith in order to be
able to revenge himself; and such was his valour that, without owing his
advancement to the base ways and means by which most favourites of the
Grand Signor rise to power, he came to be king of Algiers, and afterwards
general-on-sea, which is the third place of trust in the realm. He was a
Calabrian by birth, and a worthy man morally, and he treated his slaves
with great humanity. He had three thousand of them, and after his death
they were divided, as he directed by his will, between the Grand Signor
(who is heir of all who die and shares with the children of the deceased)
and his renegades. I fell to the lot of a Venetian renegade who, when a
cabin boy on board a ship, had been taken by Uchali and was so much
beloved by him that he became one of his most favoured youths. He came to
be the most cruel renegade I ever saw: his name was Hassan Aga, and he
grew very rich and became king of Algiers. With him I went there from
Constantinople, rather glad to be so near Spain, not that I intended to
write to anyone about my unhappy lot, but to try if fortune would be
kinder to me in Algiers than in Constantinople, where I had attempted in a
thousand ways to escape without ever finding a favourable time or chance;
but in Algiers I resolved to seek for other means of effecting the purpose
I cherished so dearly; for the hope of obtaining my liberty never deserted
me; and when in my plots and schemes and attempts the result did not
answer my expectations, without giving way to despair I immediately began
to look out for or conjure up some new hope to support me, however faint
or feeble it might be.
</p>
<p>
In this way I lived on immured in a building or prison called by the Turks
a baño in which they confine the Christian captives, as well those that
are the king’s as those belonging to private individuals, and also what
they call those of the Almacen, which is as much as to say the slaves of
the municipality, who serve the city in the public works and other
employments; but captives of this kind recover their liberty with great
difficulty, for, as they are public property and have no particular
master, there is no one with whom to treat for their ransom, even though
they may have the means. To these baños, as I have said, some private
individuals of the town are in the habit of bringing their captives,
especially when they are to be ransomed; because there they can keep them
in safety and comfort until their ransom arrives. The king’s captives
also, that are on ransom, do not go out to work with the rest of the crew,
unless when their ransom is delayed; for then, to make them write for it
more pressingly, they compel them to work and go for wood, which is no
light labour.
</p>
<p>
I, however, was one of those on ransom, for when it was discovered that I
was a captain, although I declared my scanty means and want of fortune,
nothing could dissuade them from including me among the gentlemen and
those waiting to be ransomed. They put a chain on me, more as a mark of
this than to keep me safe, and so I passed my life in that baño with
several other gentlemen and persons of quality marked out as held to
ransom; but though at times, or rather almost always, we suffered from
hunger and scanty clothing, nothing distressed us so much as hearing and
seeing at every turn the unexampled and unheard-of cruelties my master
inflicted upon the Christians. Every day he hanged a man, impaled one, cut
off the ears of another; and all with so little provocation, or so
entirely without any, that the Turks acknowledged he did it merely for the
sake of doing it, and because he was by nature murderously disposed
towards the whole human race. The only one that fared at all well with him
was a Spanish soldier, something de Saavedra by name, to whom he never
gave a blow himself, or ordered a blow to be given, or addressed a hard
word, although he had done things that will dwell in the memory of the
people there for many a year, and all to recover his liberty; and for the
least of the many things he did we all dreaded that he would be impaled,
and he himself was in fear of it more than once; and only that time does
not allow, I could tell you now something of what that soldier did, that
would interest and astonish you much more than the narration of my own
tale.
</p>
<p>
To go on with my story; the courtyard of our prison was overlooked by the
windows of the house belonging to a wealthy Moor of high position; and
these, as is usual in Moorish houses, were rather loopholes than windows,
and besides were covered with thick and close lattice-work. It so
happened, then, that as I was one day on the terrace of our prison with
three other comrades, trying, to pass away the time, how far we could leap
with our chains, we being alone, for all the other Christians had gone out
to work, I chanced to raise my eyes, and from one of these little closed
windows I saw a reed appear with a cloth attached to the end of it, and it
kept waving to and fro, and moving as if making signs to us to come and
take it. We watched it, and one of those who were with me went and stood
under the reed to see whether they would let it drop, or what they would
do, but as he did so the reed was raised and moved from side to side, as
if they meant to say “no” by a shake of the head. The Christian came back,
and it was again lowered, making the same movements as before. Another of
my comrades went, and with him the same happened as with the first, and
then the third went forward, but with the same result as the first and
second. Seeing this I did not like not to try my luck, and as soon as I
came under the reed it was dropped and fell inside the baño at my feet. I
hastened to untie the cloth, in which I perceived a knot, and in this were
ten cianis, which are coins of base gold, current among the Moors, and
each worth ten reals of our money.
</p>
<p>
It is needless to say I rejoiced over this godsend, and my joy was not
less than my wonder as I strove to imagine how this good fortune could
have come to us, but to me specially; for the evident unwillingness to
drop the reed for any but me showed that it was for me the favour was
intended. I took my welcome money, broke the reed, and returned to the
terrace, and looking up at the window, I saw a very white hand put out
that opened and shut very quickly. From this we gathered or fancied that
it must be some woman living in that house that had done us this kindness,
and to show that we were grateful for it, we made salaams after the
fashion of the Moors, bowing the head, bending the body, and crossing the
arms on the breast. Shortly afterwards at the same window a small cross
made of reeds was put out and immediately withdrawn. This sign led us to
believe that some Christian woman was a captive in the house, and that it
was she who had been so good to us; but the whiteness of the hand and the
bracelets we had perceived made us dismiss that idea, though we thought it
might be one of the Christian renegades whom their masters very often take
as lawful wives, and gladly, for they prefer them to the women of their
own nation. In all our conjectures we were wide of the truth; so from that
time forward our sole occupation was watching and gazing at the window
where the cross had appeared to us, as if it were our pole-star; but at
least fifteen days passed without our seeing either it or the hand, or any
other sign and though meanwhile we endeavoured with the utmost pains to
ascertain who it was that lived in the house, and whether there were any
Christian renegade in it, nobody could ever tell us anything more than
that he who lived there was a rich Moor of high position, Hadji Morato by
name, formerly alcaide of La Pata, an office of high dignity among them.
But when we least thought it was going to rain any more cianis from that
quarter, we saw the reed suddenly appear with another cloth tied in a
larger knot attached to it, and this at a time when, as on the former
occasion, the baño was deserted and unoccupied.
</p>

<br><br><br>
</p>
<p>
We made trial as before, each of the same three going forward before I
did; but the reed was delivered to none but me, and on my approach it was
let drop. I untied the knot and I found forty Spanish gold crowns with a
paper written in Arabic, and at the end of the writing there was a large
cross drawn. I kissed the cross, took the crowns and returned to the
terrace, and we all made our salaams; again the hand appeared, I made
signs that I would read the paper, and then the window was closed. We were
all puzzled, though filled with joy at what had taken place; and as none
of us understood Arabic, great was our curiosity to know what the paper
contained, and still greater the difficulty of finding someone to read
it. At last I resolved to confide in a renegade, a native of Murcia, who
professed a very great friendship for me, and had given pledges that bound
him to keep any secret I might entrust to him; for it is the custom with
some renegades, when they intend to return to Christian territory, to
carry about them certificates from captives of mark testifying, in
whatever form they can, that such and such a renegade is a worthy man who
has always shown kindness to Christians, and is anxious to escape on the
first opportunity that may present itself. Some obtain these testimonials
with good intentions, others put them to a cunning use; for when they go
to pillage on Christian territory, if they chance to be cast away, or
taken prisoners, they produce their certificates and say that from these
papers may be seen the object they came for, which was to remain on
Christian ground, and that it was to this end they joined the Turks in
their foray. In this way they escape the consequences of the first
outburst and make their peace with the Church before it does them any
harm, and then when they have the chance they return to Barbary to become
what they were before. Others, however, there are who procure these papers
and make use of them honestly, and remain on Christian soil. This friend
of mine, then, was one of these renegades that I have described; he had
certificates from all our comrades, in which we testified in his favour as
strongly as we could; and if the Moors had found the papers they would
have burned him alive.
</p>
<p>
I knew that he understood Arabic very well, and could not only speak but
also write it; but before I disclosed the whole matter to him, I asked him
to read for me this paper which I had found by accident in a hole in my
cell. He opened it and remained some time examining it and muttering to
himself as he translated it. I asked him if he understood it, and he told
me he did perfectly well, and that if I wished him to tell me its meaning
word for word, I must give him pen and ink that he might do it more
satisfactorily. We at once gave him what he required, and he set about
translating it bit by bit, and when he had done he said:
</p>
<p>
“All that is here in Spanish is what the Moorish paper contains, and you
must bear in mind that when it says ‘Lela Marien’ it means ‘Our Lady the
Virgin Mary.’”
</p>
<p>
We read the paper and it ran thus:
</p>
<p>
“When I was a child my father had a slave who taught me to pray the
Christian prayer in my own language, and told me many things about Lela
Marien. The Christian died, and I know that she did not go to the fire,
but to Allah, because since then I have seen her twice, and she told me to
go to the land of the Christians to see Lela Marien, who had great love
for me. I know not how to go. I have seen many Christians, but except
thyself none has seemed to me to be a gentleman. I am young and beautiful,
and have plenty of money to take with me. See if thou canst contrive how
we may go, and if thou wilt thou shalt be my husband there, and if thou
wilt not it will not distress me, for Lela Marien will find me someone to
marry me. I myself have written this: have a care to whom thou givest it
to read: trust no Moor, for they are all perfidious. I am greatly troubled
on this account, for I would not have thee confide in anyone, because if
my father knew it he would at once fling me down a well and cover me with
stones. I will put a thread to the reed; tie the answer to it, and if thou
hast no one to write for thee in Arabic, tell it to me by signs, for Lela
Marien will make me understand thee. She and Allah and this cross, which I
often kiss as the captive bade me, protect thee.”
</p>
<p>
Judge, sirs, whether we had reason for surprise and joy at the words of
this paper; and both one and the other were so great, that the renegade
perceived that the paper had not been found by chance, but had been in
reality addressed to someone of us, and he begged us, if what he
suspected were the truth, to trust him and tell him all, for he would risk
his life for our freedom; and so saying he took out from his breast a
metal crucifix, and with many tears swore by the God the image
represented, in whom, sinful and wicked as he was, he truly and faithfully
believed, to be loyal to us and keep secret whatever we chose to reveal to
him; for he thought and almost foresaw that by means of her who had
written that paper, he and all of us would obtain our liberty, and he
himself obtain the object he so much desired, his restoration to the bosom
of the Holy Mother Church, from which by his own sin and ignorance he was
now severed like a corrupt limb. The renegade said this with so many tears
and such signs of repentance, that with one consent we all agreed to tell
him the whole truth of the matter, and so we gave him a full account of
all, without hiding anything from him. We pointed out to him the window at
which the reed appeared, and he by that means took note of the house, and
resolved to ascertain with particular care who lived in it. We agreed also
that it would be advisable to answer the Moorish lady’s letter, and the
renegade without a moment’s delay took down the words I dictated to him,
which were exactly what I shall tell you, for nothing of importance that
took place in this affair has escaped my memory, or ever will while life
lasts. This, then, was the answer returned to the Moorish lady:
</p>
<p>
“The true Allah protect thee, Lady, and that blessed Marien who is the
true mother of God, and who has put it into thy heart to go to the land of
the Christians, because she loves thee. Entreat her that she be pleased to
show thee how thou canst execute the command she gives thee, for she will,
such is her goodness. On my own part, and on that of all these Christians
who are with me, I promise to do all that we can for thee, even to death.
Fail not to write to me and inform me what thou dost mean to do, and I
will always answer thee; for the great Allah has given us a Christian
captive who can speak and write thy language well, as thou mayest see by
this paper; without fear, therefore, thou canst inform us of all thou
wouldst. As to what thou sayest, that if thou dost reach the land of the
Christians thou wilt be my wife, I give thee my promise upon it as a good
Christian; and know that the Christians keep their promises better than
the Moors. Allah and Marien his mother watch over thee, my Lady.”
</p>
<p>
The paper being written and folded I waited two days until the baño was
empty as before, and immediately repaired to the usual walk on the terrace
to see if there were any sign of the reed, which was not long in making
its appearance. As soon as I saw it, although I could not distinguish who
put it out, I showed the paper as a sign to attach the thread, but it was
already fixed to the reed, and to it I tied the paper; and shortly
afterwards our star once more made its appearance with the white flag of
peace, the little bundle. It was dropped, and I picked it up, and found in
the cloth, in gold and silver coins of all sorts, more than fifty crowns,
which fifty times more strengthened our joy and doubled our hope of
gaining our liberty. That very night our renegade returned and said he had
learned that the Moor we had been told of lived in that house, that his
name was Hadji Morato, that he was enormously rich, that he had one only
daughter the heiress of all his wealth, and that it was the general
opinion throughout the city that she was the most beautiful woman in
Barbary, and that several of the viceroys who came there had sought her
for a wife, but that she had been always unwilling to marry; and he had
learned, moreover, that she had a Christian slave who was now dead; all
which agreed with the contents of the paper. We immediately took counsel
with the renegade as to what means would have to be adopted in order to
carry off the Moorish lady and bring us all to Christian territory; and in
the end it was agreed that for the present we should wait for a second
communication from Zoraida (for that was the name of her who now desires
to be called Maria), because we saw clearly that she and no one else could
find a way out of all these difficulties. When we had decided upon this
the renegade told us not to be uneasy, for he would lose his life or
restore us to liberty. For four days the baño was filled with people, for
which reason the reed delayed its appearance for four days, but at the end
of that time, when the baño was, as it generally was, empty, it appeared
with the cloth so bulky that it promised a happy birth. Reed and cloth
came down to me, and I found another paper and a hundred crowns in gold,
without any other coin. The renegade was present, and in our cell we gave
him the paper to read, which was to this effect:
</p>
<p>
“I cannot think of a plan, señor, for our going to Spain, nor has Lela
Marien shown me one, though I have asked her. All that can be done is for
me to give you plenty of money in gold from this window. With it ransom
yourself and your friends, and let one of you go to the land of the
Christians, and there buy a vessel and come back for the others; and he
will find me in my father’s garden, which is at the Babazon gate near the
seashore, where I shall be all this summer with my father and my servants.
You can carry me away from there by night without any danger, and bring me
to the vessel. And remember thou art to be my husband, else I will pray to
Marien to punish thee. If thou canst not trust anyone to go for the
vessel, ransom thyself and do thou go, for I know thou wilt return more
surely than any other, as thou art a gentleman and a Christian. Endeavour
to make thyself acquainted with the garden; and when I see thee walking
yonder I shall know that the baño is empty and I will give thee abundance
of money. Allah protect thee, señor.”
</p>
<p>
These were the words and contents of the second paper, and on hearing
them, each declared himself willing to be the ransomed one, and promised
to go and return with scrupulous good faith; and I too made the same
offer; but to all this the renegade objected, saying that he would not on
any account consent to one being set free before all went together, as
experience had taught him how ill those who have been set free keep
promises which they made in captivity; for captives of distinction
frequently had recourse to this plan, paying the ransom of one who was to
go to Valencia or Majorca with money to enable him to arm a bark and
return for the others who had ransomed him, but who never came back; for
recovered liberty and the dread of losing it again efface from the memory
all the obligations in the world. And to prove the truth of what he said,
he told us briefly what had happened to a certain Christian gentleman
almost at that very time, the strangest case that had ever occurred even
there, where astonishing and marvellous things are happening every
instant. In short, he ended by saying that what could and ought to be done
was to give the money intended for the ransom of one of us Christians to
him, so that he might with it buy a vessel there in Algiers under the
pretence of becoming a merchant and trader at Tetuan and along the coast;
and when master of the vessel, it would be easy for him to hit on some way
of getting us all out of the baño and putting us on board; especially if
the Moorish lady gave, as she said, money enough to ransom all, because
once free it would be the easiest thing in the world for us to embark even
in open day; but the greatest difficulty was that the Moors do not allow
any renegade to buy or own any craft, unless it be a large vessel for
going on roving expeditions, because they are afraid that anyone who buys
a small vessel, especially if he be a Spaniard, only wants it for the
purpose of escaping to Christian territory. This however he could get over
by arranging with a Tagarin Moor to go shares with him in the purchase of
the vessel, and in the profit on the cargo; and under cover of this he
could become master of the vessel, in which case he looked upon all the
rest as accomplished. But though to me and my comrades it had seemed a
better plan to send to Majorca for the vessel, as the Moorish lady
suggested, we did not dare to oppose him, fearing that if we did not do as
he said he would denounce us, and place us in danger of losing all our
lives if he were to disclose our dealings with Zoraida, for whose life we
would have all given our own. We therefore resolved to put ourselves in
the hands of God and in the renegade’s; and at the same time an answer was
given to Zoraida, telling her that we would do all she recommended, for
she had given as good advice as if Lela Marien had delivered it, and that
it depended on her alone whether we were to defer the business or put it
in execution at once. I renewed my promise to be her husband; and thus the
next day that the baño chanced to be empty she at different times gave us
by means of the reed and cloth two thousand gold crowns and a paper in
which she said that the next Juma, that is to say Friday, she was going to
her father’s garden, but that before she went she would give us more
money; and if it were not enough we were to let her know, as she would
give us as much as we asked, for her father had so much he would not miss
it, and besides she kept all the keys.
</p>
<p>
We at once gave the renegade five hundred crowns to buy the vessel, and
with eight hundred I ransomed myself, giving the money to a Valencian
merchant who happened to be in Algiers at the time, and who had me
released on his word, pledging it that on the arrival of the first ship
from Valencia he would pay my ransom; for if he had given the money at
once it would have made the king suspect that my ransom money had been for
a long time in Algiers, and that the merchant had for his own advantage
kept it secret. In fact my master was so difficult to deal with that I
dared not on any account pay down the money at once. The Thursday before
the Friday on which the fair Zoraida was to go to the garden she gave us a
thousand crowns more, and warned us of her departure, begging me, if I
were ransomed, to find out her father’s garden at once, and by all means
to seek an opportunity of going there to see her. I answered in a few
words that I would do so, and that she must remember to commend us to Lela
Marien with all the prayers the captive had taught her. This having been
done, steps were taken to ransom our three comrades, so as to enable them
to quit the baño, and lest, seeing me ransomed and themselves not, though
the money was forthcoming, they should make a disturbance about it and the
devil should prompt them to do something that might injure Zoraida; for
though their position might be sufficient to relieve me from this
apprehension, nevertheless I was unwilling to run any risk in the matter;
and so I had them ransomed in the same way as I was, handing over all the
money to the merchant so that he might with safety and confidence give
security; without, however, confiding our arrangement and secret to him,
which might have been dangerous.

<p>
Before fifteen days were over our renegade had already purchased an excellent
vessel with room for more than thirty persons; and to make the transaction safe
and lend a colour to it, he thought it well to make, as he did, a voyage to a
place called Shershel, twenty leagues from Algiers on the Oran side, where
there is an extensive trade in dried figs. Two or three times he made this
voyage in company with the Tagarin already mentioned. The Moors of Aragon are
called Tagarins in Barbary, and those of Granada Mudéjares; but in the Kingdom
of Fez they call the Mudéjares Elches, and they are the people the king chiefly
employs in war. To proceed: every time he passed with his vessel he anchored in
a cove that was not two crossbow shots from the garden where Zoraida was
waiting; and there the renegade, together with the two Moorish lads that rowed,
used purposely to station himself, either going through his prayers, or else
practising as a part what he meant to perform in earnest. And thus he would go
to Zoraida’s garden and ask for fruit, which her father gave him, not
knowing him; but though, as he afterwards told me, he sought to speak to
Zoraida, and tell her who he was, and that by my orders he was to take her to
the land of the Christians, so that she might feel satisfied and easy, he had
never been able to do so; for the Moorish women do not allow themselves to be
seen by any Moor or Turk, unless their husband or father bid them: with
Christian captives they permit freedom of intercourse and communication, even
more than might be considered proper. But for my part I should have been sorry
if he had spoken to her, for perhaps it might have alarmed her to find her
affairs talked of by renegades. But God, who ordered it otherwise, afforded no
opportunity for our renegade’s well-meant purpose; and he, seeing how
safely he could go to Shershel and return, and anchor when and how and where he
liked, and that the Tagarin his partner had no will but his, and that, now I
was ransomed, all we wanted was to find some Christians to row, told me to look
out for any I should be willing to take with me, over and above those who had
been ransomed, and to engage them for the next Friday, which he fixed upon for
our departure. On this I spoke to twelve Spaniards, all stout rowers, and such
as could most easily leave the city; but it was no easy matter to find so many
just then, because there were twenty ships out on a cruise and they had taken
all the rowers with them; and these would not have been found were it not that
their master remained at home that summer without going to sea in order to
finish a galliot that he had upon the stocks. To these men I said nothing more
than that the next Friday in the evening they were to come out stealthily one
by one and hang about Hadji Morato’s garden, waiting for me there until I
came. These directions I gave each one separately, with orders that if they saw
any other Christians there they were not to say anything to them except that I
had directed them to wait at that spot.
</p>
<p>
This preliminary having been settled, another still more necessary step had to
be taken, which was to let Zoraida know how matters stood that she might be
prepared and forewarned, so as not to be taken by surprise if we were suddenly
to seize upon her before she thought the Christians’ vessel could have
returned. I determined, therefore, to go to the garden and try if I could speak
to her; and the day before my departure I went there under the pretence of
gathering herbs. The first person I met was her father, who addressed me in the
language that all over Barbary and even in Constantinople is the medium between
captives and Moors, and is neither Morisco nor Castilian, nor of any other
nation, but a mixture of all languages, by means of which we can all understand
one another. In this sort of language, I say, he asked me what I wanted in his
garden, and to whom I belonged. I replied that I was a slave of the Arnaut Mami
(for I knew as a certainty that he was a very great friend of his), and that I
wanted some herbs to make a salad. He asked me then whether I were on ransom or
not, and what my master demanded for me. While these questions and answers were
proceeding, the fair Zoraida, who had already perceived me some time before,
came out of the house in the garden, and as Moorish women are by no means
particular about letting themselves be seen by Christians, or, as I have said
before, at all coy, she had no hesitation in coming to where her father stood
with me; moreover her father, seeing her approaching slowly, called to her to
come. It would be beyond my power now to describe to you the great beauty, the
high-bred air, the brilliant attire of my beloved Zoraida as she presented
herself before my eyes. I will content myself with saying that more pearls hung
from her fair neck, her ears, and her hair than she had hairs on her head. On
her ankles, which as is customary were bare, she had carcajes (for so bracelets
or anklets are called in Morisco) of the purest gold, set with so many diamonds
that she told me afterwards her father valued them at ten thousand doubloons,
and those she had on her wrists were worth as much more. The pearls were in
profusion and very fine, for the highest display and adornment of the Moorish
women is decking themselves with rich pearls and seed-pearls; and of these
there are therefore more among the Moors than among any other people.
Zoraida’s father had to the reputation of possessing a great number, and
the purest in all Algiers, and of possessing also more than two hundred
thousand Spanish crowns; and she, who is now mistress of me only, was mistress
of all this. Whether thus adorned she would have been beautiful or not, and
what she must have been in her prosperity, may be imagined from the beauty
remaining to her after so many hardships; for, as everyone knows, the beauty of
some women has its times and its seasons, and is increased or diminished by
chance causes; and naturally the emotions of the mind will heighten or impair
it, though indeed more frequently they totally destroy it. In a word she
presented herself before me that day attired with the utmost splendour, and
supremely beautiful; at any rate, she seemed to me the most beautiful object I
had ever seen; and when, besides, I thought of all I owed to her I felt as
though I had before me some heavenly being come to earth to bring me relief and
happiness.
</p>
<p>
As she approached her father told her in his own language that I was a
captive belonging to his friend the Arnaut Mami, and that I had come for
salad.
</p>
<p>
She took up the conversation, and in that mixture of tongues I have spoken
of she asked me if I was a gentleman, and why I was not ransomed.
</p>
<p>
I answered that I was already ransomed, and that by the price it might be
seen what value my master set on me, as they had given one thousand five
hundred zoltanis for me; to which she replied, “Hadst thou been my
father’s, I can tell thee, I would not have let him part with thee for
twice as much, for you Christians always tell lies about yourselves and
make yourselves out poor to cheat the Moors.”
</p>
<p>
“That may be, lady,” said I; “but indeed I dealt truthfully with my
master, as I do and mean to do with everybody in the world.”
</p>
<p>
“And when dost thou go?” said Zoraida.
</p>
<p>
“To-morrow, I think,” said I, “for there is a vessel here from France
which sails to-morrow, and I think I shall go in her.”
</p>
<p>
“Would it not be better,” said Zoraida, “to wait for the arrival of ships
from Spain and go with them and not with the French who are not your
friends?”
</p>
<p>
“No,” said I; “though if there were intelligence that a vessel were now
coming from Spain it is true I might, perhaps, wait for it; however, it is
more likely I shall depart to-morrow, for the longing I feel to return to
my country and to those I love is so great that it will not allow me to
wait for another opportunity, however more convenient, if it be delayed.”
</p>
<p>
“No doubt thou art married in thine own country,” said Zoraida, “and for
that reason thou art anxious to go and see thy wife.”
</p>
<p>
“I am not married,” I replied, “but I have given my promise to marry on my
arrival there.”
</p>
<p>
“And is the lady beautiful to whom thou hast given it?” said Zoraida.
</p>
<p>
“So beautiful,” said I, “that, to describe her worthily and tell thee the
truth, she is very like thee.”
</p>
<p>
At this her father laughed very heartily and said, “By Allah, Christian,
she must be very beautiful if she is like my daughter, who is the most
beautiful woman in all this kingdom: only look at her well and thou wilt
see I am telling the truth.”
</p>
<p>
Zoraida’s father as the better linguist helped to interpret most of these
words and phrases, for though she spoke the bastard language, that, as I
have said, is employed there, she expressed her meaning more by signs than
by words.

While we were still engaged in this conversation, a Moor came running up,
exclaiming that four Turks had leaped over the fence or wall of the
