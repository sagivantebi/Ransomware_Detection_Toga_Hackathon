and common to make use of wiles and stratagems to overcome the enemy, so
in the contests and rivalries of love the tricks and devices employed to
attain the desired end are justifiable, provided they be not to the
discredit or dishonour of the loved object. Quiteria belonged to Basilio
and Basilio to Quiteria by the just and beneficent disposal of heaven.
Camacho is rich, and can purchase his pleasure when, where, and as it
pleases him. Basilio has but this ewe-lamb, and no one, however powerful
he may be, shall take her from him; these two whom God hath joined man
cannot separate; and he who attempts it must first pass the point of this
lance;” and so saying he brandished it so stoutly and dexterously
that he overawed all who did not know him.
</p>
<p>
But so deep an impression had the rejection of Quiteria made on Camacho’s
mind that it banished her at once from his thoughts; and so the counsels
of the priest, who was a wise and kindly disposed man, prevailed with him,
and by their means he and his partisans were pacified and tranquillised,
and to prove it put up their swords again, inveighing against the pliancy
of Quiteria rather than the craftiness of Basilio; Camacho maintaining
that, if Quiteria as a maiden had such a love for Basilio, she would have
loved him too as a married woman, and that he ought to thank heaven more
for having taken her than for having given her.
</p>
<p>
Camacho and those of his following, therefore, being consoled and
pacified, those on Basilio’s side were appeased; and the rich
Camacho, to show that he felt no resentment for the trick, and did not
care about it, desired the festival to go on just as if he were married in
reality. Neither Basilio, however, nor his bride, nor their followers
would take any part in it, and they withdrew to Basilio’s village;
for the poor, if they are persons of virtue and good sense, have those who
follow, honour, and uphold them, just as the rich have those who flatter
and dance attendance on them. With them they carried Don Quixote,
regarding him as a man of worth and a stout one. Sancho alone had a cloud
on his soul, for he found himself debarred from waiting for Camacho’s
splendid feast and festival, which lasted until night; and thus dragged
away, he moodily followed his master, who accompanied Basilio’s
party, and left behind him the flesh-pots of Egypt; though in his heart he
took them with him, and their now nearly finished skimmings that he
carried in the bucket conjured up visions before his eyes of the glory and
abundance of the good cheer he was losing. And so, vexed and dejected
though not hungry, without dismounting from Dapple he followed in the
footsteps of Rocinante.

WHEREIN IS RELATED THE GRAND ADVENTURE OF THE CAVE OF MONTESINOS IN THE

Many and great were the attentions shown to Don Quixote by the newly
married couple, who felt themselves under an obligation to him for coming
forward in defence of their cause; and they exalted his wisdom to the same
level with his courage, rating him as a Cid in arms, and a Cicero in
eloquence. Worthy Sancho enjoyed himself for three days at the expense of
the pair, from whom they learned that the sham wound was not a scheme
arranged with the fair Quiteria, but a device of Basilio’s, who
counted on exactly the result they had seen; he confessed, it is true,
that he had confided his idea to some of his friends, so that at the
proper time they might aid him in his purpose and insure the success of
the deception.

<p>
“That,” said Don Quixote, “is not and ought not to be
called deception which aims at virtuous ends;” and the marriage of
lovers he maintained to be a most excellent end, reminding them, however,
that love has no greater enemy than hunger and constant want; for love is
all gaiety, enjoyment, and happiness, especially when the lover is in the
possession of the object of his love, and poverty and want are the
declared enemies of all these; which he said to urge Señor Basilio to
abandon the practice of those accomplishments he was skilled in, for
though they brought him fame, they brought him no money, and apply himself
to the acquisition of wealth by legitimate industry, which will never fail
those who are prudent and persevering. The poor man who is a man of honour
(if indeed a poor man can be a man of honour) has a jewel when he has a
fair wife, and if she is taken from him, his honour is taken from him and
slain. The fair woman who is a woman of honour, and whose husband is poor,
deserves to be crowned with the laurels and crowns of victory and triumph.
Beauty by itself attracts the desires of all who behold it, and the royal
eagles and birds of towering flight stoop on it as on a dainty lure; but
if beauty be accompanied by want and penury, then the ravens and the kites
and other birds of prey assail it, and she who stands firm against such
attacks well deserves to be called the crown of her husband. “Remember,
O prudent Basilio,” added Don Quixote, “it was the opinion of
a certain sage, I know not whom, that there was not more than one good
woman in the whole world; and his advice was that each one should think
and believe that this one good woman was his own wife, and in this way he
would live happy. I myself am not married, nor, so far, has it ever
entered my thoughts to be so; nevertheless I would venture to give advice
to anyone who might ask it, as to the mode in which he should seek a wife
such as he would be content to marry. The first thing I would recommend
him, would be to look to good name rather than to wealth, for a good woman
does not win a good name merely by being good, but by letting it be seen
that she is so, and open looseness and freedom do much more damage to a
woman’s honour than secret depravity. If you take a good woman into
your house it will be an easy matter to keep her good, and even to make
her still better; but if you take a bad one you will find it hard work to
mend her, for it is no very easy matter to pass from one extreme to
another. I do not say it is impossible, but I look upon it as difficult.”
</p>
<p>
Sancho, listening to all this, said to himself, “This master of
mine, when I say anything that has weight and substance, says I might take
a pulpit in hand, and go about the world preaching fine sermons; but I say
of him that, when he begins stringing maxims together and giving advice
not only might he take a pulpit in hand, but two on each finger, and go
into the market-places to his heart’s content. Devil take you for a
knight-errant, what a lot of things you know! I used to think in my heart
that the only thing he knew was what belonged to his chivalry; but there
is nothing he won’t have a finger in.”
</p>
<p>
Sancho muttered this somewhat aloud, and his master overheard him, and
asked, “What art thou muttering there, Sancho?”
</p>
<p>
“I’m not saying anything or muttering anything,” said
Sancho; “I was only saying to myself that I wish I had heard what
your worship has said just now before I married; perhaps I’d say
now, ‘The ox that’s loose licks himself well.’”
</p>
<p>
“Is thy Teresa so bad then, Sancho?”
</p>
<p>
“She is not very bad,” replied Sancho; “but she is not
very good; at least she is not as good as I could wish.”
</p>
<p>
“Thou dost wrong, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “to speak
ill of thy wife; for after all she is the mother of thy children.”
“We are quits,” returned Sancho; “for she speaks ill of
me whenever she takes it into her head, especially when she is jealous;
and Satan himself could not put up with her then.”
</p>
<p>
In fine, they remained three days with the newly married couple, by whom
they were entertained and treated like kings. Don Quixote begged the
fencing licentiate to find him a guide to show him the way to the cave of
Montesinos, as he had a great desire to enter it and see with his own eyes
if the wonderful tales that were told of it all over the country were
true. The licentiate said he would get him a cousin of his own, a famous
scholar, and one very much given to reading books of chivalry, who would
have great pleasure in conducting him to the mouth of the very cave, and
would show him the lakes of Ruidera, which were likewise famous all over
La Mancha, and even all over Spain; and he assured him he would find him
entertaining, for he was a youth who could write books good enough to be
printed and dedicated to princes. The cousin arrived at last, leading an
ass in foal, with a pack-saddle covered with a parti-coloured carpet or
sackcloth; Sancho saddled Rocinante, got Dapple ready, and stocked his
alforjas, along with which went those of the cousin, likewise well filled;
and so, commending themselves to God and bidding farewell to all, they set
out, taking the road for the famous cave of Montesinos.
</p>
<p>
On the way Don Quixote asked the cousin of what sort and character his
pursuits, avocations, and studies were, to which he replied that he was by
profession a humanist, and that his pursuits and studies were making books
for the press, all of great utility and no less entertainment to the
nation. One was called “The Book of Liveries,” in which he
described seven hundred and three liveries, with their colours, mottoes,
and ciphers, from which gentlemen of the court might pick and choose any
they fancied for festivals and revels, without having to go a-begging for
them from anyone, or puzzling their brains, as the saying is, to have them
appropriate to their objects and purposes; “for,” said he,
“I give the jealous, the rejected, the forgotten, the absent, what
will suit them, and fit them without fail. I have another book, too, which
I shall call ‘Metamorphoses, or the Spanish Ovid,’ one of rare
and original invention, for imitating Ovid in burlesque style, I show in
it who the Giralda of Seville and the Angel of the Magdalena were, what
the sewer of Vecinguerra at Cordova was, what the bulls of Guisando, the
Sierra Morena, the Leganitos and Lavapies fountains at Madrid, not
forgetting those of the Piojo, of the Cano Dorado, and of the Priora; and
all with their allegories, metaphors, and changes, so that they are
amusing, interesting, and instructive, all at once. Another book I have
which I call ‘The Supplement to Polydore Vergil,’ which treats
of the invention of things, and is a work of great erudition and research,
for I establish and elucidate elegantly some things of great importance
which Polydore omitted to mention. He forgot to tell us who was the first
man in the world that had a cold in his head, and who was the first to try
salivation for the French disease, but I give it accurately set forth, and
quote more than five-and-twenty authors in proof of it, so you may
perceive I have laboured to good purpose and that the book will be of
service to the whole world.”
</p>
<p>
Sancho, who had been very attentive to the cousin’s words, said to
him, “Tell me, señor—and God give you luck in printing your
books—can you tell me (for of course you know, as you know
everything) who was the first man that scratched his head? For to my
thinking it must have been our father Adam.”
</p>
<p>
“So it must,” replied the cousin; “for there is no doubt
but Adam had a head and hair; and being the first man in the world he
would have scratched himself sometimes.”
</p>
<p>
“So I think,” said Sancho; “but now tell me, who was the
first tumbler in the world?”
</p>
<p>
“Really, brother,” answered the cousin, “I could not at
this moment say positively without having investigated it; I will look it
up when I go back to where I have my books, and will satisfy you the next
time we meet, for this will not be the last time.”
</p>
<p>
“Look here, señor,” said Sancho, “don’t give
yourself any trouble about it, for I have just this minute hit upon what I
asked you. The first tumbler in the world, you must know, was Lucifer,
when they cast or pitched him out of heaven; for he came tumbling into the
bottomless pit.”
</p>
<p>
“You are right, friend,” said the cousin; and said Don
Quixote, “Sancho, that question and answer are not thine own; thou
hast heard them from someone else.”
</p>
<p>
“Hold your peace, señor,” said Sancho; “faith, if I take
to asking questions and answering, I’ll go on from this till
to-morrow morning. Nay! to ask foolish things and answer nonsense I needn’t
go looking for help from my neighbours.”
</p>
<p>
“Thou hast said more than thou art aware of, Sancho,” said Don
Quixote; “for there are some who weary themselves out in learning
and proving things that, after they are known and proved, are not worth a
farthing to the understanding or memory.”
</p>
<p>
In this and other pleasant conversation the day went by, and that night
they put up at a small hamlet whence it was not more than two leagues to
the cave of Montesinos, so the cousin told Don Quixote, adding, that if he
was bent upon entering it, it would be requisite for him to provide
himself with ropes, so that he might be tied and lowered into its depths.
Don Quixote said that even if it reached to the bottomless pit he meant to
see where it went to; so they bought about a hundred fathoms of rope, and
next day at two in the afternoon they arrived at the cave, the mouth of
which is spacious and wide, but full of thorn and wild-fig bushes and
brambles and briars, so thick and matted that they completely close it up
and cover it over.
</p>
<p>
On coming within sight of it the cousin, Sancho, and Don Quixote
dismounted, and the first two immediately tied the latter very firmly with
the ropes, and as they were girding and swathing him Sancho said to him,
“Mind what you are about, master mine; don’t go burying
yourself alive, or putting yourself where you’ll be like a bottle
put to cool in a well; it’s no affair or business of your worship’s
to become the explorer of this, which must be worse than a Moorish
dungeon.”
</p>
<p>
“Tie me and hold thy peace,” said Don Quixote, “for an
emprise like this, friend Sancho, was reserved for me;” and said the
guide, “I beg of you, Señor Don Quixote, to observe carefully and
examine with a hundred eyes everything that is within there; perhaps there
may be some things for me to put into my book of ‘Transformations.’”
</p>
<p>
“The drum is in hands that will know how to beat it well enough,”
said Sancho Panza.
</p>
<p>
When he had said this and finished the tying (which was not over the
armour but only over the doublet) Don Quixote observed, “It was
careless of us not to have provided ourselves with a small cattle-bell to
be tied on the rope close to me, the sound of which would show that I was
still descending and alive; but as that is out of the question now, in God’s
hand be it to guide me;” and forthwith he fell on his knees and in a
low voice offered up a prayer to heaven, imploring God to aid him and
grant him success in this to all appearance perilous and untried
adventure, and then exclaimed aloud, “O mistress of my actions and
movements, illustrious and peerless Dulcinea del Toboso, if so be the
prayers and supplications of this fortunate lover can reach thy ears, by
thy incomparable beauty I entreat thee to listen to them, for they but ask
thee not to refuse me thy favour and protection now that I stand in such
need of them. I am about to precipitate, to sink, to plunge myself into
the abyss that is here before me, only to let the world know that while
thou dost favour me there is no impossibility I will not attempt and
accomplish.” With these words he approached the cavern, and
perceived that it was impossible to let himself down or effect an entrance
except by sheer force or cleaving a passage; so drawing his sword he began
to demolish and cut away the brambles at the mouth of the cave, at the
noise of which a vast multitude of crows and choughs flew out of it so
thick and so fast that they knocked Don Quixote down; and if he had been
as much of a believer in augury as he was a Catholic Christian he would
have taken it as a bad omen and declined to bury himself in such a place.
He got up, however, and as there came no more crows, or night-birds like
the bats that flew out at the same time with the crows, the cousin and
Sancho giving him rope, he lowered himself into the depths of the dread
cavern; and as he entered it Sancho sent his blessing after him, making a
thousand crosses over him and saying, “God, and the Peña de Francia,
and the Trinity of Gaeta guide thee, flower and cream of knights-errant.
There thou goest, thou dare-devil of the earth, heart of steel, arm of
brass; once more, God guide thee and send thee back safe, sound, and
unhurt to the light of this world thou art leaving to bury thyself in the
darkness thou art seeking there;” and the cousin offered up almost
the same prayers and supplications.

</p>
<p>
Don Quixote kept calling to them to give him rope and more rope, and they
gave it out little by little, and by the time the calls, which came out of
the cave as out of a pipe, ceased to be heard they had let down the
hundred fathoms of rope. They were inclined to pull Don Quixote up again,
as they could give him no more rope; however, they waited about half an
hour, at the end of which time they began to gather in the rope again with
great ease and without feeling any weight, which made them fancy Don
Quixote was remaining below; and persuaded that it was so, Sancho wept
bitterly, and hauled away in great haste in order to settle the question.
When, however, they had come to, as it seemed, rather more than eighty
fathoms they felt a weight, at which they were greatly delighted; and at
last, at ten fathoms more, they saw Don Quixote distinctly, and Sancho
called out to him, saying, “Welcome back, señor, for we had begun to
think you were going to stop there to found a family.” But Don
Quixote answered not a word, and drawing him out entirely they perceived
he had his eyes shut and every appearance of being fast asleep.
</p>
<p>
They stretched him on the ground and untied him, but still he did not
awake; however, they rolled him back and forwards and shook and pulled him
about, so that after some time he came to himself, stretching himself just
as if he were waking up from a deep and sound sleep, and looking about him
he said, “God forgive you, friends; ye have taken me away from the
sweetest and most delightful existence and spectacle that ever human being
enjoyed or beheld. Now indeed do I know that all the pleasures of this
life pass away like a shadow and a dream, or fade like the flower of the
field. O ill-fated Montesinos! O sore-wounded Durandarte! O unhappy
Belerma! O tearful Guadiana, and ye O hapless daughters of Ruidera who
show in your waves the tears that flowed from your beauteous eyes!”

</p>
<p>
The cousin and Sancho Panza listened with deep attention to the words of
Don Quixote, who uttered them as though with immense pain he drew them up
from his very bowels. They begged of him to explain himself, and tell them
what he had seen in that hell down there.
</p>
<p>
“Hell do you call it?” said Don Quixote; “call it by no
such name, for it does not deserve it, as ye shall soon see.”
</p>
<p>
He then begged them to give him something to eat, as he was very hungry.
They spread the cousin’s sackcloth on the grass, and put the stores
of the alforjas into requisition, and all three sitting down lovingly and
sociably, they made a luncheon and a supper of it all in one; and when the
sackcloth was removed, Don Quixote of La Mancha said, “Let no one
rise, and attend to me, my sons, both of you.”

</p>
<p>
It was about four in the afternoon when the sun, veiled in clouds, with
subdued light and tempered beams, enabled Don Quixote to relate, without
heat or inconvenience, what he had seen in the cave of Montesinos to his
two illustrious hearers, and he began as follows:
</p>
<p>
“A matter of some twelve or fourteen times a man’s height down
in this pit, on the right-hand side, there is a recess or space, roomy
enough to contain a large cart with its mules. A little light reaches it
through some chinks or crevices, communicating with it and open to the
surface of the earth. This recess or space I perceived when I was already
growing weary and disgusted at finding myself hanging suspended by the
rope, travelling downwards into that dark region without any certainty or
knowledge of where I was going, so I resolved to enter it and rest myself
for a while. I called out, telling you not to let out more rope until I
bade you, but you cannot have heard me. I then gathered in the rope you
were sending me, and making a coil or pile of it I seated myself upon it,
ruminating and considering what I was to do to lower myself to the bottom,
having no one to hold me up; and as I was thus deep in thought and
perplexity, suddenly and without provocation a profound sleep fell upon
me, and when I least expected it, I know not how, I awoke and found myself
in the midst of the most beautiful, delightful meadow that nature could
produce or the most lively human imagination conceive. I opened my eyes, I
rubbed them, and found I was not asleep but thoroughly awake.
Nevertheless, I felt my head and breast to satisfy myself whether it was I
myself who was there or some empty delusive phantom; but touch, feeling,
the collected thoughts that passed through my mind, all convinced me that
I was the same then and there that I am this moment. Next there presented
itself to my sight a stately royal palace or castle, with walls that
seemed built of clear transparent crystal; and through two great doors
that opened wide therein, I saw coming forth and advancing towards me a
venerable old man, clad in a long gown of mulberry-coloured serge that
trailed upon the ground. On his shoulders and breast he had a green satin
collegiate hood, and covering his head a black Milanese bonnet, and his
snow-white beard fell below his girdle. He carried no arms whatever,
nothing but a rosary of beads bigger than fair-sized filberts, each tenth
bead being like a moderate ostrich egg; his bearing, his gait, his dignity
and imposing presence held me spellbound and wondering. He approached me,
and the first thing he did was to embrace me closely, and then he said to
me, ‘For a long time now, O valiant knight Don Quixote of La Mancha,
we who are here enchanted in these solitudes have been hoping to see thee,
that thou mayest make known to the world what is shut up and concealed in
this deep cave, called the cave of Montesinos, which thou hast entered, an
achievement reserved for thy invincible heart and stupendous courage alone
to attempt. Come with me, illustrious sir, and I will show thee the
marvels hidden within this transparent castle, whereof I am the alcaide
and perpetual warden; for I am Montesinos himself, from whom the cave
takes its name.’
</p>
<p>
“The instant he told me he was Montesinos, I asked him if the story
they told in the world above here was true, that he had taken out the
heart of his great friend Durandarte from his breast with a little dagger,
and carried it to the lady Belerma, as his friend when at the point of
death had commanded him. He said in reply that they spoke the truth in
every respect except as to the dagger, for it was not a dagger, nor
little, but a burnished poniard sharper than an awl.”
</p>
<p>
“That poniard must have been made by Ramon de Hoces the Sevillian,”
said Sancho.
</p>
<p>
“I do not know,” said Don Quixote; “it could not have
been by that poniard maker, however, because Ramon de Hoces was a man of
yesterday, and the affair of Roncesvalles, where this mishap occurred, was
long ago; but the question is of no great importance, nor does it affect
or make any alteration in the truth or substance of the story.”
</p>
<p>
“That is true,” said the cousin; “continue, Señor Don
Quixote, for I am listening to you with the greatest pleasure in the
world.”
</p>
<p>
“And with no less do I tell the tale,” said Don Quixote;
“and so, to proceed—the venerable Montesinos led me into the
palace of crystal, where, in a lower chamber, strangely cool and entirely
of alabaster, was an elaborately wrought marble tomb, upon which I beheld,
stretched at full length, a knight, not of bronze, or marble, or jasper,
as are seen on other tombs, but of actual flesh and bone. His right hand
(which seemed to me somewhat hairy and sinewy, a sign of great strength in
its owner) lay on the side of his heart; but before I could put any
question to Montesinos, he, seeing me gazing at the tomb in amazement,
said to me, ‘This is my friend Durandarte, flower and mirror of the
true lovers and valiant knights of his time. He is held enchanted here, as
I myself and many others are, by that French enchanter Merlin, who, they
say, was the devil’s son; but my belief is, not that he was the
devil’s son, but that he knew, as the saying is, a point more than
the devil. How or why he enchanted us, no one knows, but time will tell,
and I suspect that time is not far off. What I marvel at is, that I know
it to be as sure as that it is now day, that Durandarte ended his life in
my arms, and that, after his death, I took out his heart with my own
hands; and indeed it must have weighed more than two pounds, for,
according to naturalists, he who has a large heart is more largely endowed
with valour than he who has a small one. Then, as this is the case, and as
the knight did really die, how comes it that he now moans and sighs from
time to time, as if he were still alive?’

</p>
<p>
“As he said this, the wretched Durandarte cried out in a loud voice:
</p>
<p class="poem">
O cousin Montesinos!<br>
’Twas my last request of thee,<br>
When my soul hath left the body,<br>
And that lying dead I be,<br>
With thy poniard or thy dagger<br>
Cut the heart from out my breast,<br>
And bear it to Belerma.<br>
This was my last request.”<br>
</p>
<p>
“On hearing which, the venerable Montesinos fell on his knees before
the unhappy knight, and with tearful eyes exclaimed, ‘Long since,
Señor Durandarte, my beloved cousin, long since have I done what you bade
me on that sad day when I lost you; I took out your heart as well as I
could, not leaving an atom of it in your breast, I wiped it with a lace
handkerchief, and I took the road to France with it, having first laid you
in the bosom of the earth with tears enough to wash and cleanse my hands
of the blood that covered them after wandering among your bowels; and more
by token, O cousin of my soul, at the first village I came to after
leaving Roncesvalles, I sprinkled a little salt upon your heart to keep it
sweet, and bring it, if not fresh, at least pickled, into the presence of
the lady Belerma, whom, together with you, myself, Guadiana your squire,
the duenna Ruidera and her seven daughters and two nieces, and many more
of your friends and acquaintances, the sage Merlin has been keeping
enchanted here these many years; and although more than five hundred have
gone by, not one of us has died; Ruidera and her daughters and nieces
alone are missing, and these, because of the tears they shed, Merlin, out
of the compassion he seems to have felt for them, changed into so many
lakes, which to this day in the world of the living, and in the province
of La Mancha, are called the Lakes of Ruidera. The seven daughters belong
to the kings of Spain and the two nieces to the knights of a very holy
order called the Order of St. John. Guadiana your squire, likewise
bewailing your fate, was changed into a river of his own name, but when he
came to the surface and beheld the sun of another heaven, so great was his
grief at finding he was leaving you, that he plunged into the bowels of
the earth; however, as he cannot help following his natural course, he
from time to time comes forth and shows himself to the sun and the world.
The lakes aforesaid send him their waters, and with these, and others that
come to him, he makes a grand and imposing entrance into Portugal; but for
all that, go where he may, he shows his melancholy and sadness, and takes
no pride in breeding dainty choice fish, only coarse and tasteless sorts,
very different from those of the golden Tagus. All this that I tell you
now, O cousin mine, I have told you many times before, and as you make no
answer, I fear that either you believe me not, or do not hear me, whereat
I feel God knows what grief. I have now news to give you, which, if it
serves not to alleviate your sufferings, will not in any wise increase
them. Know that you have here before you (open your eyes and you will see)
that great knight of whom the sage Merlin has prophesied such great
things; that Don Quixote of La Mancha I mean, who has again, and to better
purpose than in past times, revived in these days knight-errantry, long
since forgotten, and by whose intervention and aid it may be we shall be
disenchanted; for great deeds are reserved for great men.’
</p>
<p>
“‘And if that may not be,’ said the wretched Durandarte
in a low and feeble voice, ‘if that may not be, then, my cousin, I
say “patience and shuffle;”’ and turning over on his
side, he relapsed into his former silence without uttering another word.

“And now there was heard a great outcry and lamentation, accompanied
by deep sighs and bitter sobs. I looked round, and through the crystal
wall I saw passing through another chamber a procession of two lines of
fair damsels all clad in mourning, and with white turbans of Turkish
fashion on their heads. Behind, in the rear of these, there came a lady,
for so from her dignity she seemed to be, also clad in black, with a white
veil so long and ample that it swept the ground. Her turban was twice as
large as the largest of any of the others; her eyebrows met, her nose was
rather flat, her mouth was large but with ruddy lips, and her teeth, of
which at times she allowed a glimpse, were seen to be sparse and ill-set,
though as white as peeled almonds. She carried in her hands a fine cloth,
and in it, as well as I could make out, a heart that had been mummied, so
parched and dried was it. Montesinos told me that all those forming the
procession were the attendants of Durandarte and Belerma, who were
enchanted there with their master and mistress, and that the last, she who
carried the heart in the cloth, was the lady Belerma, who, with her
damsels, four days in the week went in procession singing, or rather
weeping, dirges over the body and miserable heart of his cousin; and that
if she appeared to me somewhat ill-favoured or not so beautiful as fame
reported her, it was because of the bad nights and worse days that she
passed in that enchantment, as I could see by the great dark circles round
her eyes, and her sickly complexion; ‘her sallowness, and the rings
round her eyes,’ said he, ‘are not caused by the periodical
ailment usual with women, for it is many months and even years since she
has had any, but by the grief her own heart suffers because of that which
she holds in her hand perpetually, and which recalls and brings back to
her memory the sad fate of her lost lover; were it not for this, hardly
would the great Dulcinea del Toboso, so celebrated in all these parts, and
even in the world, come up to her for beauty, grace, and gaiety.’
</p>
<p>
“‘Hold hard!’ said I at this, ‘tell your story as you
ought, Señor Don Montesinos, for you know very well that all comparisons are
odious, and there is no occasion to compare one person with another; the
peerless Dulcinea del Toboso is what she is, and the lady Doña Belerma is what
<i>she</i> is and has been, and that’s enough.’ To which he made
answer, ‘Forgive me, Señor Don Quixote; I own I was wrong and spoke
unadvisedly in saying that the lady Dulcinea could scarcely come up to the lady
Belerma; for it were enough for me to have learned, by what means I know not,
that you are her knight, to make me bite my tongue out before I compared her to
anything save heaven itself.’ After this apology which the great
Montesinos made me, my heart recovered itself from the shock I had received in
hearing my lady compared with Belerma.”
</p>
<p>
“Still I wonder,” said Sancho, “that your worship did
not get upon the old fellow and bruise every bone of him with kicks, and
pluck his beard until you didn’t leave a hair in it.”
</p>
<p>
“Nay, Sancho, my friend,” said Don Quixote, “it would
not have been right in me to do that, for we are all bound to pay respect
to the aged, even though they be not knights, but especially to those who
are, and who are enchanted; I only know I gave him as good as he brought
in the many other questions and answers we exchanged.”
</p>
<p>
“I cannot understand, Señor Don Quixote,” remarked the cousin
here, “how it is that your worship, in such a short space of time as
you have been below there, could have seen so many things, and said and
answered so much.”
</p>
<p>
“How long is it since I went down?” asked Don Quixote.
</p>
<p>
“Little better than an hour,” replied Sancho.
</p>
<p>
“That cannot be,” returned Don Quixote, “because night
overtook me while I was there, and day came, and it was night again and
day again three times; so that, by my reckoning, I have been three days in
those remote regions beyond our ken.”
</p>
<p>
“My master must be right,” replied Sancho; “for as
everything that has happened to him is by enchantment, maybe what seems to
us an hour would seem three days and nights there.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s it,” said Don Quixote.
</p>
<p>
“And did your worship eat anything all that time, señor?”
asked the cousin.
</p>
<p>
“I never touched a morsel,” answered Don Quixote, “nor
did I feel hunger, or think of it.”
</p>
<p>
“And do the enchanted eat?” said the cousin.
</p>
<p>
“They neither eat,” said Don Quixote; “nor are they
subject to the greater excrements, though it is thought that their nails,
beards, and hair grow.”
</p>
<p>
“And do the enchanted sleep, now, señor?” asked Sancho.
</p>
<p>
“Certainly not,” replied Don Quixote; “at least, during
those three days I was with them not one of them closed an eye, nor did I
either.”
</p>
<p>
“The proverb, ‘Tell me what company thou keepest and I’ll
tell thee what thou art,’ is to the point here,” said Sancho;
“your worship keeps company with enchanted people that are always
fasting and watching; what wonder is it, then, that you neither eat nor
sleep while you are with them? But forgive me, señor, if I say that of all
this you have told us now, may God take me—I was just going to say
the devil—if I believe a single particle.”
</p>
<p>
“What!” said the cousin, “has Señor Don Quixote, then,
been lying? Why, even if he wished it he has not had time to imagine and
put together such a host of lies.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t believe my master lies,” said Sancho.
</p>
<p>
“If not, what dost thou believe?” asked Don Quixote.
</p>
<p>
“I believe,” replied Sancho, “that this Merlin, or those
enchanters who enchanted the whole crew your worship says you saw and
discoursed with down there, stuffed your imagination or your mind with all
this rigmarole you have been treating us to, and all that is still to
come.”
</p>
<p>
“All that might be, Sancho,” replied Don Quixote; “but
it is not so, for everything that I have told you I saw with my own eyes,
and touched with my own hands. But what will you say when I tell you now
how, among the countless other marvellous things Montesinos showed me (of
which at leisure and at the proper time I will give thee an account in the
course of our journey, for they would not be all in place here), he showed
me three country girls who went skipping and capering like goats over the
pleasant fields there, and the instant I beheld them I knew one to be the
peerless Dulcinea del Toboso, and the other two those same country girls
that were with her and that we spoke to on the road from El Toboso! I
asked Montesinos if he knew them, and he told me he did not, but he
thought they must be some enchanted ladies of distinction, for it was only
a few days before that they had made their appearance in those meadows;
but I was not to be surprised at that, because there were a great many
other ladies there of times past and present, enchanted in various strange
shapes, and among them he had recognised Queen Guinevere and her dame
Quintañona, she who poured out the wine for Lancelot when he came from
Britain.”
</p>
<p>
When Sancho Panza heard his master say this he was ready to take leave of
his senses, or die with laughter; for, as he knew the real truth about the
pretended enchantment of Dulcinea, in which he himself had been the
enchanter and concocter of all the evidence, he made up his mind at last
that, beyond all doubt, his master was out of his wits and stark mad, so
he said to him, “It was an evil hour, a worse season, and a
sorrowful day, when your worship, dear master mine, went down to the other
world, and an unlucky moment when you met with Señor Montesinos, who has
sent you back to us like this. You were well enough here above in your
full senses, such as God had given you, delivering maxims and giving
advice at every turn, and not as you are now, talking the greatest
nonsense that can be imagined.”
</p>
<p>
“As I know thee, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “I heed not
thy words.”
</p>
<p>
“Nor I your worship’s,” said Sancho, “whether you
beat me or kill me for those I have spoken, and will speak if you don’t
correct and mend your own. But tell me, while we are still at peace, how
or by what did you recognise the lady our mistress; and if you spoke to
her, what did you say, and what did she answer?”
</p>
<p>
“I recognised her,” said Don Quixote, “by her wearing
the same garments she wore when thou didst point her out to me. I spoke to
her, but she did not utter a word in reply; on the contrary, she turned
her back on me and took to flight, at such a pace that crossbow bolt could
not have overtaken her. I wished to follow her, and would have done so had
not Montesinos recommended me not to take the trouble as it would be
useless, particularly as the time was drawing near when it would be
necessary for me to quit the cavern. He told me, moreover, that in course
of time he would let me know how he and Belerma, and Durandarte, and all
who were there, were to be disenchanted. But of all I saw and observed
down there, what gave me most pain was, that while Montesinos was speaking
to me, one of the two companions of the hapless Dulcinea approached me on
one without my having seen her coming, and with tears in her eyes said to
me, in a low, agitated voice, ‘My lady Dulcinea del Toboso kisses
your worship’s hands, and entreats you to do her the favour of
letting her know how you are; and, being in great need, she also entreats
your worship as earnestly as she can to be so good as to lend her half a
dozen reals, or as much as you may have about you, on this new dimity
petticoat that I have here; and she promises to repay them very speedily.’
I was amazed and taken aback by such a message, and turning to Señor
Montesinos I asked him, ‘Is it possible, Señor Montesinos, that
persons of distinction under enchantment can be in need?’ To which
he replied, ‘Believe me, Señor Don Quixote, that which is called
need is to be met with everywhere, and penetrates all quarters and reaches
everyone, and does not spare even the enchanted; and as the lady Dulcinea
del Toboso sends to beg those six reals, and the pledge is to all
appearance a good one, there is nothing for it but to give them to her,
for no doubt she must be in some great strait.’ ‘I will take
no pledge of her,’ I replied, ‘nor yet can I give her what she
asks, for all I have is four reals; which I gave (they were those which
thou, Sancho, gavest me the other day to bestow in alms upon the poor I
met along the road), and I said, ‘Tell your mistress, my dear, that
I am grieved to the heart because of her distresses, and wish I was a
Fucar to remedy them, and that I would have her know that I cannot be, and
ought not be, in health while deprived of the happiness of seeing her and
enjoying her discreet conversation, and that I implore her as earnestly as
I can, to allow herself to be seen and addressed by this her captive
servant and forlorn knight. Tell her, too, that when she least expects it
she will hear it announced that I have made an oath and vow after the
fashion of that which the Marquis of Mantua made to avenge his nephew
Baldwin, when he found him at the point of death in the heart of the
mountains, which was, not to eat bread off a tablecloth, and other
trifling matters which he added, until he had avenged him; and I will make
the same to take no rest, and to roam the seven regions of the earth more
thoroughly than the Infante Don Pedro of Portugal ever roamed them, until
I have disenchanted her.’ ‘All that and more, you owe my lady,’
the damsel’s answer to me, and taking the four reals, instead of
making me a curtsey she cut a caper, springing two full yards into the
air.”
</p>
<p>
“O blessed God!” exclaimed Sancho aloud at this, “is it
possible that such things can be in the world, and that enchanters and
enchantments can have such power in it as to have changed my master’s
right senses into a craze so full of absurdity! O señor, señor, for God’s
sake, consider yourself, have a care for your honour, and give no credit
to this silly stuff that has left you scant and short of wits.”
</p>
<p>
“Thou talkest in this way because thou lovest me, Sancho,”
said Don Quixote; “and not being experienced in the things of the
world, everything that has some difficulty about it seems to thee
impossible; but time will pass, as I said before, and I will tell thee
some of the things I saw down there which will make thee believe what I
have related now, the truth of which admits of neither reply nor question.”

He who translated this great history from the original written by its
first author, Cide Hamete Benengeli, says that on coming to the chapter
giving the adventures of the cave of Montesinos he found written on the
margin of it, in Hamete’s own hand, these exact words:
</p>
<p>
“I cannot convince or persuade myself that everything that is
written in the preceding chapter could have precisely happened to the
valiant Don Quixote; and for this reason, that all the adventures that
have occurred up to the present have been possible and probable; but as
for this one of the cave, I see no way of accepting it as true, as it
passes all reasonable bounds. For me to believe that Don Quixote could
lie, he being the most truthful gentleman and the noblest knight of his
time, is impossible; he would not have told a lie though he were shot to
death with arrows. On the other hand, I reflect that he related and told
the story with all the circumstances detailed, and that he could not in so
short a space have fabricated such a vast complication of absurdities; if,
then, this adventure seems apocryphal, it is no fault of mine; and so,
without affirming its falsehood or its truth, I write it down. Decide for
thyself in thy wisdom, reader; for I am not bound, nor is it in my power,
to do more; though certain it is they say that at the time of his death he
retracted, and said he had invented it, thinking it matched and tallied
with the adventures he had read of in his histories.” And then he
goes on to say:
</p>
<p>
The cousin was amazed as well at Sancho’s boldness as at the
patience of his master, and concluded that the good temper the latter
displayed arose from the happiness he felt at having seen his lady
Dulcinea, even enchanted as she was; because otherwise the words and
language Sancho had addressed to him deserved a thrashing; for indeed he
seemed to him to have been rather impudent to his master, to whom he now
observed, “I, Señor Don Quixote of La Mancha, look upon the time I
have spent in travelling with your worship as very well employed, for I
have gained four things in the course of it; the first is that I have made
your acquaintance, which I consider great good fortune; the second, that I
have learned what the cave of Montesinos contains, together with the
transformations of Guadiana and of the lakes of Ruidera; which will be of
use to me for the Spanish Ovid that I have in hand; the third, to have
discovered the antiquity of cards, that they were in use at least in the
time of Charlemagne, as may be inferred from the words you say Durandarte
uttered when, at the end of that long spell while Montesinos was talking
to him, he woke up and said, ‘Patience and shuffle.’ This
phrase and expression he could not have learned while he was enchanted,
but only before he had become so, in France, and in the time of the
aforesaid emperor Charlemagne. And this demonstration is just the thing
for me for that other book I am writing, the ‘Supplement to Polydore
Vergil on the Invention of Antiquities;’ for I believe he never
thought of inserting that of cards in his book, as I mean to do in mine,
and it will be a matter of great importance, particularly when I can cite
so grave and veracious an authority as Señor Durandarte. And the fourth
thing is, that I have ascertained the source of the river Guadiana,
heretofore unknown to mankind.”
</p>
<p>
“You are right,” said Don Quixote; “but I should like to
know, if by God’s favour they grant you a licence to print those
books of yours—which I doubt—to whom do you mean to dedicate
them?”
</p>
<p>
“There are lords and grandees in Spain to whom they can be
dedicated,” said the cousin.
</p>
<p>
“Not many,” said Don Quixote; “not that they are
unworthy of it, but because they do not care to accept books and incur the
obligation of making the return that seems due to the author’s
labour and courtesy. One prince I know who makes up for all the rest, and
more—how much more, if I ventured to say, perhaps I should stir up
envy in many a noble breast; but let this stand over for some more
convenient time, and let us go and look for some place to shelter
ourselves in to-night.”
</p>
<p>
“Not far from this,” said the cousin, “there is a
hermitage, where there lives a hermit, who they say was a soldier, and who
has the reputation of being a good Christian and a very intelligent and
charitable man. Close to the hermitage he has a small house which he built
at his own cost, but though small it is large enough for the reception of
guests.”
</p>
<p>
“Has this hermit any hens, do you think?” asked Sancho.
</p>
<p>
“Few hermits are without them,” said Don Quixote; “for
those we see now-a-days are not like the hermits of the Egyptian deserts
who were clad in palm-leaves, and lived on the roots of the earth. But do
not think that by praising these I am disparaging the others; all I mean
to say is that the penances of those of the present day do not come up to
the asceticism and austerity of former times; but it does not follow from
this that they are not all worthy; at least I think them so; and at the
worst the hypocrite who pretends to be good does less harm than the open
sinner.”
</p>
<p>
At this point they saw approaching the spot where they stood a man on
foot, proceeding at a rapid pace, and beating a mule loaded with lances
and halberds. When he came up to them, he saluted them and passed on
without stopping. Don Quixote called to him, “Stay, good fellow; you
seem to be making more haste than suits that mule.”
</p>
<p>
“I cannot stop, señor,” answered the man; “for the arms
you see I carry here are to be used to-morrow, so I must not delay; God be
with you. But if you want to know what I am carrying them for, I mean to
lodge to-night at the inn that is beyond the hermitage, and if you be
going the same road you will find me there, and I will tell you some
curious things; once more God be with you;” and he urged on his mule
at such a pace that Don Quixote had no time to ask him what these curious
things were that he meant to tell them; and as he was somewhat
inquisitive, and always tortured by his anxiety to learn something new, he
decided to set out at once, and go and pass the night at the inn instead
of stopping at the hermitage, where the cousin would have had them halt.
Accordingly they mounted and all three took the direct road for the inn,
which they reached a little before nightfall. On the road the cousin
proposed they should go up to the hermitage to drink a sup. The instant
Sancho heard this he steered his Dapple towards it, and Don Quixote and
the cousin did the same; but it seems Sancho’s bad luck so ordered
it that the hermit was not at home, for so a sub-hermit they found in the
hermitage told them. They called for some of the best. She replied that
her master had none, but that if they liked cheap water she would give it
with great pleasure.
</p>
<p>
“If I found any in water,” said Sancho, “there are wells
along the road where I could have had enough of it. Ah, Camacho’s
wedding, and plentiful house of Don Diego, how often do I miss you!”
</p>
<p>
Leaving the hermitage, they pushed on towards the inn, and a little
farther they came upon a youth who was pacing along in front of them at no
great speed, so that they overtook him. He carried a sword over his
shoulder, and slung on it a budget or bundle of his clothes apparently,
probably his breeches or pantaloons, and his cloak and a shirt or two; for
he had on a short jacket of velvet with a gloss like satin on it in
places, and had his shirt out; his stockings were of silk, and his shoes
square-toed as they wear them at court. His age might have been eighteen
or nineteen; he was of a merry countenance, and to all appearance of an
active habit, and he went along singing seguidillas to beguile the
wearisomeness of the road. As they came up with him he was just finishing
one, which the cousin got by heart and they say ran thus—
</p>
<p class="poem">
I’m off to the wars<br>
For the want of pence,<br>
Oh, had I but money<br>
I’d show more sense.
</p>
<p>
The first to address him was Don Quixote, who said, “You travel very
airily, sir gallant; whither bound, may we ask, if it is your pleasure to
tell us?”
</p>
<p>
To which the youth replied, “The heat and my poverty are the reason
of my travelling so airily, and it is to the wars that I am bound.”
</p>
<p>
“How poverty?” asked Don Quixote; “the heat one can
understand.”
</p>
<p>
“Señor,” replied the youth, “in this bundle I carry
velvet pantaloons to match this jacket; if I wear them out on the road, I
shall not be able to make a decent appearance in them in the city, and I
have not the wherewithal to buy others; and so for this reason, as well as
to keep myself cool, I am making my way in this fashion to overtake some
companies of infantry that are not twelve leagues off, in which I shall
enlist, and there will be no want of baggage trains to travel with after
that to the place of embarkation, which they say will be Carthagena; I
would rather have the King for a master, and serve him in the wars, than
serve a court pauper.”
</p>
<p>
“And did you get any bounty, now?” asked the cousin.
</p>
<p>
“If I had been in the service of some grandee of Spain or personage
of distinction,” replied the youth, “I should have been safe
to get it; for that is the advantage of serving good masters, that out of
the servants’ hall men come to be ancients or captains, or get a
good pension. But I, to my misfortune, always served place-hunters and
adventurers, whose keep and wages were so miserable and scanty that half
went in paying for the starching of one’s collars; it would be a
miracle indeed if a page volunteer ever got anything like a reasonable
bounty.”
</p>
<p>
“And tell me, for heaven’s sake,” asked Don Quixote,
“is it possible, my friend, that all the time you served you never
got any livery?”
</p>
<p>
“They gave me two,” replied the page; “but just as when
one quits a religious community before making profession, they strip him
of the dress of the order and give him back his own clothes, so did my
masters return me mine; for as soon as the business on which they came to
court was finished, they went home and took back the liveries they had
given merely for show.”
</p>
<p>
“What spilorceria!—as an Italian would say,” said Don
Quixote; “but for all that, consider yourself happy in having left
court with as worthy an object as you have, for there is nothing on earth
more honourable or profitable than serving, first of all God, and then one’s
king and natural lord, particularly in the profession of arms, by which,
if not more wealth, at least more honour is to be won than by letters, as
I have said many a time; for though letters may have founded more great
houses than arms, still those founded by arms have I know not what
superiority over those founded by letters, and a certain splendour
belonging to them that distinguishes them above all. And bear in mind what
I am now about to say to you, for it will be of great use and comfort to
you in time of trouble; it is, not to let your mind dwell on the adverse
chances that may befall you; for the worst of all is death, and if it be a
good death, the best of all is to die. They asked Julius Cæsar, the
valiant Roman emperor, what was the best death. He answered, that which is
unexpected, which comes suddenly and unforeseen; and though he answered
like a pagan, and one without the knowledge of the true God, yet, as far
as sparing our feelings is concerned, he was right; for suppose you are
killed in the first engagement or skirmish, whether by a cannon ball or
blown up by mine, what matters it? It is only dying, and all is over; and
according to Terence, a soldier shows better dead in battle, than alive
and safe in flight; and the good soldier wins fame in proportion as he is
obedient to his captains and those in command over him. And remember, my
son, that it is better for the soldier to smell of gunpowder than of
civet, and that if old age should come upon you in this honourable
calling, though you may be covered with wounds and crippled and lame, it
will not come upon you without honour, and that such as poverty cannot
lessen; especially now that provisions are being made for supporting and
relieving old and disabled soldiers; for it is not right to deal with them
after the fashion of those who set free and get rid of their black slaves
when they are old and useless, and, turning them out of their houses under
the pretence of making them free, make them slaves to hunger, from which
they cannot expect to be released except by death. But for the present I
won’t say more than get ye up behind me on my horse as far as the
inn, and sup with me there, and to-morrow you shall pursue your journey,
and God give you as good speed as your intentions deserve.”
</p>
<p>
The page did not accept the invitation to mount, though he did that to
supper at the inn; and here they say Sancho said to himself, “God be
with you for a master; is it possible that a man who can say things so
many and so good as he has said just now, can say that he saw the
impossible absurdities he reports about the cave of Montesinos? Well,
well, we shall see.”
</p>
<p>
And now, just as night was falling, they reached the inn, and it was not
without satisfaction that Sancho perceived his master took it for a real
inn, and not for a castle as usual. The instant they entered Don Quixote
asked the landlord after the man with the lances and halberds, and was
told that he was in the stable seeing to his mule; which was what Sancho
and the cousin proceeded to do for their beasts, giving the best manger
and the best place in the stable to Rocinante.

<p>
Don Quixote’s bread would not bake, as the common saying is, until
he had heard and learned the curious things promised by the man who
carried the arms. He went to seek him where the innkeeper said he was and
having found him, bade him say now at any rate what he had to say in
answer to the question he had asked him on the road. “The tale of my
wonders must be taken more leisurely and not standing,” said the
man; “let me finish foddering my beast, good sir; and then I’ll
tell you things that will astonish you.”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t wait for that,” said Don Quixote; “I’ll
help you in everything,” and so he did, sifting the barley for him
and cleaning out the manger; a degree of humility which made the other
feel bound to tell him with a good grace what he had asked; so seating
himself on a bench, with Don Quixote beside him, and the cousin, the page,
Sancho Panza, and the landlord, for a senate and an audience, he began his
story in this way:
</p>
<p>
“You must know that in a village four leagues and a half from this
inn, it so happened that one of the regidors, by the tricks and roguery of
a servant girl of his (it’s too long a tale to tell), lost an ass;
and though he did all he possibly could to find it, it was all to no
purpose. A fortnight might have gone by, so the story goes, since the ass
had been missing, when, as the regidor who had lost it was standing in the
plaza, another regidor of the same town said to him, ‘Pay me for
good news, gossip; your ass has turned up.’ ‘That I will, and
well, gossip,’ said the other; ‘but tell us, where has he
turned up?’ ‘In the forest,’ said the finder; ‘I
saw him this morning without pack-saddle or harness of any sort, and so
lean that it went to one’s heart to see him. I tried to drive him
before me and bring him to you, but he is already so wild and shy that
when I went near him he made off into the thickest part of the forest. If
you have a mind that we two should go back and look for him, let me put up
this she-ass at my house and I’ll be back at once.’ ‘You
will be doing me a great kindness,’ said the owner of the ass,
‘and I’ll try to pay it back in the same coin.’ It is
with all these circumstances, and in the very same way I am telling it
now, that those who know all about the matter tell the story. Well then,
the two regidors set off on foot, arm in arm, for the forest, and coming
to the place where they hoped to find the ass they could not find him, nor
was he to be seen anywhere about, search as they might. Seeing, then, that
there was no sign of him, the regidor who had seen him said to the other,
‘Look here, gossip; a plan has occurred to me, by which, beyond a
doubt, we shall manage to discover the animal, even if he is stowed away
in the bowels of the earth, not to say the forest. Here it is. I can bray
to perfection, and if you can ever so little, the thing’s as good as
done.’ ‘Ever so little did you say, gossip?’ said the
other; ‘by God, I’ll not give in to anybody, not even to the
asses themselves.’ ‘We’ll soon see,’ said the
second regidor, ‘for my plan is that you should go one side of the
forest, and I the other, so as to go all round about it; and every now and
then you will bray and I will bray; and it cannot be but that the ass will
hear us, and answer us if he is in the forest.’ To which the owner
of the ass replied, ‘It’s an excellent plan, I declare,
gossip, and worthy of your great genius;’ and the two separating as
agreed, it so fell out that they brayed almost at the same moment, and
each, deceived by the braying of the other, ran to look, fancying the ass
had turned up at last. When they came in sight of one another, said the
loser, ‘Is it possible, gossip, that it was not my ass that brayed?’
‘No, it was I,’ said the other. ‘Well then, I can tell
you, gossip,’ said the ass’s owner, ‘that between you
and an ass there is not an atom of difference as far as braying goes, for
I never in all my life saw or heard anything more natural.’ ‘Those
praises and compliments belong to you more justly than to me, gossip,’
said the inventor of the plan; ‘for, by the God that made me, you
might give a couple of brays odds to the best and most finished brayer in
the world; the tone you have got is deep, your voice is well kept up as to
time and pitch, and your finishing notes come thick and fast; in fact, I
own myself beaten, and yield the palm to you, and give in to you in this
rare accomplishment.’ ‘Well then,’ said the owner,
‘I’ll set a higher value on myself for the future, and
consider that I know something, as I have an excellence of some sort; for
though I always thought I brayed well, I never supposed I came up to the
pitch of perfection you say.’ ‘And I say too,’ said the
second, ‘that there are rare gifts going to loss in the world, and
that they are ill bestowed upon those who don’t know how to make use
of them.’ ‘Ours,’ said the owner of the ass, ‘unless
it is in cases like this we have now in hand, cannot be of any service to
us, and even in this God grant they may be of some use.’ So saying
they separated, and took to their braying once more, but every instant
they were deceiving one another, and coming to meet one another again,
until they arranged by way of countersign, so as to know that it was they
and not the ass, to give two brays, one after the other. In this way,
doubling the brays at every step, they made the complete circuit of the
forest, but the lost ass never gave them an answer or even the sign of
one. How could the poor ill-starred brute have answered, when, in the
thickest part of the forest, they found him devoured by wolves? As soon as
he saw him his owner said, ‘I was wondering he did not answer, for
if he wasn’t dead he’d have brayed when he heard us, or he’d
have been no ass; but for the sake of having heard you bray to such
perfection, gossip, I count the trouble I have taken to look for him well
bestowed, even though I have found him dead.’ ‘It’s in a
good hand, gossip,’ said the other; ‘if the abbot sings well,
the acolyte is not much behind him.’ So they returned disconsolate
and hoarse to their village, where they told their friends, neighbours,
and acquaintances what had befallen them in their search for the ass, each
crying up the other’s perfection in braying. The whole story came to
be known and spread abroad through the villages of the neighbourhood; and
the devil, who never sleeps, with his love for sowing dissensions and
scattering discord everywhere, blowing mischief about and making quarrels
out of nothing, contrived to make the people of the other towns fall to
braying whenever they saw anyone from our village, as if to throw the
braying of our regidors in our teeth. Then the boys took to it, which was
the same thing for it as getting into the hands and mouths of all the
devils of hell; and braying spread from one town to another in such a way
that the men of the braying town are as easy to be known as blacks are to
be known from whites, and the unlucky joke has gone so far that several
times the scoffed have come out in arms and in a body to do battle with
the scoffers, and neither king nor rook, fear nor shame, can mend matters.
To-morrow or the day after, I believe, the men of my town, that is, of the
braying town, are going to take the field against another village two
leagues away from ours, one of those that persecute us most; and that we
may turn out well prepared I have bought these lances and halberds you
have seen. These are the curious things I told you I had to tell, and if
you don’t think them so, I have got no others;” and with this
the worthy fellow brought his story to a close.
</p>
<p>
Just at this moment there came in at the gate of the inn a man entirely
clad in chamois leather, hose, breeches, and doublet, who said in a loud
voice, “Señor host, have you room? Here’s the divining ape and
the show of the Release of Melisendra just coming.”
</p>
<p>
“Ods body!” said the landlord, “why, it’s Master
Pedro! We’re in for a grand night!” I forgot to mention that
the said Master Pedro had his left eye and nearly half his cheek covered
with a patch of green taffety, showing that something ailed all that side.
“Your worship is welcome, Master Pedro,” continued the
landlord; “but where are the ape and the show, for I don’t see
them?” “They are close at hand,” said he in the chamois
leather, “but I came on first to know if there was any room.”
“I’d make the Duke of Alva himself clear out to make room for
Master Pedro,” said the landlord; “bring in the ape and the
show; there’s company in the inn to-night that will pay to see that
and the cleverness of the ape.” “So be it by all means,”
said the man with the patch; “I’ll lower the price, and be
well satisfied if I only pay my expenses; and now I’ll go back and
hurry on the cart with the ape and the show;” and with this he went
out of the inn.
</p>
<p>
Don Quixote at once asked the landlord what this Master Pedro was, and
what was the show and what was the ape he had with him; which the landlord
replied, “This is a famous puppet-showman, who for some time past
has been going about this Mancha de Aragon, exhibiting a show of the
release of Melisendra by the famous Don Gaiferos, one of the best and
best-represented stories that have been seen in this part of the kingdom
for many a year; he has also with him an ape with the most extraordinary
gift ever seen in an ape or imagined in a human being; for if you ask him
anything, he listens attentively to the question, and then jumps on his
master’s shoulder, and pressing close to his ear tells him the
answer which Master Pedro then delivers. He says a great deal more about
things past than about things to come; and though he does not always hit
the truth in every case, most times he is not far wrong, so that he makes
us fancy he has got the devil in him. He gets two reals for every question
if the ape answers; I mean if his master answers for him after he has
whispered into his ear; and so it is believed that this same Master Pedro
is very rich. He is a ‘gallant man’ as they say in Italy, and
good company, and leads the finest life in the world; talks more than six,
drinks more than a dozen, and all by his tongue, and his ape, and his
show.”
</p>
<p>
Master Pedro now came back, and in a cart followed the show and the ape—a
big one, without a tail and with buttocks as bare as felt, but not
vicious-looking. As soon as Don Quixote saw him, he asked him, “Can
you tell me, sir fortune-teller, what fish do we catch, and how will it be
with us? See, here are my two reals,” and he bade Sancho give them
to Master Pedro; but he answered for the ape and said, “Señor, this
animal does not give any answer or information touching things that are to
come; of things past he knows something, and more or less of things
present.”
</p>
<p>
“Gad,” said Sancho, “I would not give a farthing to be
told what’s past with me, for who knows that better than I do
myself? And to pay for being told what I know would be mighty foolish. But
as you know things present, here are my two reals, and tell me, most
excellent sir ape, what is my wife Teresa Panza doing now, and what is she
diverting herself with?”
</p>
<p>
Master Pedro refused to take the money, saying, “I will not receive
payment in advance or until the service has been first rendered;”
and then with his right hand he gave a couple of slaps on his left
shoulder, and with one spring the ape perched himself upon it, and putting
his mouth to his master’s ear began chattering his teeth rapidly;
and having kept this up as long as one would be saying a credo, with
another spring he brought himself to the ground, and the same instant
Master Pedro ran in great haste and fell upon his knees before Don
Quixote, and embracing his legs exclaimed, “These legs do I embrace
as I would embrace the two pillars of Hercules, O illustrious reviver of
knight-errantry, so long consigned to oblivion! O never yet duly extolled
knight, Don Quixote of La Mancha, courage of the faint-hearted, prop of
the tottering, arm of the fallen, staff and counsel of all who are
unfortunate!”

</p>
<p>
Don Quixote was thunderstruck, Sancho astounded, the cousin staggered, the
page astonished, the man from the braying town agape, the landlord in
perplexity, and, in short, everyone amazed at the words of the
puppet-showman, who went on to say, “And thou, worthy Sancho Panza,
the best squire and squire to the best knight in the world! Be of good
cheer, for thy good wife Teresa is well, and she is at this moment
hackling a pound of flax; and more by token she has at her left hand a jug
with a broken spout that holds a good drop of wine, with which she solaces
herself at her work.”
</p>
<p>
“That I can well believe,” said Sancho. “She is a lucky
one, and if it was not for her jealousy I would not change her for the
giantess Andandona, who by my master’s account was a very clever and
worthy woman; my Teresa is one of those that won’t let themselves
want for anything, though their heirs may have to pay for it.”
</p>
<p>
“Now I declare,” said Don Quixote, “he who reads much
and travels much sees and knows a great deal. I say so because what amount
of persuasion could have persuaded me that there are apes in the world
that can divine as I have seen now with my own eyes? For I am that very
Don Quixote of La Mancha this worthy animal refers to, though he has gone
rather too far in my praise; but whatever I may be, I thank heaven that it
has endowed me with a tender and compassionate heart, always disposed to
do good to all and harm to none.”
</p>
<p>
“If I had money,” said the page, “I would ask señor ape
what will happen to me in the peregrination I am making.”
</p>
<p>
To this Master Pedro, who had by this time risen from Don Quixote’s
feet, replied, “I have already said that this little beast gives no
answer as to the future; but if he did, not having money would be of no
consequence, for to oblige Señor Don Quixote, here present, I would give
up all the profits in the world. And now, because I have promised it, and
to afford him pleasure, I will set up my show and offer entertainment to
all who are in the inn, without any charge whatever.” As soon as he
heard this, the landlord, delighted beyond measure, pointed out a place
where the show might be fixed, which was done at once.
</p>
<p>
Don Quixote was not very well satisfied with the divinations of the ape,
as he did not think it proper that an ape should divine anything, either
past or future; so while Master Pedro was arranging the show, he retired
with Sancho into a corner of the stable, where, without being overheard by
anyone, he said to him, “Look here, Sancho, I have been seriously
thinking over this ape’s extraordinary gift, and have come to the
conclusion that beyond doubt this Master Pedro, his master, has a pact,
tacit or express, with the devil.”
</p>
<p>
“If the packet is express from the devil,” said Sancho,
“it must be a very dirty packet no doubt; but what good can it do
Master Pedro to have such packets?”
</p>
<p>
“Thou dost not understand me, Sancho,” said Don Quixote;
“I only mean he must have made some compact with the devil to infuse
this power into the ape, that he may get his living, and after he has
grown rich he will give him his soul, which is what the enemy of mankind
wants; this I am led to believe by observing that the ape only answers
about things past or present, and the devil’s knowledge extends no
further; for the future he knows only by guesswork, and that not always;
for it is reserved for God alone to know the times and the seasons, and
for him there is neither past nor future; all is present. This being as it
is, it is clear that this ape speaks by the spirit of the devil; and I am
astonished they have not denounced him to the Holy Office, and put him to
the question, and forced it out of him by whose virtue it is that he
divines; because it is certain this ape is not an astrologer; neither his
master nor he sets up, or knows how to set up, those figures they call
judiciary, which are now so common in Spain that there is not a jade, or
page, or old cobbler, that will not undertake to set up a figure as
readily as pick up a knave of cards from the ground, bringing to nought
the marvellous truth of the science by their lies and ignorance. I know of
a lady who asked one of these figure schemers whether her little lap-dog
would be in pup and would breed, and how many and of what colour the
little pups would be. To which señor astrologer, after having set up his
figure, made answer that the bitch would be in pup, and would drop three
pups, one green, another bright red, and the third parti-coloured,
provided she conceived between eleven and twelve either of the day or
night, and on a Monday or Saturday; but as things turned out, two days
after this the bitch died of a surfeit, and señor planet-ruler had the
credit all over the place of being a most profound astrologer, as most of
these planet-rulers have.”
</p>
<p>
“Still,” said Sancho, “I would be glad if your worship
would make Master Pedro ask his ape whether what happened your worship in
the cave of Montesinos is true; for, begging your worship’s pardon,
I, for my part, take it to have been all flam and lies, or at any rate
something you dreamt.”
</p>
<p>
“That may be,” replied Don Quixote; “however, I will do
what you suggest; though I have my own scruples about it.”
</p>
<p>
At this point Master Pedro came up in quest of Don Quixote, to tell him
the show was now ready and to come and see it, for it was worth seeing.
Don Quixote explained his wish, and begged him to ask his ape at once to
tell him whether certain things which had happened to him in the cave of
Montesinos were dreams or realities, for to him they appeared to partake
of both. Upon this Master Pedro, without answering, went back to fetch the
ape, and, having placed it in front of Don Quixote and Sancho, said:
“See here, señor ape, this gentleman wishes to know whether certain
things which happened to him in the cave called the cave of Montesinos
were false or true.” On his making the usual sign the ape mounted on
his left shoulder and seemed to whisper in his ear, and Master Pedro said
at once, “The ape says that the things you saw or that happened to
you in that cave are, part of them false, part true; and that he only
knows this and no more as regards this question; but if your worship
wishes to know more, on Friday next he will answer all that may be asked
him, for his virtue is at present exhausted, and will not return to him
till Friday, as he has said.”
</p>
<p>
“Did I not say, señor,” said Sancho, “that I could not
bring myself to believe that all your worship said about the adventures in
the cave was true, or even the half of it?”
</p>
<p>
“The course of events will tell, Sancho,” replied Don Quixote;
“time, that discloses all things, leaves nothing that it does not
drag into the light of day, though it be buried in the bosom of the earth.
But enough of that for the present; let us go and see Master Pedro’s
show, for I am sure there must be something novel in it.”
</p>
<p>
“Something!” said Master Pedro; “this show of mine has
sixty thousand novel things in it; let me tell you, Señor Don Quixote, it
is one of the best-worth-seeing things in the world this day; but <i>operibus
credite et non verbis</i>, and now let’s get to work, for it is growing
late, and we have a great deal to do and to say and show.”
</p>
<p>
Don Quixote and Sancho obeyed him and went to where the show was already
put up and uncovered, set all around with lighted wax tapers which made it
look splendid and bright. When they came to it Master Pedro ensconced
himself inside it, for it was he who had to work the puppets, and a boy, a
servant of his, posted himself outside to act as showman and explain the
mysteries of the exhibition, having a wand in his hand to point to the
figures as they came out. And so, all who were in the inn being arranged
in front of the show, some of them standing, and Don Quixote, Sancho, the
page, and cousin, accommodated with the best places, the interpreter began
to say what he will hear or see who reads or hears the next chapter.

All were silent, Tyrians and Trojans; I mean all who were watching the
show were hanging on the lips of the interpreter of its wonders, when
drums and trumpets were heard to sound inside it and cannon to go off. The
noise was soon over, and then the boy lifted up his voice and said,
“This true story which is here represented to your worships is taken
word for word from the French chronicles and from the Spanish ballads that
are in everybody’s mouth, and in the mouth of the boys about the
streets. Its subject is the release by Señor Don Gaiferos of his wife
Melisendra, when a captive in Spain at the hands of the Moors in the city
of Sansueña, for so they called then what is now called Saragossa; and
there you may see how Don Gaiferos is playing at the tables, just as they
sing it—
</p>
<p class="poem">
At tables playing Don Gaiferos sits,<br>
For Melisendra is forgotten now.
</p>
<p>
And that personage who appears there with a crown on his head and a
sceptre in his hand is the Emperor Charlemagne, the supposed father of
Melisendra, who, angered to see his son-in-law’s inaction and
unconcern, comes in to chide him; and observe with what vehemence and
energy he chides him, so that you would fancy he was going to give him
half a dozen raps with his sceptre; and indeed there are authors who say
he did give them, and sound ones too; and after having said a great deal
to him about imperilling his honour by not effecting the release of his
wife, he said, so the tale runs,
</p>
<p class="poem">
Enough I’ve said, see to it now.
</p>
<p class="noindent">
Observe, too, how the emperor turns away, and leaves Don Gaiferos fuming;
and you see now how in a burst of anger, he flings the table and the board
far from him and calls in haste for his armour, and asks his cousin Don
Roland for the loan of his sword, Durindana, and how Don Roland refuses to
lend it, offering him his company in the difficult enterprise he is
undertaking; but he, in his valour and anger, will not accept it, and says
that he alone will suffice to rescue his wife, even though she were
imprisoned deep in the centre of the earth, and with this he retires to
arm himself and set out on his journey at once. Now let your worships turn
your eyes to that tower that appears there, which is supposed to be one of
the towers of the alcazar of Saragossa, now called the Aljaferia; that
lady who appears on that balcony dressed in Moorish fashion is the
peerless Melisendra, for many a time she used to gaze from thence upon the
road to France, and seek consolation in her captivity by thinking of Paris
and her husband. Observe, too, a new incident which now occurs, such as,
perhaps, never was seen. Do you not see that Moor, who silently and
stealthily, with his finger on his lip, approaches Melisendra from behind?
Observe now how he prints a kiss upon her lips, and what a hurry she is in
to spit, and wipe them with the white sleeve of her smock, and how she
bewails herself, and tears her fair hair as though it were to blame for
the wrong. Observe, too, that the stately Moor who is in that corridor is
King Marsilio of Sansueña, who, having seen the Moor’s insolence, at
once orders him (though his kinsman and a great favourite of his) to be
seized and given two hundred lashes, while carried through the streets of
the city according to custom, with criers going before him and officers of
justice behind; and here you see them come out to execute the sentence,
although the offence has been scarcely committed; for among the Moors
there are no indictments nor remands as with us.”
</p>
<p>
Here Don Quixote called out, “Child, child, go straight on with your
story, and don’t run into curves and slants, for to establish a fact
clearly there is need of a great deal of proof and confirmation;”
and said Master Pedro from within, “Boy, stick to your text and do
as the gentleman bids you; it’s the best plan; keep to your plain
song, and don’t attempt harmonies, for they are apt to break down
from being over fine.”
</p>
<p>
“I will,” said the boy, and he went on to say, “This
figure that you see here on horseback, covered with a Gascon cloak, is Don
Gaiferos himself, whom his wife, now avenged of the insult of the amorous
Moor, and taking her stand on the balcony of the tower with a calmer and
more tranquil countenance, has perceived without recognising him; and she
addresses her husband, supposing him to be some traveller, and holds with
him all that conversation and colloquy in the ballad that runs—
</p>
<p class="poem">
If you, sir knight, to France are bound,<br>
Oh! for Gaiferos ask—
</p>
<p class="noindent">
which I do not repeat here because prolixity begets disgust; suffice it to
observe how Don Gaiferos discovers himself, and that by her joyful
gestures Melisendra shows us she has recognised him; and what is more, we
now see she lowers herself from the balcony to place herself on the
haunches of her good husband’s horse. But ah! unhappy lady, the edge
of her petticoat has caught on one of the bars of the balcony and she is
left hanging in the air, unable to reach the ground. But you see how
compassionate heaven sends aid in our sorest need; Don Gaiferos advances,
and without minding whether the rich petticoat is torn or not, he seizes
her and by force brings her to the ground, and then with one jerk places
her on the haunches of his horse, astraddle like a man, and bids her hold
on tight and clasp her arms round his neck, crossing them on his breast so
as not to fall, for the lady Melisendra was not used to that style of
riding. You see, too, how the neighing of the horse shows his satisfaction
with the gallant and beautiful burden he bears in his lord and lady. You
see how they wheel round and quit the city, and in joy and gladness take
the road to Paris. Go in peace, O peerless pair of true lovers! May you
reach your longed-for fatherland in safety, and may fortune interpose no
impediment to your prosperous journey; may the eyes of your friends and
kinsmen behold you enjoying in peace and tranquillity the remaining days
of your life—and that they may be as many as those of Nestor!”
</p>
<p>
Here Master Pedro called out again and said, “Simplicity, boy! None
of your high flights; all affectation is bad.”
</p>
<p>
The interpreter made no answer, but went on to say, “There was no
want of idle eyes, that see everything, to see Melisendra come down and
mount, and word was brought to King Marsilio, who at once gave orders to
sound the alarm; and see what a stir there is, and how the city is drowned
with the sound of the bells pealing in the towers of all the mosques.”
</p>
<p>
“Nay, nay,” said Don Quixote at this; “on that point of
the bells Master Pedro is very inaccurate, for bells are not in use among
the Moors; only kettledrums, and a kind of small trumpet somewhat like our
clarion; to ring bells this way in Sansueña is unquestionably a great
absurdity.”
</p>
<p>
On hearing this, Master Pedro stopped ringing, and said, “Don’t
look into trifles, Señor Don Quixote, or want to have things up to a pitch
of perfection that is out of reach. Are there not almost every day a
thousand comedies represented all round us full of thousands of
inaccuracies and absurdities, and, for all that, they have a successful
run, and are listened to not only with applause, but with admiration and
all the rest of it? Go on, boy, and don’t mind; for so long as I
fill my pouch, no matter if I show as many inaccuracies as there are motes
in a sunbeam.”
</p>
<p>
“True enough,” said Don Quixote; and the boy went on: “See
what a numerous and glittering crowd of horsemen issues from the city in
pursuit of the two faithful lovers, what a blowing of trumpets there is,
what sounding of horns, what beating of drums and tabors; I fear me they
will overtake them and bring them back tied to the tail of their own
horse, which would be a dreadful sight.”

</p>
<p>
Don Quixote, however, seeing such a swarm of Moors and hearing such a din,
thought it would be right to aid the fugitives, and standing up he
exclaimed in a loud voice, “Never, while I live, will I permit foul
play to be practised in my presence on such a famous knight and fearless
lover as Don Gaiferos. Halt! ill-born rabble, follow him not nor pursue
him, or ye will have to reckon with me in battle!” and suiting the
action to the word, he drew his sword, and with one bound placed himself
close to the show, and with unexampled rapidity and fury began to shower
down blows on the puppet troop of Moors, knocking over some, decapitating
others, maiming this one and demolishing that; and among many more he
delivered one down stroke which, if Master Pedro had not ducked, made
himself small, and got out of the way, would have sliced off his head as
easily as if it had been made of almond-paste. Master Pedro kept shouting,
“Hold hard! Señor Don Quixote! can’t you see they’re not
real Moors you’re knocking down and killing and destroying, but only
little pasteboard figures! Look—sinner that I am!—how you’re
wrecking and ruining all that I’m worth!” But in spite of
this, Don Quixote did not leave off discharging a continuous rain of cuts,
slashes, downstrokes, and backstrokes, and at length, in less than the
space of two credos, he brought the whole show to the ground, with all its
fittings and figures shivered and knocked to pieces, King Marsilio badly
wounded, and the Emperor Charlemagne with his crown and head split in two.
The whole audience was thrown into confusion, the ape fled to the roof of
the inn, the cousin was frightened, and even Sancho Panza himself was in
mighty fear, for, as he swore after the storm was over, he had never seen
his master in such a furious passion.
</p>
<p>
The complete destruction of the show being thus accomplished, Don Quixote
became a little calmer, said, “I wish I had here before me now all
those who do not or will not believe how useful knights-errant are in the
world; just think, if I had not been here present, what would have become
of the brave Don Gaiferos and the fair Melisendra! Depend upon it, by this
time those dogs would have overtaken them and inflicted some outrage upon
them. So, then, long live knight-errantry beyond everything living on
earth this day!”
</p>
<p>
“Let it live, and welcome,” said Master Pedro at this in a
feeble voice, “and let me die, for I am so unfortunate that I can
say with King Don Rodrigo—
</p>
<p class="poem">
Yesterday was I lord of Spain<br>
To-day I’ve not a turret left<br>
That I may call mine own.
</p>
<p>
Not half an hour, nay, barely a minute ago, I saw myself lord of kings and
emperors, with my stables filled with countless horses, and my trunks and
bags with gay dresses unnumbered; and now I find myself ruined and laid
low, destitute and a beggar, and above all without my ape, for, by my
faith, my teeth will have to sweat for it before I have him caught; and
all through the reckless fury of sir knight here, who, they say, protects
the fatherless, and rights wrongs, and does other charitable deeds; but
whose generous intentions have been found wanting in my case only, blessed
and praised be the highest heavens! Verily, knight of the rueful figure he
must be to have disfigured mine.”
</p>
<p>
Sancho Panza was touched by Master Pedro’s words, and said to him,
“Don’t weep and lament, Master Pedro; you break my heart; let
me tell you my master, Don Quixote, is so catholic and scrupulous a
Christian that, if he can make out that he has done you any wrong, he will
own it, and be willing to pay for it and make it good, and something over
and above.”
</p>
<p>
“Only let Señor Don Quixote pay me for some part of the work he has
destroyed,” said Master Pedro, “and I would be content, and
his worship would ease his conscience, for he cannot be saved who keeps
what is another’s against the owner’s will, and makes no
restitution.”
</p>
<p>
“That is true,” said Don Quixote; “but at present I am
not aware that I have got anything of yours, Master Pedro.”
</p>
<p>
“What!” returned Master Pedro; “and these relics lying
here on the bare hard ground—what scattered and shattered them but
the invincible strength of that mighty arm? And whose were the bodies they
belonged to but mine? And what did I get my living by but by them?”
</p>
<p>
“Now am I fully convinced,” said Don Quixote, “of what I
had many a time before believed; that the enchanters who persecute me do
nothing more than put figures like these before my eyes, and then change
and turn them into what they please. In truth and earnest, I assure you
gentlemen who now hear me, that to me everything that has taken place here
seemed to take place literally, that Melisendra was Melisendra, Don
Gaiferos Don Gaiferos, Marsilio Marsilio, and Charlemagne Charlemagne.
That was why my anger was roused; and to be faithful to my calling as a
knight-errant I sought to give aid and protection to those who fled, and
with this good intention I did what you have seen. If the result has been
the opposite of what I intended, it is no fault of mine, but of those
wicked beings that persecute me; but, for all that, I am willing to
condemn myself in costs for this error of mine, though it did not proceed
from malice; let Master Pedro see what he wants for the spoiled figures,
for I agree to pay it at once in good and current money of Castile.”
</p>
<p>
Master Pedro made him a bow, saying, “I expected no less of the rare
Christianity of the valiant Don Quixote of La Mancha, true helper and
protector of all destitute and needy vagabonds; master landlord here and
the great Sancho Panza shall be the arbitrators and appraisers between
your worship and me of what these dilapidated figures are worth or may be
worth.”
</p>
<p>
The landlord and Sancho consented, and then Master Pedro picked up from
the ground King Marsilio of Saragossa with his head off, and said, “Here
you see how impossible it is to restore this king to his former state, so
I think, saving your better judgments, that for his death, decease, and
demise, four reals and a half may be given me.”
</p>
<p>
“Proceed,” said Don Quixote.
</p>
<p>
“Well then, for this cleavage from top to bottom,” continued
Master Pedro, taking up the split Emperor Charlemagne, “it would not
be much if I were to ask five reals and a quarter.”
</p>
<p>
“It’s not little,” said Sancho.
</p>
<p>
“Nor is it much,” said the landlord; “make it even, and
say five reals.”
</p>
<p>
“Let him have the whole five and a quarter,” said Don Quixote;
“for the sum total of this notable disaster does not stand on a
quarter more or less; and make an end of it quickly, Master Pedro, for it’s
getting on to supper-time, and I have some hints of hunger.”
</p>
<p>
“For this figure,” said Master Pedro, “that is without a
nose, and wants an eye, and is the fair Melisendra, I ask, and I am
reasonable in my charge, two reals and twelve maravedis.”
</p>
<p>
“The very devil must be in it,” said Don Quixote, “if
Melisendra and her husband are not by this time at least on the French
border, for the horse they rode on seemed to me to fly rather than gallop;
so you needn’t try to sell me the cat for the hare, showing me here
a noseless Melisendra when she is now, may be, enjoying herself at her
ease with her husband in France. God help every one to his own, Master
Pedro, and let us all proceed fairly and honestly; and now go on.”
</p>
<p>
Master Pedro, perceiving that Don Quixote was beginning to wander, and
return to his original fancy, was not disposed to let him escape, so he
said to him, “This cannot be Melisendra, but must be one of the
damsels that waited on her; so if I’m given sixty maravedis for her,
I’ll be content and sufficiently paid.”
</p>
<p>
And so he went on, putting values on ever so many more smashed figures,
which, after the two arbitrators had adjusted them to the satisfaction of
both parties, came to forty reals and three-quarters; and over and above
this sum, which Sancho at once disbursed, Master Pedro asked for two reals
for his trouble in catching the ape.
</p>
<p>
“Let him have them, Sancho,” said Don Quixote; “not to
catch the ape, but to get drunk; and two hundred would I give this minute
for the good news, to anyone who could tell me positively, that the lady
Doña Melisandra and Señor Don Gaiferos were now in France and with their
own people.”
</p>
<p>
“No one could tell us that better than my ape,” said Master
Pedro; “but there’s no devil that could catch him now; I
suspect, however, that affection and hunger will drive him to come looking
for me to-night; but to-morrow will soon be here and we shall see.”
</p>
<p>
In short, the puppet-show storm passed off, and all supped in peace and
good fellowship at Don Quixote’s expense, for he was the height of
generosity. Before it was daylight the man with the lances and halberds
took his departure, and soon after daybreak the cousin and the page came
to bid Don Quixote farewell, the former returning home, the latter
resuming his journey, towards which, to help him, Don Quixote gave him
twelve reals. Master Pedro did not care to engage in any more palaver with
Don Quixote, whom he knew right well; so he rose before the sun, and
having got together the remains of his show and caught his ape, he too
went off to seek his adventures. The landlord, who did not know Don
Quixote, was as much astonished at his mad freaks as at his generosity. To
conclude, Sancho, by his master’s orders, paid him very liberally,
and taking leave of him they quitted the inn at about eight in the morning
and took to the road, where we will leave them to pursue their journey,
for this is necessary in order to allow certain other matters to be set
forth, which are required to clear up this famous history.

<p>
Cide Hamete, the chronicler of this great history, begins this chapter
with these words, “I swear as a Catholic Christian;” with
regard to which his translator says that Cide Hamete’s swearing as a
Catholic Christian, he being—as no doubt he was—a Moor, only
meant that, just as a Catholic Christian taking an oath swears, or ought
to swear, what is true, and tell the truth in what he avers, so he was
telling the truth, as much as if he swore as a Catholic Christian, in all
he chose to write about Quixote, especially in declaring who Master Pedro
was and what was the divining ape that astonished all the villages with
his divinations. He says, then, that he who has read the First Part of
this history will remember well enough the Gines de Pasamonte whom, with
other galley slaves, Don Quixote set free in the Sierra Morena: a kindness
for which he afterwards got poor thanks and worse payment from that
evil-minded, ill-conditioned set. This Gines de Pasamonte—Don
Ginesillo de Parapilla, Don Quixote called him—it was that stole
Dapple from Sancho Panza; which, because by the fault of the printers
neither the how nor the when was stated in the First Part, has been a
puzzle to a good many people, who attribute to the bad memory of the
author what was the error of the press. In fact, however, Gines stole him
while Sancho Panza was asleep on his back, adopting the plan and device
that Brunello had recourse to when he stole Sacripante’s horse from
between his legs at the siege of Albracca; and, as has been told, Sancho
afterwards recovered him. This Gines, then, afraid of being caught by the
officers of justice, who were looking for him to punish him for his
numberless rascalities and offences (which were so many and so great that
he himself wrote a big book giving an account of them), resolved to shift
his quarters into the kingdom of Aragon, and cover up his left eye, and
take up the trade of a puppet-showman; for this, as well as juggling, he
knew how to practise to perfection. From some released Christians
returning from Barbary, it so happened, he bought the ape, which he taught
to mount upon his shoulder on his making a certain sign, and to whisper,
or seem to do so, in his ear. Thus prepared, before entering any village
whither he was bound with his show and his ape, he used to inform himself
at the nearest village, or from the most likely person he could find, as
to what particular things had happened there, and to whom; and bearing
them well in mind, the first thing he did was to exhibit his show,
sometimes one story, sometimes another, but all lively, amusing, and
familiar. As soon as the exhibition was over he brought forward the
accomplishments of his ape, assuring the public that he divined all the
past and the present, but as to the future he had no skill. For each
question answered he asked two reals, and for some he made a reduction,
just as he happened to feel the pulse of the questioners; and when now and
then he came to houses where things that he knew of had happened to the
people living there, even if they did not ask him a question, not caring
to pay for it, he would make the sign to the ape and then declare that it
had said so and so, which fitted the case exactly. In this way he acquired
a prodigious name and all ran after him; on other occasions, being very
crafty, he would answer in such a way that the answers suited the
questions; and as no one cross-questioned him or pressed him to tell how
his ape divined, he made fools of them all and filled his pouch. The
instant he entered the inn he knew Don Quixote and Sancho, and with that
knowledge it was easy for him to astonish them and all who were there; but
it would have cost him dear had Don Quixote brought down his hand a little
lower when he cut off King Marsilio’s head and destroyed all his
horsemen, as related in the preceeding chapter.
</p>
<p>
So much for Master Pedro and his ape; and now to return to Don Quixote of
La Mancha. After he had left the inn he determined to visit, first of all,
the banks of the Ebro and that neighbourhood, before entering the city of
Saragossa, for the ample time there was still to spare before the jousts
left him enough for all. With this object in view he followed the road and
travelled along it for two days, without meeting any adventure worth
committing to writing until on the third day, as he was ascending a hill,
he heard a great noise of drums, trumpets, and musket-shots. At first he
imagined some regiment of soldiers was passing that way, and to see them
he spurred Rocinante and mounted the hill. On reaching the top he saw at
the foot of it over two hundred men, as it seemed to him, armed with
weapons of various sorts, lances, crossbows, partisans, halberds, and
pikes, and a few muskets and a great many bucklers. He descended the slope
and approached the band near enough to see distinctly the flags, make out
the colours and distinguish the devices they bore, especially one on a
standard or ensign of white satin, on which there was painted in a very
life-like style an ass like a little sard, with its head up, its mouth
open and its tongue out, as if it were in the act and attitude of braying;
and round it were inscribed in large characters these two lines—
</p>
<p class="poem">
They did not bray in vain,<br>
Our alcaldes twain.
</p>
<p>
From this device Don Quixote concluded that these people must be from the
braying town, and he said so to Sancho, explaining to him what was written
on the standard. At the same time be observed that the man who had told
them about the matter was wrong in saying that the two who brayed were
regidors, for according to the lines of the standard they were alcaldes.
To which Sancho replied, “Señor, there’s nothing to stick at
in that, for maybe the regidors who brayed then came to be alcaldes of
their town afterwards, and so they may go by both titles; moreover, it has
nothing to do with the truth of the story whether the brayers were
alcaldes or regidors, provided at any rate they did bray; for an alcalde
is just as likely to bray as a regidor.” They perceived, in short,
clearly that the town which had been twitted had turned out to do battle
with some other that had jeered it more than was fair or neighbourly.
</p>
<p>
Don Quixote proceeded to join them, not a little to Sancho’s
uneasiness, for he never relished mixing himself up in expeditions of that
sort. The members of the troop received him into the midst of them, taking
him to be someone who was on their side. Don Quixote, putting up his
visor, advanced with an easy bearing and demeanour to the standard with
the ass, and all the chief men of the army gathered round him to look at
him, staring at him with the usual amazement that everybody felt on seeing
him for the first time. Don Quixote, seeing them examining him so
attentively, and that none of them spoke to him or put any question to
him, determined to take advantage of their silence; so, breaking his own,
he lifted up his voice and said, “Worthy sirs, I entreat you as
earnestly as I can not to interrupt an argument I wish to address to you,
until you find it displeases or wearies you; and if that come to pass, on
the slightest hint you give me I will put a seal upon my lips and a gag
upon my tongue.”
</p>
<p>
They all bade him say what he liked, for they would listen to him
willingly.

<p>
With this permission Don Quixote went on to say, “I, sirs, am a
knight-errant whose calling is that of arms, and whose profession is to
protect those who require protection, and give help to such as stand in
need of it. Some days ago I became acquainted with your misfortune and the
cause which impels you to take up arms again and again to revenge
yourselves upon your enemies; and having many times thought over your
business in my mind, I find that, according to the laws of combat, you are
mistaken in holding yourselves insulted; for a private individual cannot
insult an entire community; unless it be by defying it collectively as a
traitor, because he cannot tell who in particular is guilty of the treason
for which he defies it. Of this we have an example in Don Diego Ordoñez de
Lara, who defied the whole town of Zamora, because he did not know that
Vellido Dolfos alone had committed the treachery of slaying his king; and
therefore he defied them all, and the vengeance and the reply concerned
all; though, to be sure, Señor Don Diego went rather too far, indeed very
much beyond the limits of a defiance; for he had no occasion to defy the
dead, or the waters, or the fishes, or those yet unborn, and all the rest
of it as set forth; but let that pass, for when anger breaks out there’s
no father, governor, or bridle to check the tongue. The case being, then,
that no one person can insult a kingdom, province, city, state, or entire
community, it is clear there is no reason for going out to avenge the
defiance of such an insult, inasmuch as it is not one. A fine thing it
would be if the people of the clock town were to be at loggerheads every
moment with everyone who called them by that name,—or the Cazoleros,
Berengeneros, Ballenatos, Jaboneros, or the bearers of all the other names
and titles that are always in the mouth of the boys and common people! It
would be a nice business indeed if all these illustrious cities were to
take huff and revenge themselves and go about perpetually making trombones
of their swords in every petty quarrel! No, no; God forbid! There are four
things for which sensible men and well-ordered States ought to take up
arms, draw their swords, and risk their persons, lives, and properties.
The first is to defend the Catholic faith; the second, to defend one’s
life, which is in accordance with natural and divine law; the third, in
defence of one’s honour, family, and property; the fourth, in the
service of one’s king in a just war; and if to these we choose to
add a fifth (which may be included in the second), in defence of one’s
country. To these five, as it were capital causes, there may be added some
others that may be just and reasonable, and make it a duty to take up
arms; but to take them up for trifles and things to laugh at and be amused
by rather than offended, looks as though he who did so was altogether
wanting in common sense. Moreover, to take an unjust revenge (and there
cannot be any just one) is directly opposed to the sacred law that we
acknowledge, wherein we are commanded to do good to our enemies and to
love them that hate us; a command which, though it seems somewhat
difficult to obey, is only so to those who have in them less of God than
of the world, and more of the flesh than of the spirit; for Jesus Christ,
God and true man, who never lied, and could not and cannot lie, said, as
our law-giver, that his yoke was easy and his burden light; he would not,
therefore, have laid any command upon us that it was impossible to obey.
Thus, sirs, you are bound to keep quiet by human and divine law.”
</p>
<p>
“The devil take me,” said Sancho to himself at this, “but
this master of mine is a theologian; or, if not, faith, he’s as like
one as one egg is like another.”
</p>
<p>
Don Quixote stopped to take breath, and, observing that silence was still
preserved, had a mind to continue his discourse, and would have done so
had not Sancho interposed with his smartness; for he, seeing his master
pause, took the lead, saying, “My lord Don Quixote of La Mancha, who
once was called the Knight of the Rueful Countenance, but now is called
the Knight of the Lions, is a gentleman of great discretion who knows
Latin and his mother tongue like a bachelor, and in everything that he
deals with or advises proceeds like a good soldier, and has all the laws
and ordinances of what they call combat at his fingers’ ends; so you
have nothing to do but to let yourselves be guided by what he says, and on
my head be it if it is wrong. Besides which, you have been told that it is
folly to take offence at merely hearing a bray. I remember when I was a
boy I brayed as often as I had a fancy, without anyone hindering me, and
so elegantly and naturally that when I brayed all the asses in the town
would bray; but I was none the less for that the son of my parents who
were greatly respected; and though I was envied because of the gift by
more than one of the high and mighty ones of the town, I did not care two
farthings for it; and that you may see I am telling the truth, wait a bit
and listen, for this art, like swimming, once learnt is never forgotten;”
and then, taking hold of his nose, he began to bray so vigorously that all
the valleys around rang again.
</p>
<p>
One of those, however, that stood near him, fancying he was mocking them,
lifted up a long staff he had in his hand and smote him such a blow with
it that Sancho dropped helpless to the ground. Don Quixote, seeing him so
roughly handled, attacked the man who had struck him lance in hand, but so
many thrust themselves between them that he could not avenge him. Far from
it, finding a shower of stones rained upon him, and crossbows and muskets
unnumbered levelled at him, he wheeled Rocinante round and, as fast as his
best gallop could take him, fled from the midst of them, commending
himself to God with all his heart to deliver him out of this peril, in
dread every step of some ball coming in at his back and coming out at his
breast, and every minute drawing his breath to see whether it had gone
from him. The members of the band, however, were satisfied with seeing him
take to flight, and did not fire on him. They put up Sancho, scarcely
restored to his senses, on his ass, and let him go after his master; not
that he was sufficiently in his wits to guide the beast, but Dapple
followed the footsteps of Rocinante, from whom he could not remain a
moment separated. Don Quixote having got some way off looked back, and
seeing Sancho coming, waited for him, as he perceived that no one followed
him. The men of the troop stood their ground till night, and as the enemy
did not come out to battle, they returned to their town exulting; and had
they been aware of the ancient custom of the Greeks, they would have
erected a trophy on the spot.

<p>
When the brave man flees, treachery is manifest and it is for wise men to
reserve themselves for better occasions. This proved to be the case with
Don Quixote, who, giving way before the fury of the townsfolk and the
hostile intentions of the angry troop, took to flight and, without a
thought of Sancho or the danger in which he was leaving him, retreated to
such a distance as he thought made him safe. Sancho, lying across his ass,
followed him, as has been said, and at length came up, having by this time
recovered his senses, and on joining him let himself drop off Dapple at
Rocinante’s feet, sore, bruised, and belaboured. Don Quixote
dismounted to examine his wounds, but finding him whole from head to foot,
he said to him, angrily enough, “In an evil hour didst thou take to
braying, Sancho! Where hast thou learned that it is well done to mention
the rope in the house of the man that has been hanged? To the music of
brays what harmonies couldst thou expect to get but cudgels? Give thanks
to God, Sancho, that they signed the cross on thee just now with a stick,
and did not mark thee <i>per signum crucis</i> with a cutlass.”
</p>
<p>
“I’m not equal to answering,” said Sancho, “for I
feel as if I was speaking through my shoulders; let us mount and get away
from this; I’ll keep from braying, but not from saying that
knights-errant fly and leave their good squires to be pounded like privet,
or made meal of at the hands of their enemies.”
</p>
<p>
“He does not fly who retires,” returned Don Quixote; “for
I would have thee know, Sancho, that the valour which is not based upon a
foundation of prudence is called rashness, and the exploits of the rash
man are to be attributed rather to good fortune than to courage; and so I
own that I retired, but not that I fled; and therein I have followed the
example of many valiant men who have reserved themselves for better times;
the histories are full of instances of this, but as it would not be any
good to thee or pleasure to me, I will not recount them to thee now.”
</p>
<p>
Sancho was by this time mounted with the help of Don Quixote, who then
himself mounted Rocinante, and at a leisurely pace they proceeded to take
shelter in a grove which was in sight about a quarter of a league off.
Every now and then Sancho gave vent to deep sighs and dismal groans, and
on Don Quixote asking him what caused such acute suffering, he replied
that, from the end of his back-bone up to the nape of his neck, he was so
sore that it nearly drove him out of his senses.
</p>
<p>
“The cause of that soreness,” said Don Quixote, “will
be, no doubt, that the staff wherewith they smote thee being a very long
one, it caught thee all down the back, where all the parts that are sore
are situated, and had it reached any further thou wouldst be sorer still.”
</p>
<p>
“By God,” said Sancho, “your worship has relieved me of
a great doubt, and cleared up the point for me in elegant style! Body o’
me! is the cause of my soreness such a mystery that there’s any need
to tell me I am sore everywhere the staff hit me? If it was my ankles that
pained me there might be something in going divining why they did, but it
is not much to divine that I’m sore where they thrashed me. By my
faith, master mine, the ills of others hang by a hair; every day I am
discovering more and more how little I have to hope for from keeping
company with your worship; for if this time you have allowed me to be
drubbed, the next time, or a hundred times more, we’ll have the
blanketings of the other day over again, and all the other pranks which,
if they have fallen on my shoulders now, will be thrown in my teeth
by-and-by. I would do a great deal better (if I was not an ignorant brute
that will never do any good all my life), I would do a great deal better,
I say, to go home to my wife and children and support them and bring them
up on what God may please to give me, instead of following your worship
along roads that lead nowhere and paths that are none at all, with little
to drink and less to eat. And then when it comes to sleeping! Measure out
seven feet on the earth, brother squire, and if that’s not enough
for you, take as many more, for you may have it all your own way and
stretch yourself to your heart’s content. Oh that I could see burnt
and turned to ashes the first man that meddled with knight-errantry or at
any rate the first who chose to be squire to such fools as all the
knights-errant of past times must have been! Of those of the present day I
say nothing, because, as your worship is one of them, I respect them, and
because I know your worship knows a point more than the devil in all you
say and think.”
</p>
<p>
“I would lay a good wager with you, Sancho,” said Don Quixote,
“that now that you are talking on without anyone to stop you, you
don’t feel a pain in your whole body. Talk away, my son, say
whatever comes into your head or mouth, for so long as you feel no pain,
the irritation your impertinences give me will be a pleasure to me; and if
you are so anxious to go home to your wife and children, God forbid that I
should prevent you; you have money of mine; see how long it is since we
left our village this third time, and how much you can and ought to earn
every month, and pay yourself out of your own hand.”
</p>
<p>
“When I worked for Tom Carrasco, the father of the bachelor Samson
Carrasco that your worship knows,” replied Sancho, “I used to
earn two ducats a month besides my food; I can’t tell what I can
earn with your worship, though I know a knight-errant’s squire has
harder times of it than he who works for a farmer; for after all, we who
work for farmers, however much we toil all day, at the worst, at night, we
have our olla supper and sleep in a bed, which I have not slept in since I
have been in your worship’s service, if it wasn’t the short
time we were in Don Diego de Miranda’s house, and the feast I had
with the skimmings I took off Camacho’s pots, and what I ate, drank,
and slept in Basilio’s house; all the rest of the time I have been
sleeping on the hard ground under the open sky, exposed to what they call
the inclemencies of heaven, keeping life in me with scraps of cheese and
crusts of bread, and drinking water either from the brooks or from the
springs we come to on these by-paths we travel.”
</p>
<p>
“I own, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “that all thou sayest
is true; how much, thinkest thou, ought I to give thee over and above what
Tom Carrasco gave thee?”
</p>
<p>
“I think,” said Sancho, “that if your worship was to add
on two reals a month I’d consider myself well paid; that is, as far
as the wages of my labour go; but to make up to me for your worship’s
pledge and promise to me to give me the government of an island, it would
be fair to add six reals more, making thirty in all.”
</p>
<p>
“Very good,” said Don Quixote; “it is twenty-five days
since we left our village, so reckon up, Sancho, according to the wages
you have made out for yourself, and see how much I owe you in proportion,
and pay yourself, as I said before, out of your own hand.”
</p>
<p>
“O body o’ me!” said Sancho, “but your worship is
very much out in that reckoning; for when it comes to the promise of the
island we must count from the day your worship promised it to me to this
present hour we are at now.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, how long is it, Sancho, since I promised it to you?”
said Don Quixote.
</p>
<p>
“If I remember rightly,” said Sancho, “it must be over
twenty years, three days more or less.”
</p>
<p>
Don Quixote gave himself a great slap on the forehead and began to laugh
heartily, and said he, “Why, I have not been wandering, either in the
Sierra Morena or in the whole course of our sallies, but barely two months, and
thou sayest, Sancho, that it is twenty years since I promised thee the island.
I believe now thou wouldst have all the money thou hast of mine go in thy
wages. If so, and if that be thy pleasure, I give it to thee now, once and for
all, and much good may it do thee, for so long as I see myself rid of such a
good-for-nothing squire I’ll be glad to be left a pauper without a rap.
But tell me, thou perverter of the squirely rules of knight-errantry, where
hast thou ever seen or read that any knight-errant’s squire made terms
with his lord, ‘you must give me so much a month for serving you’?
Plunge, scoundrel, rogue, monster—for such I take thee to
be—plunge, I say, into the <i>mare magnum</i> of their histories; and if
thou shalt find that any squire ever said or thought what thou hast said now, I
will let thee nail it on my forehead, and give me, over and above, four sound
slaps in the face. Turn the rein, or the halter, of thy Dapple, and begone
home; for one single step further thou shalt not make in my company. O bread
thanklessly received! O promises ill-bestowed! O man more beast than human
being! Now, when I was about to raise thee to such a position, that, in spite
of thy wife, they would call thee ‘my lord,’ thou art leaving me?
Thou art going now when I had a firm and fixed intention of making thee lord of
the best island in the world? Well, as thou thyself hast said before now, honey
is not for the mouth of the ass. Ass thou art, ass thou wilt be, and ass thou
wilt end when the course of thy life is run; for I know it will come to its
close before thou dost perceive or discern that thou art a beast.”
</p>
<p>
Sancho regarded Don Quixote earnestly while he was giving him this rating,
and was so touched by remorse that the tears came to his eyes, and in a
piteous and broken voice he said to him, “Master mine, I confess
that, to be a complete ass, all I want is a tail; if your worship will
only fix one on to me, I’ll look on it as rightly placed, and I’ll
serve you as an ass all the remaining days of my life. Forgive me and have
pity on my folly, and remember I know but little, and, if I talk much, it’s
more from infirmity than malice; but he who sins and mends commends
himself to God.”
</p>
<p>
“I should have been surprised, Sancho,” said Don Quixote,
“if thou hadst not introduced some bit of a proverb into thy speech.
Well, well, I forgive thee, provided thou dost mend and not show thyself
in future so fond of thine own interest, but try to be of good cheer and
take heart, and encourage thyself to look forward to the fulfillment of my
promises, which, by being delayed, does not become impossible.”
</p>
<p>
Sancho said he would do so, and keep up his heart as best he could. They
then entered the grove, and Don Quixote settled himself at the foot of an
elm, and Sancho at that of a beech, for trees of this kind and others like
them always have feet but no hands. Sancho passed the night in pain, for
with the evening dews the blow of the staff made itself felt all the more.
Don Quixote passed it in his never-failing meditations; but, for all that,
they had some winks of sleep, and with the appearance of daylight they
pursued their journey in quest of the banks of the famous Ebro, where that
befell them which will be told in the following chapter.

</p>
<p>
By stages as already described or left undescribed, two days after
quitting the grove Don Quixote and Sancho reached the river Ebro, and the
sight of it was a great delight to Don Quixote as he contemplated and
gazed upon the charms of its banks, the clearness of its stream, the
gentleness of its current and the abundance of its crystal waters; and the
pleasant view revived a thousand tender thoughts in his mind. Above all,
he dwelt upon what he had seen in the cave of Montesinos; for though
Master Pedro’s ape had told him that of those things part was true,
part false, he clung more to their truth than to their falsehood, the very
reverse of Sancho, who held them all to be downright lies.
</p>
<p>
As they were thus proceeding, then, they discovered a small boat, without
oars or any other gear, that lay at the water’s edge tied to the
stem of a tree growing on the bank. Don Quixote looked all round, and
seeing nobody, at once, without more ado, dismounted from Rocinante and
bade Sancho get down from Dapple and tie both beasts securely to the trunk
of a poplar or willow that stood there. Sancho asked him the reason of
this sudden dismounting and tying. Don Quixote made answer, “Thou
must know, Sancho, that this bark is plainly, and without the possibility
of any alternative, calling and inviting me to enter it, and in it go to
give aid to some knight or other person of distinction in need of it, who
is no doubt in some sore strait; for this is the way of the books of
chivalry and of the enchanters who figure and speak in them. When a knight
is involved in some difficulty from which he cannot be delivered save by
the hand of another knight, though they may be at a distance of two or
three thousand leagues or more one from the other, they either take him up
on a cloud, or they provide a bark for him to get into, and in less than
the twinkling of an eye they carry him where they will and where his help
is required; and so, Sancho, this bark is placed here for the same
purpose; this is as true as that it is now day, and ere this one passes
tie Dapple and Rocinante together, and then in God’s hand be it to
guide us; for I would not hold back from embarking, though barefooted
friars were to beg me.”
</p>
<p>
“As that’s the case,” said Sancho, “and your
worship chooses to give in to these—I don’t know if I may call
them absurdities—at every turn, there’s nothing for it but to
obey and bow the head, bearing in mind the proverb, ‘Do as thy
master bids thee, and sit down to table with him;’ but for all that,
for the sake of easing my conscience, I warn your worship that it is my
opinion this bark is no enchanted one, but belongs to some of the
fishermen of the river, for they catch the best shad in the world here.”
</p>
<p>
As Sancho said this, he tied the beasts, leaving them to the care and
protection of the enchanters with sorrow enough in his heart. Don Quixote
bade him not be uneasy about deserting the animals, “for he who
would carry themselves over such longinquous roads and regions would take
care to feed them.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t understand that logiquous,” said Sancho,
“nor have I ever heard the word all the days of my life.”
</p>
<p>
“Longinquous,” replied Don Quixote, “means far off; but
it is no wonder thou dost not understand it, for thou art not bound to
know Latin, like some who pretend to know it and don’t.”
</p>
<p>
“Now they are tied,” said Sancho; “what are we to do
next?”
</p>
<p>
“What?” said Don Quixote, “cross ourselves and weigh
anchor; I mean, embark and cut the moorings by which the bark is held;”
and the bark began to drift away slowly from the bank. But when Sancho saw
himself somewhere about two yards out in the river, he began to tremble
and give himself up for lost; but nothing distressed him more than hearing
Dapple bray and seeing Rocinante struggling to get loose, and said he to
his master, “Dapple is braying in grief at our leaving him, and
Rocinante is trying to escape and plunge in after us. O dear friends,
peace be with you, and may this madness that is taking us away from you,
turned into sober sense, bring us back to you.” And with this he
fell weeping so bitterly, that Don Quixote said to him, sharply and
angrily, “What art thou afraid of, cowardly creature? What art thou
weeping at, heart of butter-paste? Who pursues or molests thee, thou soul
of a tame mouse? What dost thou want, unsatisfied in the very heart of
abundance? Art thou, perchance, tramping barefoot over the Riphaean
mountains, instead of being seated on a bench like an archduke on the
tranquil stream of this pleasant river, from which in a short space we
shall come out upon the broad sea? But we must have already emerged and
gone seven hundred or eight hundred leagues; and if I had here an
astrolabe to take the altitude of the pole, I could tell thee how many we
have travelled, though either I know little, or we have already crossed or
shall shortly cross the equinoctial line which parts the two opposite
poles midway.”
</p>
<p>
“And when we come to that line your worship speaks of,” said
Sancho, “how far shall we have gone?”
</p>
<p>
“Very far,” said Don Quixote, “for of the three hundred
and sixty degrees that this terraqueous globe contains, as computed by
Ptolemy, the greatest cosmographer known, we shall have travelled one-half
when we come to the line I spoke of.”
</p>
<p>
“By God,” said Sancho, “your worship gives me a nice
authority for what you say, putrid Dolly something transmogrified, or
whatever it is.”
</p>
<p>
Don Quixote laughed at the interpretation Sancho put upon “computed,”
and the name of the cosmographer Ptolemy, and said he, “Thou must
know, Sancho, that with the Spaniards and those who embark at Cadiz for
the East Indies, one of the signs they have to show them when they have
passed the equinoctial line I told thee of, is, that the lice die upon
everybody on board the ship, and not a single one is left, or to be found
in the whole vessel if they gave its weight in gold for it; so, Sancho,
thou mayest as well pass thy hand down thy thigh, and if thou comest upon
anything alive we shall be no longer in doubt; if not, then we have
crossed.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t believe a bit of it,” said Sancho; “still,
I’ll do as your worship bids me; though I don’t know what need
there is for trying these experiments, for I can see with my own eyes that
we have not moved five yards away from the bank, or shifted two yards from
where the animals stand, for there are Rocinante and Dapple in the very
same place where we left them; and watching a point, as I do now, I swear
by all that’s good, we are not stirring or moving at the pace of an
ant.”
</p>
<p>
“Try the test I told thee of, Sancho,” said Don Quixote,
“and don’t mind any other, for thou knowest nothing about
colures, lines, parallels, zodiacs, ecliptics, poles, solstices,
equinoxes, planets, signs, bearings, the measures of which the celestial
and terrestrial spheres are composed; if thou wert acquainted with all
these things, or any portion of them, thou wouldst see clearly how many
parallels we have cut, what signs we have seen, and what constellations we
have left behind and are now leaving behind. But again I tell thee, feel
and hunt, for I am certain thou art cleaner than a sheet of smooth white
paper.”
</p>
<p>
Sancho felt, and passing his hand gently and carefully down to the hollow
of his left knee, he looked up at his master and said, “Either the
test is a false one, or we have not come to where your worship says, nor
within many leagues of it.”
</p>
<p>
“Why, how so?” asked Don Quixote; “hast thou come upon
aught?”
</p>
<p>
“Ay, and aughts,” replied Sancho; and shaking his fingers he
washed his whole hand in the river along which the boat was quietly
gliding in midstream, not moved by any occult intelligence or invisible
enchanter, but simply by the current, just there smooth and gentle.
</p>
<p>
They now came in sight of some large water mills that stood in the middle
of the river, and the instant Don Quixote saw them he cried out, “Seest
thou there, my friend? there stands the castle or fortress, where there
is, no doubt, some knight in durance, or ill-used queen, or infanta, or
princess, in whose aid I am brought hither.”
</p>
<p>
“What the devil city, fortress, or castle is your worship talking
about, señor?” said Sancho; “don’t you see that those
are mills that stand in the river to grind corn?”
</p>
<p>
“Hold thy peace, Sancho,” said Don Quixote; “though they
look like mills they are not so; I have already told thee that
enchantments transform things and change their proper shapes; I do not
mean to say they really change them from one form into another, but that
it seems as though they did, as experience proved in the transformation of
Dulcinea, sole refuge of my hopes.”
</p>
<p>
By this time, the boat, having reached the middle of the stream, began to
move less slowly than hitherto. The millers belonging to the mills, when
they saw the boat coming down the river, and on the point of being sucked
in by the draught of the wheels, ran out in haste, several of them, with
long poles to stop it, and being all mealy, with faces and garments
covered with flour, they presented a sinister appearance. They raised loud
shouts, crying, “Devils of men, where are you going to? Are you mad?
Do you want to drown yourselves, or dash yourselves to pieces among these
wheels?”
</p>
<p>
“Did I not tell thee, Sancho,” said Don Quixote at this,
“that we had reached the place where I am to show what the might of
my arm can do? See what ruffians and villains come out against me; see
what monsters oppose me; see what hideous countenances come to frighten
us! You shall soon see, scoundrels!” And then standing up in the
boat he began in a loud voice to hurl threats at the millers, exclaiming,
“Ill-conditioned and worse-counselled rabble, restore to liberty and
freedom the person ye hold in durance in this your fortress or prison,
high or low or of whatever rank or quality he be, for I am Don Quixote of
La Mancha, otherwise called the Knight of the Lions, for whom, by the
disposition of heaven above, it is reserved to give a happy issue to this
adventure;” and so saying he drew his sword and began making passes
in the air at the millers, who, hearing but not understanding all this
nonsense, strove to stop the boat, which was now getting into the rushing
channel of the wheels. Sancho fell upon his knees devoutly appealing to
heaven to deliver him from such imminent peril; which it did by the
activity and quickness of the millers, who, pushing against the boat with
their poles, stopped it, not, however, without upsetting and throwing Don
Quixote and Sancho into the water; and lucky it was for Don Quixote that
he could swim like a goose, though the weight of his armour carried him
twice to the bottom; and had it not been for the millers, who plunged in
and hoisted them both out, it would have been Troy town with the pair of
them. As soon as, more drenched than thirsty, they were landed, Sancho
went down on his knees and with clasped hands and eyes raised to heaven,
prayed a long and fervent prayer to God to deliver him evermore from the
rash projects and attempts of his master. The fishermen, the owners of the
boat, which the mill-wheels had knocked to pieces, now came up, and seeing
it smashed they proceeded to strip Sancho and to demand payment for it
from Don Quixote; but he with great calmness, just as if nothing had
happened him, told the millers and fishermen that he would pay for the
bark most cheerfully, on condition that they delivered up to him, free and
unhurt, the person or persons that were in durance in that castle of
theirs.

<p>
“What persons or what castle art thou talking of, madman? Art thou
for carrying off the people who come to grind corn in these mills?”
</p>
<p>
“That’s enough,” said Don Quixote to himself, “it
would be preaching in the desert to attempt by entreaties to induce this
rabble to do any virtuous action. In this adventure two mighty enchanters
must have encountered one another, and one frustrates what the other
attempts; one provided the bark for me, and the other upset me; God help
us, this world is all machinations and schemes at cross purposes one with
the other. I can do no more.” And then turning towards the mills he
said aloud, “Friends, whoe’er ye be that are immured in that
prison, forgive me that, to my misfortune and yours, I cannot deliver you
from your misery; this adventure is doubtless reserved and destined for
some other knight.”
</p>
<p>
So saying he settled with the fishermen, and paid fifty reals for the
boat, which Sancho handed to them very much against the grain, saying,
“With a couple more bark businesses like this we shall have sunk our
whole capital.”
</p>
<p>
The fishermen and the millers stood staring in amazement at the two
figures, so very different to all appearance from ordinary men, and were
wholly unable to make out the drift of the observations and questions Don
Quixote addressed to them; and coming to the conclusion that they were
madmen, they left them and betook themselves, the millers to their mills,
and the fishermen to their huts. Don Quixote and Sancho returned to their
beasts, and to their life of beasts, and so ended the adventure of the
enchanted bark.

<p>
They reached their beasts in low spirits and bad humour enough, knight and
squire, Sancho particularly, for with him what touched the stock of money
touched his heart, and when any was taken from him he felt as if he was
robbed of the apples of his eyes. In fine, without exchanging a word, they
mounted and quitted the famous river, Don Quixote absorbed in thoughts of
his love, Sancho in thinking of his advancement, which just then, it
seemed to him, he was very far from securing; for, fool as he was, he saw
clearly enough that his master’s acts were all or most of them
utterly senseless; and he began to cast about for an opportunity of
retiring from his service and going home some day, without entering into
any explanations or taking any farewell of him. Fortune, however, ordered
matters after a fashion very much the opposite of what he contemplated.
</p>
<p>
It so happened that the next day towards sunset, on coming out of a wood,
Don Quixote cast his eyes over a green meadow, and at the far end of it
observed some people, and as he drew nearer saw that it was a hawking
party. Coming closer, he distinguished among them a lady of graceful mien,
on a pure white palfrey or hackney caparisoned with green trappings and a
silver-mounted side-saddle. The lady was also in green, and so richly and
splendidly dressed that splendour itself seemed personified in her. On her
left hand she bore a hawk, a proof to Don Quixote’s mind that she
must be some great lady and the mistress of the whole hunting party, which
was the fact; so he said to Sancho, “Run Sancho, my son, and say to
that lady on the palfrey with the hawk that I, the Knight of the Lions,
kiss the hands of her exalted beauty, and if her excellence will grant me
leave I will go and kiss them in person and place myself at her service
for aught that may be in my power and her highness may command; and mind,
Sancho, how thou speakest, and take care not to thrust in any of thy
proverbs into thy message.”
</p>

</p>
<p>
“You’ve got a likely one here to thrust any in!” said
Sancho; “leave me alone for that! Why, this is not the first time in
my life I have carried messages to high and exalted ladies.”
</p>
<p>
“Except that thou didst carry to the lady Dulcinea,” said Don
Quixote, “I know not that thou hast carried any other, at least in
my service.”
</p>
<p>
“That is true,” replied Sancho; “but pledges don’t
distress a good payer, and in a house where there’s plenty supper is
soon cooked; I mean there’s no need of telling or warning me about
anything; for I’m ready for everything and know a little of
everything.”
</p>
<p>
“That I believe, Sancho,” said Don Quixote; “go and good
luck to thee, and God speed thee.”
</p>
<p>
Sancho went off at top speed, forcing Dapple out of his regular pace, and
came to where the fair huntress was standing, and dismounting knelt before
her and said, “Fair lady, that knight that you see there, the Knight
of the Lions by name, is my master, and I am a squire of his, and at home
they call me Sancho Panza. This same Knight of the Lions, who was called
not long since the Knight of the Rueful Countenance, sends by me to say
may it please your highness to give him leave that, with your permission,
approbation, and consent, he may come and carry out his wishes, which are,
as he says and I believe, to serve your exalted loftiness and beauty; and
if you give it, your ladyship will do a thing which will redound to your
honour, and he will receive a most distinguished favour and happiness.”
</p>
<p>
“You have indeed, squire,” said the lady, “delivered
your message with all the formalities such messages require; rise up, for
it is not right that the squire of a knight so great as he of the Rueful
Countenance, of whom we have heard a great deal here, should remain on his
knees; rise, my friend, and bid your master welcome to the services of
myself and the duke my husband, in a country house we have here.”
</p>
<p>
Sancho got up, charmed as much by the beauty of the good lady as by her
high-bred air and her courtesy, but, above all, by what she had said about
having heard of his master, the Knight of the Rueful Countenance; for if
she did not call him Knight of the Lions it was no doubt because he had so
lately taken the name. “Tell me, brother squire,” asked the
duchess (whose title, however, is not known), “this master of yours,
is he not one of whom there is a history extant in print, called ‘The
Ingenious Gentleman, Don Quixote of La Mancha,’ who has for the lady
of his heart a certain Dulcinea del Toboso?”
</p>
<p>
“He is the same, señora,” replied Sancho; “and that
squire of his who figures, or ought to figure, in the said history under
the name of Sancho Panza, is myself, unless they have changed me in the
cradle, I mean in the press.”
</p>
<p>
“I am rejoiced at all this,” said the duchess; “go,
brother Panza, and tell your master that he is welcome to my estate, and
that nothing could happen to me that could give me greater pleasure.”
</p>
<p>
Sancho returned to his master mightily pleased with this gratifying
answer, and told him all the great lady had said to him, lauding to the
skies, in his rustic phrase, her rare beauty, her graceful gaiety, and her
courtesy. Don Quixote drew himself up briskly in his saddle, fixed himself
in his stirrups, settled his visor, gave Rocinante the spur, and with an
easy bearing advanced to kiss the hands of the duchess, who, having sent
to summon the duke her husband, told him while Don Quixote was approaching
all about the message; and as both of them had read the First Part of this
history, and from it were aware of Don Quixote’s crazy turn, they
awaited him with the greatest delight and anxiety to make his
acquaintance, meaning to fall in with his humour and agree with everything
he said, and, so long as he stayed with them, to treat him as a
knight-errant, with all the ceremonies usual in the books of chivalry they
had read, for they themselves were very fond of them.
</p>
<p>
Don Quixote now came up with his visor raised, and as he seemed about to
dismount Sancho made haste to go and hold his stirrup for him; but in
getting down off Dapple he was so unlucky as to hitch his foot in one of
the ropes of the pack-saddle in such a way that he was unable to free it,
and was left hanging by it with his face and breast on the ground. Don
Quixote, who was not used to dismount without having the stirrup held,
fancying that Sancho had by this time come to hold it for him, threw
himself off with a lurch and brought Rocinante’s saddle after him,
which was no doubt badly girthed, and saddle and he both came to the
ground; not without discomfiture to him and abundant curses muttered
between his teeth against the unlucky Sancho, who had his foot still in
the shackles. The duke ordered his huntsmen to go to the help of knight
and squire, and they raised Don Quixote, sorely shaken by his fall; and
he, limping, advanced as best he could to kneel before the noble pair.
This, however, the duke would by no means permit; on the contrary,
dismounting from his horse, he went and embraced Don Quixote, saying,
“I am grieved, Sir Knight of the Rueful Countenance, that your first
experience on my ground should have been such an unfortunate one as we
have seen; but the carelessness of squires is often the cause of worse
accidents.”
</p>
<p>
“That which has happened me in meeting you, mighty prince,”
replied Don Quixote, “cannot be unfortunate, even if my fall had not
stopped short of the depths of the bottomless pit, for the glory of having
seen you would have lifted me up and delivered me from it. My squire, God’s
curse upon him, is better at unloosing his tongue in talking impertinence
than in tightening the girths of a saddle to keep it steady; but however I
may be, fallen or raised up, on foot or on horseback, I shall always be at
your service and that of my lady the duchess, your worthy consort, worthy
queen of beauty and paramount princess of courtesy.”
</p>
<p>
“Gently, Señor Don Quixote of La Mancha,” said the duke;
“where my lady Doña Dulcinea del Toboso is, it is not right that
other beauties should be praised.”
</p>
<p>
Sancho, by this time released from his entanglement, was standing by, and
before his master could answer he said, “There is no denying, and it
must be maintained, that my lady Dulcinea del Toboso is very beautiful;
but the hare jumps up where one least expects it; and I have heard say
that what we call nature is like a potter that makes vessels of clay, and
he who makes one fair vessel can as well make two, or three, or a hundred;
I say so because, by my faith, my lady the duchess is in no way behind my
mistress the lady Dulcinea del Toboso.”
</p>
<p>
Don Quixote turned to the duchess and said, “Your highness may
conceive that never had knight-errant in this world a more talkative or a
droller squire than I have, and he will prove the truth of what I say, if
your highness is pleased to accept of my services for a few days.”
</p>
<p>
To which the duchess made answer, “that worthy Sancho is droll I
consider a very good thing, because it is a sign that he is shrewd; for
drollery and sprightliness, Señor Don Quixote, as you very well know, do
not take up their abode with dull wits; and as good Sancho is droll and
sprightly I here set him down as shrewd.”
</p>
<p>
“And talkative,” added Don Quixote.
</p>
<p>
“So much the better,” said the duke, “for many droll
things cannot be said in few words; but not to lose time in talking, come,
great Knight of the Rueful Countenance—”
</p>
<p>
“Of the Lions, your highness must say,” said Sancho, “for
there is no Rueful Countenance nor any such character now.”
</p>
<p>
“He of the Lions be it,” continued the duke; “I say, let
Sir Knight of the Lions come to a castle of mine close by, where he shall
be given that reception which is due to so exalted a personage, and which
the duchess and I are wont to give to all knights-errant who come there.”
</p>
<p>
By this time Sancho had fixed and girthed Rocinante’s saddle, and
Don Quixote having got on his back and the duke mounted a fine horse, they
placed the duchess in the middle and set out for the castle. The duchess
desired Sancho to come to her side, for she found infinite enjoyment in
listening to his shrewd remarks. Sancho required no pressing, but pushed
himself in between them and the duke, who thought it rare good fortune to
receive such a knight-errant and such a homely squire in their castle.

Supreme was the satisfaction that Sancho felt at seeing himself, as it
seemed, an established favourite with the duchess, for he looked forward
to finding in her castle what he had found in Don Diego’s house and
in Basilio’s; he was always fond of good living, and always seized
by the forelock any opportunity of feasting himself whenever it presented
itself. The history informs us, then, that before they reached the country
house or castle, the duke went on in advance and instructed all his
servants how they were to treat Don Quixote; and so the instant he came up
to the castle gates with the duchess, two lackeys or equerries, clad in
what they call morning gowns of fine crimson satin reaching to their feet,
hastened out, and catching Don Quixote in their arms before he saw or
heard them, said to him, “Your highness should go and take my lady
the duchess off her horse.”
</p>
<p>
<br><br><br><br> <a id="p31b"></a>

<div class="fig" style="width:60%;">

</p>
<p>
Don Quixote obeyed, and great bandying of compliments followed between the
two over the matter; but in the end the duchess’s determination
carried the day, and she refused to get down or dismount from her palfrey
except in the arms of the duke, saying she did not consider herself worthy
to impose so unnecessary a burden on so great a knight. At length the duke
came out to take her down, and as they entered a spacious court two fair
damsels came forward and threw over Don Quixote’s shoulders a large
mantle of the finest scarlet cloth, and at the same instant all the
galleries of the court were lined with the men-servants and women-servants
of the household, crying, “Welcome, flower and cream of
knight-errantry!” while all or most of them flung pellets filled
with scented water over Don Quixote and the duke and duchess; at all which
Don Quixote was greatly astonished, and this was the first time that he
thoroughly felt and believed himself to be a knight-errant in reality and
not merely in fancy, now that he saw himself treated in the same way as he
had read of such knights being treated in days of yore.
</p>
<p>
Sancho, deserting Dapple, hung on to the duchess and entered the castle,
but feeling some twinges of conscience at having left the ass alone, he
approached a respectable duenna who had come out with the rest to receive
the duchess, and in a low voice he said to her, “Señora Gonzalez, or
however your grace may be called—”
</p>
<p>
“I am called Doña Rodriguez de Grijalba,” replied the duenna;
“what is your will, brother?” To which Sancho made answer,
“I should be glad if your worship would do me the favour to go out
to the castle gate, where you will find a grey ass of mine; make them, if
you please, put him in the stable, or put him there yourself, for the poor
little beast is rather easily frightened, and cannot bear being alone at
all.”
</p>
<p>
“If the master is as wise as the man,” said the duenna,
“we have got a fine bargain. Be off with you, brother, and bad luck
to you and him who brought you here; go, look after your ass, for we, the
duennas of this house, are not used to work of that sort.”
</p>
<p>
“Well then, in troth,” returned Sancho, “I have heard my
master, who is the very treasure-finder of stories, telling the story of
Lancelot when he came from Britain, say that ladies waited upon him and
duennas upon his hack; and, if it comes to my ass, I wouldn’t change
him for Señor Lancelot’s hack.”
</p>
<p>
“If you are a jester, brother,” said the duenna, “keep
your drolleries for some place where they’ll pass muster and be paid
for; for you’ll get nothing from me but a fig.”
</p>
<p>
“At any rate, it will be a very ripe one,” said Sancho,
“for you won’t lose the trick in years by a point too little.”
</p>
<p>
“Son of a bitch,” said the duenna, all aglow with anger,
“whether I’m old or not, it’s with God I have to reckon,
not with you, you garlic-stuffed scoundrel!” and she said it so
loud, that the duchess heard it, and turning round and seeing the duenna
in such a state of excitement, and her eyes flaming so, asked whom she was
wrangling with.
</p>
<p>
“With this good fellow here,” said the duenna, “who has
particularly requested me to go and put an ass of his that is at the
castle gate into the stable, holding it up to me as an example that they
did the same I don’t know where—that some ladies waited on one
Lancelot, and duennas on his hack; and what is more, to wind up with, he
called me old.”
</p>
<p>
“That,” said the duchess, “I should have considered the
greatest affront that could be offered me;” and addressing Sancho,
she said to him, “You must know, friend Sancho, that Doña Rodriguez
is very youthful, and that she wears that hood more for authority and
custom’s sake than because of her years.”
</p>
<p>
“May all the rest of mine be unlucky,” said Sancho, “if
I meant it that way; I only spoke because the affection I have for my ass
is so great, and I thought I could not commend him to a more kind-hearted
person than the lady Doña Rodriguez.”
</p>
<p>
Don Quixote, who was listening, said to him, “Is this proper
conversation for the place, Sancho?”
</p>
<p>
“Señor,” replied Sancho, “every one must mention what he
wants wherever he may be; I thought of Dapple here, and I spoke of him
