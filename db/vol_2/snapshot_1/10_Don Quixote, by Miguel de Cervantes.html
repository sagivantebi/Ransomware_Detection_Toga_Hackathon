Said Don Quixote, “Sancho, my friend, night is drawing on upon us as
we go, and more darkly than will allow us to reach El Toboso by daylight;
for there I am resolved to go before I engage in another adventure, and
there I shall obtain the blessing and generous permission of the peerless
Dulcinea, with which permission I expect and feel assured that I shall
conclude and bring to a happy termination every perilous adventure; for
nothing in life makes knights-errant more valorous than finding themselves
favoured by their ladies.”

“So I believe,” replied Sancho; “but I think it will be
difficult for your worship to speak with her or see her, at any rate where
you will be able to receive her blessing; unless, indeed, she throws it
over the wall of the yard where I saw her the time before, when I took her
the letter that told of the follies and mad things your worship was doing
in the heart of Sierra Morena.”
</p>
<p>
“Didst thou take that for a yard wall, Sancho,” said Don
Quixote, “where or at which thou sawest that never sufficiently
extolled grace and beauty? It must have been the gallery, corridor, or
portico of some rich and royal palace.”
</p>
<p>
“It might have been all that,” returned Sancho, “but to
me it looked like a wall, unless I am short of memory.”
</p>
<p>
“At all events, let us go there, Sancho,” said Don Quixote;
“for, so that I see her, it is the same to me whether it be over a
wall, or at a window, or through the chink of a door, or the grate of a
garden; for any beam of the sun of her beauty that reaches my eyes will
give light to my reason and strength to my heart, so that I shall be
unmatched and unequalled in wisdom and valour.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, to tell the truth, señor,” said Sancho, “when I
saw that sun of the lady Dulcinea del Toboso, it was not bright enough to
throw out beams at all; it must have been, that as her grace was sifting
that wheat I told you of, the thick dust she raised came before her face
like a cloud and dimmed it.”
</p>
<p>
“What! dost thou still persist, Sancho,” said Don Quixote,
“in saying, thinking, believing, and maintaining that my lady
Dulcinea was sifting wheat, that being an occupation and task entirely at
variance with what is and should be the employment of persons of
distinction, who are constituted and reserved for other avocations and
pursuits that show their rank a bowshot off? Thou hast forgotten, O
Sancho, those lines of our poet wherein he paints for us how, in their
crystal abodes, those four nymphs employed themselves who rose from their
loved Tagus and seated themselves in a verdant meadow to embroider those
tissues which the ingenious poet there describes to us, how they were
worked and woven with gold and silk and pearls; and something of this sort
must have been the employment of my lady when thou sawest her, only that
the spite which some wicked enchanter seems to have against everything of
mine changes all those things that give me pleasure, and turns them into
shapes unlike their own; and so I fear that in that history of my
achievements which they say is now in print, if haply its author was some
sage who is an enemy of mine, he will have put one thing for another,
mingling a thousand lies with one truth, and amusing himself by relating
transactions which have nothing to do with the sequence of a true history.
O envy, root of all countless evils, and cankerworm of the virtues! All
the vices, Sancho, bring some kind of pleasure with them; but envy brings
nothing but irritation, bitterness, and rage.”
</p>
<p>
“So I say too,” replied Sancho; “and I suspect in that
legend or history of us that the bachelor Samson Carrasco told us he saw,
my honour goes dragged in the dirt, knocked about, up and down, sweeping
the streets, as they say. And yet, on the faith of an honest man, I never
spoke ill of any enchanter, and I am not so well off that I am to be
envied; to be sure, I am rather sly, and I have a certain spice of the
rogue in me; but all is covered by the great cloak of my simplicity,
always natural and never acted; and if I had no other merit save that I
believe, as I always do, firmly and truly in God, and all the holy Roman
Catholic Church holds and believes, and that I am a mortal enemy of the
Jews, the historians ought to have mercy on me and treat me well in their
writings. But let them say what they like; naked was I born, naked I find
myself, I neither lose nor gain; nay, while I see myself put into a book
and passed on from hand to hand over the world, I don’t care a fig,
let them say what they like of me.”
</p>
<p>
“That, Sancho,” returned Don Quixote, “reminds me of
what happened to a famous poet of our own day, who, having written a
bitter satire against all the courtesan ladies, did not insert or name in
it a certain lady of whom it was questionable whether she was one or not.
She, seeing she was not in the list of the poet, asked him what he had
seen in her that he did not include her in the number of the others,
telling him he must add to his satire and put her in the new part, or else
look out for the consequences. The poet did as she bade him, and left her
without a shred of reputation, and she was satisfied by getting fame
though it was infamy. In keeping with this is what they relate of that
shepherd who set fire to the famous temple of Diana, by repute one of the
seven wonders of the world, and burned it with the sole object of making
his name live in after ages; and, though it was forbidden to name him, or
mention his name by word of mouth or in writing, lest the object of his
ambition should be attained, nevertheless it became known that he was
called Erostratus. And something of the same sort is what happened in the
case of the great emperor Charles V. and a gentleman in Rome. The emperor
was anxious to see that famous temple of the Rotunda, called in ancient
times the temple ‘of all the gods,’ but now-a-days, by a
better nomenclature, ‘of all the saints,’ which is the best
preserved building of all those of pagan construction in Rome, and the one
which best sustains the reputation of mighty works and magnificence of its
founders. It is in the form of a half orange, of enormous dimensions, and
well lighted, though no light penetrates it save that which is admitted by
a window, or rather round skylight, at the top; and it was from this that
the emperor examined the building. A Roman gentleman stood by his side and
explained to him the skilful construction and ingenuity of the vast fabric
and its wonderful architecture, and when they had left the skylight he
said to the emperor, ‘A thousand times, your Sacred Majesty, the
impulse came upon me to seize your Majesty in my arms and fling myself
down from yonder skylight, so as to leave behind me in the world a name
that would last for ever.’ ‘I am thankful to you for not
carrying such an evil thought into effect,’ said the emperor,
‘and I shall give you no opportunity in future of again putting your
loyalty to the test; and I therefore forbid you ever to speak to me or to
be where I am; and he followed up these words by bestowing a liberal
bounty upon him. My meaning is, Sancho, that the desire of acquiring fame
is a very powerful motive. What, thinkest thou, was it that flung Horatius
in full armour down from the bridge into the depths of the Tiber? What
burned the hand and arm of Mutius? What impelled Curtius to plunge into
the deep burning gulf that opened in the midst of Rome? What, in
opposition to all the omens that declared against him, made Julius Cæsar
cross the Rubicon? And to come to more modern examples, what scuttled the
ships, and left stranded and cut off the gallant Spaniards under the
command of the most courteous Cortés in the New World? All these and a
variety of other great exploits are, were and will be, the work of fame
that mortals desire as a reward and a portion of the immortality their
famous deeds deserve; though we Catholic Christians and knights-errant
look more to that future glory that is everlasting in the ethereal regions
of heaven than to the vanity of the fame that is to be acquired in this
present transitory life; a fame that, however long it may last, must after
all end with the world itself, which has its own appointed end. So that, O
Sancho, in what we do we must not overpass the bounds which the Christian
religion we profess has assigned to us. We have to slay pride in giants,
envy by generosity and nobleness of heart, anger by calmness of demeanour
and equanimity, gluttony and sloth by the spareness of our diet and the
length of our vigils, lust and lewdness by the loyalty we preserve to
those whom we have made the mistresses of our thoughts, indolence by
traversing the world in all directions seeking opportunities of making
ourselves, besides Christians, famous knights. Such, Sancho, are the means
by which we reach those extremes of praise that fair fame carries with it.”
</p>
<p>
“All that your worship has said so far,” said Sancho, “I
have understood quite well; but still I would be glad if your worship
would dissolve a doubt for me, which has just this minute come into my
mind.”
</p>
<p>
“Solve, thou meanest, Sancho,” said Don Quixote; “say
on, in God’s name, and I will answer as well as I can.”
</p>
<p>
“Tell me, señor,” Sancho went on to say, “those Julys or
Augusts, and all those venturous knights that you say are now dead—where
are they now?”
</p>
<p>
“The heathens,” replied Don Quixote, “are, no doubt, in
hell; the Christians, if they were good Christians, are either in
purgatory or in heaven.”
</p>
<p>
“Very good,” said Sancho; “but now I want to know—the
tombs where the bodies of those great lords are, have they silver lamps
before them, or are the walls of their chapels ornamented with crutches,
winding-sheets, tresses of hair, legs and eyes in wax? Or what are they
ornamented with?”
</p>
<p>
To which Don Quixote made answer: “The tombs of the heathens were
generally sumptuous temples; the ashes of Julius Cæsar’s body were placed
on the top of a stone pyramid of vast size, which they now call in Rome Saint
Peter’s needle. The emperor Hadrian had for a tomb a castle as large as a
good-sized village, which they called the <i>Moles Adriani</i>, and is now the
castle of St. Angelo in Rome. The queen Artemisia buried her husband Mausolus
in a tomb which was reckoned one of the seven wonders of the world; but none of
these tombs, or of the many others of the heathens, were ornamented with
winding-sheets or any of those other offerings and tokens that show that they
who are buried there are saints.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s the point I’m coming to,” said Sancho;
“and now tell me, which is the greater work, to bring a dead man to
life or to kill a giant?”
</p>
<p>
“The answer is easy,” replied Don Quixote; “it is a
greater work to bring to life a dead man.”
</p>
<p>
“Now I have got you,” said Sancho; “in that case the
fame of them who bring the dead to life, who give sight to the blind, cure
cripples, restore health to the sick, and before whose tombs there are
lamps burning, and whose chapels are filled with devout folk on their
knees adoring their relics be a better fame in this life and in the other
than that which all the heathen emperors and knights-errant that have ever
been in the world have left or may leave behind them?”
</p>
<p>
“That I grant, too,” said Don Quixote.
</p>
<p>
“Then this fame, these favours, these privileges, or whatever you
call it,” said Sancho, “belong to the bodies and relics of the
saints who, with the approbation and permission of our holy mother Church,
have lamps, tapers, winding-sheets, crutches, pictures, eyes and legs, by
means of which they increase devotion and add to their own Christian
reputation. Kings carry the bodies or relics of saints on their shoulders,
and kiss bits of their bones, and enrich and adorn their oratories and
favourite altars with them.”
</p>
<p>
“What wouldst thou have me infer from all thou hast said, Sancho?”
asked Don Quixote.
</p>
<p>
“My meaning is,” said Sancho, “let us set about becoming
saints, and we shall obtain more quickly the fair fame we are striving
after; for you know, señor, yesterday or the day before yesterday (for it
is so lately one may say so) they canonised and beatified two little
barefoot friars, and it is now reckoned the greatest good luck to kiss or
touch the iron chains with which they girt and tortured their bodies, and
they are held in greater veneration, so it is said, than the sword of
Roland in the armoury of our lord the King, whom God preserve. So that,
señor, it is better to be an humble little friar of no matter what order,
than a valiant knight-errant; with God a couple of dozen of penance
lashings are of more avail than two thousand lance-thrusts, be they given
to giants, or monsters, or dragons.”
</p>
<p>
“All that is true,” returned Don Quixote, “but we cannot
all be friars, and many are the ways by which God takes his own to heaven;
chivalry is a religion, there are sainted knights in glory.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” said Sancho, “but I have heard say that there are
more friars in heaven than knights-errant.”
</p>
<p>
“That,” said Don Quixote, “is because those in religious
orders are more numerous than knights.”
</p>
<p>
“The errants are many,” said Sancho.
</p>
<p>
“Many,” replied Don Quixote, “but few they who deserve
the name of knights.”
</p>
<p>
With these, and other discussions of the same sort, they passed that night
and the following day, without anything worth mention happening to them,
whereat Don Quixote was not a little dejected; but at length the next day,
at daybreak, they descried the great city of El Toboso, at the sight of
which Don Quixote’s spirits rose and Sancho’s fell, for he did
not know Dulcinea’s house, nor in all his life had he ever seen her,
any more than his master; so that they were both uneasy, the one to see
her, the other at not having seen her, and Sancho was at a loss to know
what he was to do when his master sent him to El Toboso. In the end, Don
Quixote made up his mind to enter the city at nightfall, and they waited
until the time came among some oak trees that were near El Toboso; and
when the moment they had agreed upon arrived, they made their entrance
into the city, where something happened them that may fairly be called
something.

<p>
’Twas at the very midnight hour—more or less—when Don
Quixote and Sancho quitted the wood and entered El Toboso. The town was in
deep silence, for all the inhabitants were asleep, and stretched on the
broad of their backs, as the saying is. The night was darkish, though
Sancho would have been glad had it been quite dark, so as to find in the
darkness an excuse for his blundering. All over the place nothing was to
be heard except the barking of dogs, which deafened the ears of Don
Quixote and troubled the heart of Sancho. Now and then an ass brayed, pigs
grunted, cats mewed, and the various noises they made seemed louder in the
silence of the night; all which the enamoured knight took to be of evil
omen; nevertheless he said to Sancho, “Sancho, my son, lead on to
the palace of Dulcinea, it may be that we shall find her awake.”
</p>
<p>
“Body of the sun! what palace am I to lead to,” said Sancho,
“when what I saw her highness in was only a very little house?”
</p>
<p>
“Most likely she had then withdrawn into some small apartment of her
palace,” said Don Quixote, “to amuse herself with damsels, as
great ladies and princesses are accustomed to do.”
</p>
<p>
“Señor,” said Sancho, “if your worship will have it in
spite of me that the house of my lady Dulcinea is a palace, is this an
hour, think you, to find the door open; and will it be right for us to go
knocking till they hear us and open the door; making a disturbance and
confusion all through the household? Are we going, do you fancy, to the
house of our wenches, like gallants who come and knock and go in at any
hour, however late it may be?”
</p>
<p>
“Let us first of all find out the palace for certain,” replied
Don Quixote, “and then I will tell thee, Sancho, what we had best
do; but look, Sancho, for either I see badly, or that dark mass that one
sees from here should be Dulcinea’s palace.”
</p>
<p>
“Then let your worship lead the way,” said Sancho, “perhaps
it may be so; though I see it with my eyes and touch it with my hands, I’ll
believe it as much as I believe it is daylight now.”
</p>
<p>
Don Quixote took the lead, and having gone a matter of two hundred paces
he came upon the mass that produced the shade, and found it was a great
tower, and then he perceived that the building in question was no palace,
but the chief church of the town, and said he, “It’s the
church we have lit upon, Sancho.”
</p>
<p>
“So I see,” said Sancho, “and God grant we may not light
upon our graves; it is no good sign to find oneself wandering in a
graveyard at this time of night; and that, after my telling your worship,
if I don’t mistake, that the house of this lady will be in an alley
without an outlet.”
</p>
<p>
“The curse of God on thee for a blockhead!” said Don Quixote;
“where hast thou ever heard of castles and royal palaces being built
in alleys without an outlet?”
</p>
<p>
“Señor,” replied Sancho, “every country has a way of its
own; perhaps here in El Toboso it is the way to build palaces and grand
buildings in alleys; so I entreat your worship to let me search about
among these streets or alleys before me, and perhaps, in some corner or
other, I may stumble on this palace—and I wish I saw the dogs eating
it for leading us such a dance.”
</p>
<p>
“Speak respectfully of what belongs to my lady, Sancho,” said
Don Quixote; “let us keep the feast in peace, and not throw the rope
after the bucket.”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll hold my tongue,” said Sancho, “but how am I
to take it patiently when your worship wants me, with only once seeing the
house of our mistress, to know always, and find it in the middle of the
night, when your worship can’t find it, who must have seen it
thousands of times?”
</p>
<p>
“Thou wilt drive me to desperation, Sancho,” said Don Quixote.
“Look here, heretic, have I not told thee a thousand times that I
have never once in my life seen the peerless Dulcinea or crossed the
threshold of her palace, and that I am enamoured solely by hearsay and by
the great reputation she bears for beauty and discretion?”
</p>
<p>
“I hear it now,” returned Sancho; “and I may tell you
that if you have not seen her, no more have I.”
</p>
<p>
“That cannot be,” said Don Quixote, “for, at any rate,
thou saidst, on bringing back the answer to the letter I sent by thee,
that thou sawest her sifting wheat.”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t mind that, señor,” said Sancho; “I must
tell you that my seeing her and the answer I brought you back were by
hearsay too, for I can no more tell who the lady Dulcinea is than I can
hit the sky.”
</p>
<p>
“Sancho, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “there are times for
jests and times when jests are out of place; if I tell thee that I have
neither seen nor spoken to the lady of my heart, it is no reason why thou
shouldst say thou hast not spoken to her or seen her, when the contrary is
the case, as thou well knowest.”
</p>
<p>
While the two were engaged in this conversation, they perceived someone
with a pair of mules approaching the spot where they stood, and from the
noise the plough made, as it dragged along the ground, they guessed him to
be some labourer who had got up before daybreak to go to his work, and so
it proved to be. He came along singing the ballad that says-
</p>
<p class="poem">
Ill did ye fare, ye men of France,<br>
In Roncesvalles chase—
</p>
<p>
“May I die, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, when he heard him,
“if any good will come to us to-night! Dost thou not hear what that
clown is singing?”
</p>
<p>
“I do,” said Sancho, “but what has Roncesvalles chase to
do with what we have in hand? He might just as well be singing the ballad
of Calainos, for any good or ill that can come to us in our business.”
</p>
<p>
By this time the labourer had come up, and Don Quixote asked him, “Can
you tell me, worthy friend, and God speed you, whereabouts here is the
palace of the peerless princess Doña Dulcinea del Toboso?”
</p>
<p>
“Señor,” replied the lad, “I am a stranger, and I have
been only a few days in the town, doing farm work for a rich farmer. In
that house opposite there live the curate of the village and the
sacristan, and both or either of them will be able to give your worship
some account of this lady princess, for they have a list of all the people
of El Toboso; though it is my belief there is not a princess living in the
whole of it; many ladies there are, of quality, and in her own house each
of them may be a princess.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, then, she I am inquiring for will be one of these, my friend,”
said Don Quixote.
</p>
<p>
“May be so,” replied the lad; “God be with you, for here
comes the daylight;” and without waiting for any more of his
questions, he whipped on his mules.
</p>
<p>
Sancho, seeing his master downcast and somewhat dissatisfied, said to him,
“Señor, daylight will be here before long, and it will not do for us
to let the sun find us in the street; it will be better for us to quit the
city, and for your worship to hide in some forest in the neighbourhood,
and I will come back in the daytime, and I won’t leave a nook or
corner of the whole village that I won’t search for the house,
castle, or palace, of my lady, and it will be hard luck for me if I don’t
find it; and as soon as I have found it I will speak to her grace, and
tell her where and how your worship is waiting for her to arrange some
plan for you to see her without any damage to her honour and reputation.”
</p>
<p>
“Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “thou hast delivered a
thousand sentences condensed in the compass of a few words; I thank thee
for the advice thou hast given me, and take it most gladly. Come, my son,
let us go look for some place where I may hide, while thou dost return, as
thou sayest, to seek, and speak with my lady, from whose discretion and
courtesy I look for favours more than miraculous.”
</p>
<p>
Sancho was in a fever to get his master out of the town, lest he should
discover the falsehood of the reply he had brought to him in the Sierra
Morena on behalf of Dulcinea; so he hastened their departure, which they
took at once, and two miles out of the village they found a forest or
thicket wherein Don Quixote ensconced himself, while Sancho returned to
the city to speak to Dulcinea, in which embassy things befell him which
demand fresh attention and a new chapter.

When the author of this great history comes to relate what is set down in
this chapter he says he would have preferred to pass it over in silence,
fearing it would not be believed, because here Don Quixote’s madness
reaches the confines of the greatest that can be conceived, and even goes
a couple of bowshots beyond the greatest. But after all, though still
under the same fear and apprehension, he has recorded it without adding to
the story or leaving out a particle of the truth, and entirely
disregarding the charges of falsehood that might be brought against him;
and he was right, for the truth may run fine but will not break, and
always rises above falsehood as oil above water; and so, going on with his
story, he says that as soon as Don Quixote had ensconced himself in the
forest, oak grove, or wood near El Toboso, he bade Sancho return to the
city, and not come into his presence again without having first spoken on
his behalf to his lady, and begged of her that it might be her good
pleasure to permit herself to be seen by her enslaved knight, and deign to
bestow her blessing upon him, so that he might thereby hope for a happy
issue in all his encounters and difficult enterprises. Sancho undertook to
execute the task according to the instructions, and to bring back an
answer as good as the one he brought back before.
</p>
<p>
“Go, my son,” said Don Quixote, “and be not dazed when
thou findest thyself exposed to the light of that sun of beauty thou art
going to seek. Happy thou, above all the squires in the world! Bear in
mind, and let it not escape thy memory, how she receives thee; if she
changes colour while thou art giving her my message; if she is agitated
and disturbed at hearing my name; if she cannot rest upon her cushion,
shouldst thou haply find her seated in the sumptuous state chamber proper
to her rank; and should she be standing, observe if she poises herself now
on one foot, now on the other; if she repeats two or three times the reply
she gives thee; if she passes from gentleness to austerity, from asperity
to tenderness; if she raises her hand to smooth her hair though it be not
disarranged. In short, my son, observe all her actions and motions, for if
thou wilt report them to me as they were, I will gather what she hides in
the recesses of her heart as regards my love; for I would have thee know,
Sancho, if thou knowest it not, that with lovers the outward actions and
motions they give way to when their loves are in question are the faithful
messengers that carry the news of what is going on in the depths of their
hearts. Go, my friend, may better fortune than mine attend thee, and bring
thee a happier issue than that which I await in dread in this dreary
solitude.”
</p>
<p>
“I will go and return quickly,” said Sancho; “cheer up
that little heart of yours, master mine, for at the present moment you
seem to have got one no bigger than a hazel nut; remember what they say,
that a stout heart breaks bad luck, and that where there are no fletches
there are no pegs; and moreover they say, the hare jumps up where it’s
not looked for. I say this because, if we could not find my lady’s
palaces or castles to-night, now that it is daylight I count upon finding
them when I least expect it, and once found, leave it to me to manage her.”
</p>
<p>
“Verily, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “thou dost always
bring in thy proverbs happily, whatever we deal with; may God give me
better luck in what I am anxious about.”
</p>
<p>
With this, Sancho wheeled about and gave Dapple the stick, and Don Quixote
remained behind, seated on his horse, resting in his stirrups and leaning
on the end of his lance, filled with sad and troubled forebodings; and
there we will leave him, and accompany Sancho, who went off no less
serious and troubled than he left his master; so much so, that as soon as
he had got out of the thicket, and looking round saw that Don Quixote was
not within sight, he dismounted from his ass, and seating himself at the
foot of a tree began to commune with himself, saying, “Now, brother
Sancho, let us know where your worship is going. Are you going to look for
some ass that has been lost? Not at all. Then what are you going to look
for? I am going to look for a princess, that’s all; and in her for
the sun of beauty and the whole heaven at once. And where do you expect to
find all this, Sancho? Where? Why, in the great city of El Toboso. Well,
and for whom are you going to look for her? For the famous knight Don
Quixote of La Mancha, who rights wrongs, gives food to those who thirst
and drink to the hungry. That’s all very well, but do you know her
house, Sancho? My master says it will be some royal palace or grand
castle. And have you ever seen her by any chance? Neither I nor my master
ever saw her. And does it strike you that it would be just and right if
the El Toboso people, finding out that you were here with the intention of
going to tamper with their princesses and trouble their ladies, were to
come and cudgel your ribs, and not leave a whole bone in you? They would,
indeed, have very good reason, if they did not see that I am under orders,
and that ‘you are a messenger, my friend, no blame belongs to you.’
Don’t you trust to that, Sancho, for the Manchegan folk are as
hot-tempered as they are honest, and won’t put up with liberties
from anybody. By the Lord, if they get scent of you, it will be worse for
you, I promise you. Be off, you scoundrel! Let the bolt fall. Why should I
go looking for three feet on a cat, to please another man; and what is
more, when looking for Dulcinea will be looking for Marica in Ravena, or
the bachelor in Salamanca? The devil, the devil and nobody else, has mixed
me up in this business!”
</p>
<p>
Such was the soliloquy Sancho held with himself, and all the conclusion he
could come to was to say to himself again, “Well, there’s
remedy for everything except death, under whose yoke we have all to pass,
whether we like it or not, when life’s finished. I have seen by a
thousand signs that this master of mine is a madman fit to be tied, and
for that matter, I too, am not behind him; for I’m a greater fool
than he is when I follow him and serve him, if there’s any truth in
the proverb that says, ‘Tell me what company thou keepest, and I’ll
tell thee what thou art,’ or in that other, ‘Not with whom
thou art bred, but with whom thou art fed.’ Well then, if he be mad,
as he is, and with a madness that mostly takes one thing for another, and
white for black, and black for white, as was seen when he said the
windmills were giants, and the monks’ mules dromedaries, flocks of
sheep armies of enemies, and much more to the same tune, it will not be
very hard to make him believe that some country girl, the first I come
across here, is the lady Dulcinea; and if he does not believe it, I’ll
swear it; and if he should swear, I’ll swear again; and if he
persists I’ll persist still more, so as, come what may, to have my
quoit always over the peg. Maybe, by holding out in this way, I may put a
stop to his sending me on messages of this kind another time; or maybe he
will think, as I suspect he will, that one of those wicked enchanters, who
he says have a spite against him, has changed her form for the sake of
doing him an ill turn and injuring him.”
</p>
<p>
With this reflection Sancho made his mind easy, counting the business as
good as settled, and stayed there till the afternoon so as to make Don
Quixote think he had time enough to go to El Toboso and return; and things
turned out so luckily for him that as he got up to mount Dapple, he spied,
coming from El Toboso towards the spot where he stood, three peasant girls
on three colts, or fillies—for the author does not make the point
clear, though it is more likely they were she-asses, the usual mount with
village girls; but as it is of no great consequence, we need not stop to
prove it.
</p>
<p>
To be brief, the instant Sancho saw the peasant girls, he returned full
speed to seek his master, and found him sighing and uttering a thousand
passionate lamentations. When Don Quixote saw him he exclaimed, “What
news, Sancho, my friend? Am I to mark this day with a white stone or a
black?”
</p>
<p>
“Your worship,” replied Sancho, “had better mark it with
ruddle, like the inscriptions on the walls of class rooms, that those who
see it may see it plain.”
</p>
<p>
“Then thou bringest good news,” said Don Quixote.
</p>
<p>
“So good,” replied Sancho, “that your worship has only
to spur Rocinante and get out into the open field to see the lady Dulcinea
del Toboso, who, with two others, damsels of hers, is coming to see your
worship.”
</p>
<p>
“Holy God! what art thou saying, Sancho, my friend?” exclaimed
Don Quixote. “Take care thou art not deceiving me, or seeking by
false joy to cheer my real sadness.”
</p>
<p>
“What could I get by deceiving your worship,” returned Sancho,
“especially when it will so soon be shown whether I tell the truth
or not? Come, señor, push on, and you will see the princess our mistress
coming, robed and adorned—in fact, like what she is. Her damsels and
she are all one glow of gold, all bunches of pearls, all diamonds, all
rubies, all cloth of brocade of more than ten borders; with their hair
loose on their shoulders like so many sunbeams playing with the wind; and
moreover, they come mounted on three piebald cackneys, the finest sight
ever you saw.”
</p>
<p>
“Hackneys, you mean, Sancho,” said Don Quixote.
</p>
<p>
“There is not much difference between cackneys and hackneys,”
said Sancho; “but no matter what they come on, there they are, the
finest ladies one could wish for, especially my lady the princess
Dulcinea, who staggers one’s senses.”
</p>
<p>
“Let us go, Sancho, my son,” said Don Quixote, “and in
guerdon of this news, as unexpected as it is good, I bestow upon thee the
best spoil I shall win in the first adventure I may have; or if that does
not satisfy thee, I promise thee the foals I shall have this year from my
three mares that thou knowest are in foal on our village common.”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll take the foals,” said Sancho; “for it is not
quite certain that the spoils of the first adventure will be good ones.”
</p>
<p>
By this time they had cleared the wood, and saw the three village lasses
close at hand. Don Quixote looked all along the road to El Toboso, and as
he could see nobody except the three peasant girls, he was completely
puzzled, and asked Sancho if it was outside the city he had left them.
</p>
<p>
“How outside the city?” returned Sancho. “Are your
worship’s eyes in the back of your head, that you can’t see
that they are these who are coming here, shining like the very sun at
noonday?”
</p>
<p>
“I see nothing, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “but three
country girls on three jackasses.”
</p>
<p>
“Now, may God deliver me from the devil!” said Sancho, “and
can it be that your worship takes three hackneys—or whatever they’re
called—as white as the driven snow, for jackasses? By the Lord, I
could tear my beard if that was the case!”
</p>
<p>
“Well, I can only say, Sancho, my friend,” said Don Quixote,
“that it is as plain they are jackasses—or jennyasses—as
that I am Don Quixote, and thou Sancho Panza: at any rate, they seem to me
to be so.”
</p>
<p>
“Hush, señor,” said Sancho, “don’t talk that way,
but open your eyes, and come and pay your respects to the lady of your
thoughts, who is close upon us now;” and with these words he
advanced to receive the three village lasses, and dismounting from Dapple,
caught hold of one of the asses of the three country girls by the halter,
and dropping on both knees on the ground, he said, “Queen and
princess and duchess of beauty, may it please your haughtiness and
greatness to receive into your favour and good-will your captive knight
who stands there turned into marble stone, and quite stupefied and
benumbed at finding himself in your magnificent presence. I am Sancho
Panza, his squire, and he the vagabond knight Don Quixote of La Mancha,
otherwise called ‘The Knight of the Rueful Countenance.’”
</p>
<p>
Don Quixote had by this time placed himself on his knees beside Sancho,
and, with eyes starting out of his head and a puzzled gaze, was regarding
her whom Sancho called queen and lady; and as he could see nothing in her
except a village lass, and not a very well-favoured one, for she was
platter-faced and snub-nosed, he was perplexed and bewildered, and did not
venture to open his lips. The country girls, at the same time, were
astonished to see these two men, so different in appearance, on their
knees, preventing their companion from going on. She, however, who had
been stopped, breaking silence, said angrily and testily, “Get out
of the way, bad luck to you, and let us pass, for we are in a hurry.”

</p>
<p>
To which Sancho returned, “Oh, princess and universal lady of El
Toboso, is not your magnanimous heart softened by seeing the pillar and
prop of knight-errantry on his knees before your sublimated presence?”
</p>
<p>
On hearing this, one of the others exclaimed, “Woa then! why, I’m
rubbing thee down, she-ass of my father-in-law! See how the lordlings come
to make game of the village girls now, as if we here could not chaff as
well as themselves. Go your own way, and let us go ours, and it will be
better for you.”
</p>
<p>
“Get up, Sancho,” said Don Quixote at this; “I see that
fortune, ‘with evil done to me unsated still,’ has taken
possession of all the roads by which any comfort may reach ‘this
wretched soul’ that I carry in my flesh. And thou, highest
perfection of excellence that can be desired, utmost limit of grace in
human shape, sole relief of this afflicted heart that adores thee, though
the malign enchanter that persecutes me has brought clouds and cataracts
on my eyes, and to them, and them only, transformed thy unparagoned beauty
and changed thy features into those of a poor peasant girl, if so be he
has not at the same time changed mine into those of some monster to render
them loathsome in thy sight, refuse not to look upon me with tenderness
and love; seeing in this submission that I make on my knees to thy
transformed beauty the humility with which my soul adores thee.”
</p>
<p>
“Hey-day! My grandfather!” cried the girl, “much I care
for your love-making! Get out of the way and let us pass, and we’ll
thank you.”
</p>
<p>
Sancho stood aside and let her go, very well pleased to have got so well
out of the hobble he was in. The instant the village lass who had done
duty for Dulcinea found herself free, prodding her “cackney”
with a spike she had at the end of a stick, she set off at full speed
across the field. The she-ass, however, feeling the point more acutely
than usual, began cutting such capers, that it flung the lady Dulcinea to
the ground; seeing which, Don Quixote ran to raise her up, and Sancho to
fix and girth the pack-saddle, which also had slipped under the ass’s
belly. The pack-saddle being secured, as Don Quixote was about to lift up
his enchanted mistress in his arms and put her upon her beast, the lady,
getting up from the ground, saved him the trouble, for, going back a
little, she took a short run, and putting both hands on the croup of the
ass she dropped into the saddle more lightly than a falcon, and sat
astride like a man, whereat Sancho said, “Rogue! but our lady is
lighter than a lanner, and might teach the cleverest Cordovan or Mexican
how to mount; she cleared the back of the saddle in one jump, and without
spurs she is making the hackney go like a zebra; and her damsels are no
way behind her, for they all fly like the wind;” which was the
truth, for as soon as they saw Dulcinea mounted, they pushed on after her,
and sped away without looking back, for more than half a league.
</p>
<p>
Don Quixote followed them with his eyes, and when they were no longer in
sight, he turned to Sancho and said, “How now, Sancho? thou seest
how I am hated by enchanters! And see to what a length the malice and
spite they bear me go, when they seek to deprive me of the happiness it
would give me to see my lady in her own proper form. The fact is I was
born to be an example of misfortune, and the target and mark at which the
arrows of adversity are aimed and directed. Observe too, Sancho, that
these traitors were not content with changing and transforming my
Dulcinea, but they transformed and changed her into a shape as mean and
ill-favoured as that of the village girl yonder; and at the same time they
robbed her of that which is such a peculiar property of ladies of
distinction, that is to say, the sweet fragrance that comes of being
always among perfumes and flowers. For I must tell thee, Sancho, that when
I approached to put Dulcinea upon her hackney (as thou sayest it was,
though to me it appeared a she-ass), she gave me a whiff of raw garlic
that made my head reel, and poisoned my very heart.”
</p>
<p>
“O scum of the earth!” cried Sancho at this, “O
miserable, spiteful enchanters! O that I could see you all strung by the
gills, like sardines on a twig! Ye know a great deal, ye can do a great
deal, and ye do a great deal more. It ought to have been enough for you,
ye scoundrels, to have changed the pearls of my lady’s eyes into oak
galls, and her hair of purest gold into the bristles of a red ox’s
tail, and in short, all her features from fair to foul, without meddling
with her smell; for by that we might somehow have found out what was
hidden underneath that ugly rind; though, to tell the truth, I never
perceived her ugliness, but only her beauty, which was raised to the
highest pitch of perfection by a mole she had on her right lip, like a
moustache, with seven or eight red hairs like threads of gold, and more
than a palm long.”
</p>
<p>
“From the correspondence which exists between those of the face and
those of the body,” said Don Quixote, “Dulcinea must have
another mole resembling that on the thick of the thigh on that side on
which she has the one on her face; but hairs of the length thou hast
mentioned are very long for moles.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, all I can say is there they were as plain as could be,”
replied Sancho.
</p>
<p>
“I believe it, my friend,” returned Don Quixote; “for
nature bestowed nothing on Dulcinea that was not perfect and
well-finished; and so, if she had a hundred moles like the one thou hast
described, in her they would not be moles, but moons and shining stars.
But tell me, Sancho, that which seemed to me to be a pack-saddle as thou
wert fixing it, was it a flat-saddle or a side-saddle?”
</p>
<p>
“It was neither,” replied Sancho, “but a jineta saddle,
with a field covering worth half a kingdom, so rich is it.”
</p>
<p>
“And that I could not see all this, Sancho!” said Don Quixote;
“once more I say, and will say a thousand times, I am the most
unfortunate of men.”
</p>
<p>
Sancho, the rogue, had enough to do to hide his laughter, at hearing the
simplicity of the master he had so nicely befooled. At length, after a
good deal more conversation had passed between them, they remounted their
beasts, and followed the road to Saragossa, which they expected to reach
in time to take part in a certain grand festival which is held every year
in that illustrious city; but before they got there things happened to
them, so many, so important, and so strange, that they deserve to be
recorded and read, as will be seen farther on.

</p>
<p>
Dejected beyond measure did Don Quixote pursue his journey, turning over
in his mind the cruel trick the enchanters had played him in changing his
lady Dulcinea into the vile shape of the village lass, nor could he think
of any way of restoring her to her original form; and these reflections so
absorbed him, that without being aware of it he let go Rocinante’s
bridle, and he, perceiving the liberty that was granted him, stopped at
every step to crop the fresh grass with which the plain abounded.
</p>
<p>
Sancho recalled him from his reverie. “Melancholy, señor,”
said he, “was made, not for beasts, but for men; but if men give way
to it overmuch they turn to beasts; control yourself, your worship; be
yourself again; gather up Rocinante’s reins; cheer up, rouse
yourself and show that gallant spirit that knights-errant ought to have.
What the devil is this? What weakness is this? Are we here or in France?
The devil fly away with all the Dulcineas in the world; for the well-being
of a single knight-errant is of more consequence than all the enchantments
and transformations on earth.”
</p>
<p>
“Hush, Sancho,” said Don Quixote in a weak and faint voice,
“hush and utter no blasphemies against that enchanted lady; for I
alone am to blame for her misfortune and hard fate; her calamity has come
of the hatred the wicked bear me.”
</p>
<p>
“So say I,” returned Sancho; “his heart rend in twain, I
trow, who saw her once, to see her now.”
</p>
<p>
“Thou mayest well say that, Sancho,” replied Don Quixote,
“as thou sawest her in the full perfection of her beauty; for the
enchantment does not go so far as to pervert thy vision or hide her
loveliness from thee; against me alone and against my eyes is the strength
of its venom directed. Nevertheless, there is one thing which has occurred
to me, and that is that thou didst ill describe her beauty to me, for, as
well as I recollect, thou saidst that her eyes were pearls; but eyes that
are like pearls are rather the eyes of a sea-bream than of a lady, and I
am persuaded that Dulcinea’s must be green emeralds, full and soft,
with two rainbows for eyebrows; take away those pearls from her eyes and
transfer them to her teeth; for beyond a doubt, Sancho, thou hast taken
the one for the other, the eyes for the teeth.”
</p>
<p>
“Very likely,” said Sancho; “for her beauty bewildered
me as much as her ugliness did your worship; but let us leave it all to
God, who alone knows what is to happen in this vale of tears, in this evil
world of ours, where there is hardly a thing to be found without some
mixture of wickedness, roguery, and rascality. But one thing, señor,
troubles me more than all the rest, and that is thinking what is to be
done when your worship conquers some giant, or some other knight, and
orders him to go and present himself before the beauty of the lady
Dulcinea. Where is this poor giant, or this poor wretch of a vanquished
knight, to find her? I think I can see them wandering all over El Toboso,
looking like noddies, and asking for my lady Dulcinea; and even if they
meet her in the middle of the street they won’t know her any more
than they would my father.”
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps, Sancho,” returned Don Quixote, “the
enchantment does not go so far as to deprive conquered and presented
giants and knights of the power of recognising Dulcinea; we will try by
experiment with one or two of the first I vanquish and send to her,
whether they see her or not, by commanding them to return and give me an
account of what happened to them in this respect.”
</p>
<p>
“I declare, I think what your worship has proposed is excellent,”
said Sancho; “and that by this plan we shall find out what we want
to know; and if it be that it is only from your worship she is hidden, the
misfortune will be more yours than hers; but so long as the lady Dulcinea
is well and happy, we on our part will make the best of it, and get on as
well as we can, seeking our adventures, and leaving Time to take his own
course; for he is the best physician for these and greater ailments.”
</p>
<p>
Don Quixote was about to reply to Sancho Panza, but he was prevented by a
cart crossing the road full of the most diverse and strange personages and
figures that could be imagined. He who led the mules and acted as carter
was a hideous demon; the cart was open to the sky, without a tilt or cane
roof, and the first figure that presented itself to Don Quixote’s
eyes was that of Death itself with a human face; next to it was an angel
with large painted wings, and at one side an emperor, with a crown, to all
appearance of gold, on his head. At the feet of Death was the god called
Cupid, without his bandage, but with his bow, quiver, and arrows; there
was also a knight in full armour, except that he had no morion or helmet,
but only a hat decked with plumes of divers colours; and along with these
there were others with a variety of costumes and faces. All this,
unexpectedly encountered, took Don Quixote somewhat aback, and struck
terror into the heart of Sancho; but the next instant Don Quixote was glad
of it, believing that some new perilous adventure was presenting itself to
him, and under this impression, and with a spirit prepared to face any
danger, he planted himself in front of the cart, and in a loud and
menacing tone, exclaimed, “Carter, or coachman, or devil, or
whatever thou art, tell me at once who thou art, whither thou art going,
and who these folk are thou carriest in thy wagon, which looks more like
Charon’s boat than an ordinary cart.”
</p>
<p>
To which the devil, stopping the cart, answered quietly, “Señor, we
are players of Angulo el Malo’s company; we have been acting the
play of ‘The Cortés of Death’ this morning, which is the
octave of Corpus Christi, in a village behind that hill, and we have to
act it this afternoon in that village which you can see from this; and as
it is so near, and to save the trouble of undressing and dressing again,
we go in the costumes in which we perform. That lad there appears as
Death, that other as an angel, that woman, the manager’s wife, plays
the queen, this one the soldier, that the emperor, and I the devil; and I
am one of the principal characters of the play, for in this company I take
the leading parts. If you want to know anything more about us, ask me and
I will answer with the utmost exactitude, for as I am a devil I am up to
everything.”
</p>
<p>
“By the faith of a knight-errant,” replied Don Quixote,
“when I saw this cart I fancied some great adventure was presenting
itself to me; but I declare one must touch with the hand what appears to
the eye, if illusions are to be avoided. God speed you, good people; keep
your festival, and remember, if you demand of me ought wherein I can
render you a service, I will do it gladly and willingly, for from a child
I was fond of the play, and in my youth a keen lover of the actor’s
art.”
</p>
<p>
While they were talking, fate so willed it that one of the company in a
mummers’ dress with a great number of bells, and armed with three
blown ox-bladders at the end of a stick, joined them, and this
merry-andrew approaching Don Quixote, began flourishing his stick and
banging the ground with the bladders and cutting capers with great
jingling of the bells, which untoward apparition so startled Rocinante
that, in spite of Don Quixote’s efforts to hold him in, taking the
bit between his teeth he set off across the plain with greater speed than
the bones of his anatomy ever gave any promise of.

<p>
Sancho, who thought his master was in danger of being thrown, jumped off
Dapple, and ran in all haste to help him; but by the time he reached him
he was already on the ground, and beside him was Rocinante, who had come
down with his master, the usual end and upshot of Rocinante’s
vivacity and high spirits. But the moment Sancho quitted his beast to go
and help Don Quixote, the dancing devil with the bladders jumped up on
Dapple, and beating him with them, more by the fright and the noise than
by the pain of the blows, made him fly across the fields towards the
village where they were going to hold their festival. Sancho witnessed
Dapple’s career and his master’s fall, and did not know which
of the two cases of need he should attend to first; but in the end, like a
good squire and good servant, he let his love for his master prevail over
his affection for his ass; though every time he saw the bladders rise in
the air and come down on the hind quarters of his Dapple he felt the pains
and terrors of death, and he would have rather had the blows fall on the
apples of his own eyes than on the least hair of his ass’s tail. In
this trouble and perplexity he came to where Don Quixote lay in a far
sorrier plight than he liked, and having helped him to mount Rocinante, he
said to him, “Señor, the devil has carried off my Dapple.”
</p>
<p>
“What devil?” asked Don Quixote.
</p>
<p>
“The one with the bladders,” said Sancho.
</p>
<p>
“Then I will recover him,” said Don Quixote, “even if he
be shut up with him in the deepest and darkest dungeons of hell. Follow
me, Sancho, for the cart goes slowly, and with the mules of it I will make
good the loss of Dapple.”
</p>
<p>
“You need not take the trouble, señor,” said Sancho; “keep
cool, for as I now see, the devil has let Dapple go and he is coming back
to his old quarters;” and so it turned out, for, having come down
with Dapple, in imitation of Don Quixote and Rocinante, the devil made off
on foot to the town, and the ass came back to his master.
</p>
<p>
“For all that,” said Don Quixote, “it will be well to
visit the discourtesy of that devil upon some of those in the cart, even
if it were the emperor himself.”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t think of it, your worship,” returned Sancho;
“take my advice and never meddle with actors, for they are a
favoured class; I myself have known an actor taken up for two murders, and
yet come off scot-free; remember that, as they are merry folk who give
pleasure, everyone favours and protects them, and helps and makes much of
them, above all when they are those of the royal companies and under
patent, all or most of whom in dress and appearance look like princes.”
</p>
<p>
“Still, for all that,” said Don Quixote, “the player
devil must not go off boasting, even if the whole human race favours him.”
</p>
<p>
So saying, he made for the cart, which was now very near the town,
shouting out as he went, “Stay! halt! ye merry, jovial crew! I want
to teach you how to treat asses and animals that serve the squires of
knights-errant for steeds.”
</p>
<p>
So loud were the shouts of Don Quixote, that those in the cart heard and
understood them, and, guessing by the words what the speaker’s
intention was, Death in an instant jumped out of the cart, and the
emperor, the devil carter and the angel after him, nor did the queen or
the god Cupid stay behind; and all armed themselves with stones and formed
in line, prepared to receive Don Quixote on the points of their pebbles.
Don Quixote, when he saw them drawn up in such a gallant array with
uplifted arms ready for a mighty discharge of stones, checked Rocinante
and began to consider in what way he could attack them with the least
danger to himself. As he halted Sancho came up, and seeing him disposed to
attack this well-ordered squadron, said to him, “It would be the
height of madness to attempt such an enterprise; remember, señor, that
against sops from the brook, and plenty of them, there is no defensive
armour in the world, except to stow oneself away under a brass bell; and
besides, one should remember that it is rashness, and not valour, for a
single man to attack an army that has Death in it, and where emperors
fight in person, with angels, good and bad, to help them; and if this
reflection will not make you keep quiet, perhaps it will to know for
certain that among all these, though they look like kings, princes, and
emperors, there is not a single knight-errant.”
</p>
<p>
“Now indeed thou hast hit the point, Sancho,” said Don
Quixote, “which may and should turn me from the resolution I had
already formed. I cannot and must not draw sword, as I have many a time
before told thee, against anyone who is not a dubbed knight; it is for
thee, Sancho, if thou wilt, to take vengeance for the wrong done to thy
Dapple; and I will help thee from here by shouts and salutary counsels.”
</p>
<p>
“There is no occasion to take vengeance on anyone, señor,”
replied Sancho; “for it is not the part of good Christians to
revenge wrongs; and besides, I will arrange it with my ass to leave his
grievance to my good-will and pleasure, and that is to live in peace as
long as heaven grants me life.”
</p>
<p>
“Well,” said Don Quixote, “if that be thy determination,
good Sancho, sensible Sancho, Christian Sancho, honest Sancho, let us
leave these phantoms alone and turn to the pursuit of better and worthier
adventures; for, from what I see of this country, we cannot fail to find
plenty of marvellous ones in it.”
</p>
<p>
He at once wheeled about, Sancho ran to take possession of his Dapple,
Death and his flying squadron returned to their cart and pursued their
journey, and thus the dread adventure of the cart of Death ended happily,
thanks to the advice Sancho gave his master; who had, the following day, a
fresh adventure, of no less thrilling interest than the last, with an
enamoured knight-errant.

OF THE STRANGE ADVENTURE WHICH BEFELL THE VALIANT DON QUIXOTE WITH THE

</p>
<p>
The night succeeding the day of the encounter with Death, Don Quixote and
his squire passed under some tall shady trees, and Don Quixote at Sancho’s
persuasion ate a little from the store carried by Dapple, and over their
supper Sancho said to his master, “Señor, what a fool I should have
looked if I had chosen for my reward the spoils of the first adventure
your worship achieved, instead of the foals of the three mares. After all,
‘a sparrow in the hand is better than a vulture on the wing.’”
</p>
<p>
“At the same time, Sancho,” replied Don Quixote, “if
thou hadst let me attack them as I wanted, at the very least the emperor’s
gold crown and Cupid’s painted wings would have fallen to thee as
spoils, for I should have taken them by force and given them into thy
hands.”
</p>
<p>
“The sceptres and crowns of those play-actor emperors,” said
Sancho, “were never yet pure gold, but only brass foil or tin.”
</p>
<p>
“That is true,” said Don Quixote, “for it would not be
right that the accessories of the drama should be real, instead of being
mere fictions and semblances, like the drama itself; towards which, Sancho—and,
as a necessary consequence, towards those who represent and produce it—I
would that thou wert favourably disposed, for they are all instruments of
great good to the State, placing before us at every step a mirror in which
we may see vividly displayed what goes on in human life; nor is there any
similitude that shows us more faithfully what we are and ought to be than
the play and the players. Come, tell me, hast thou not seen a play acted
in which kings, emperors, pontiffs, knights, ladies, and divers other
personages were introduced? One plays the villain, another the knave, this
one the merchant, that the soldier, one the sharp-witted fool, another the
foolish lover; and when the play is over, and they have put off the
dresses they wore in it, all the actors become equal.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, I have seen that,” said Sancho.
</p>
<p>
“Well then,” said Don Quixote, “the same thing happens
in the comedy and life of this world, where some play emperors, others
popes, and, in short, all the characters that can be brought into a play;
but when it is over, that is to say when life ends, death strips them all
of the garments that distinguish one from the other, and all are equal in
the grave.”
</p>
<p>
“A fine comparison!” said Sancho; “though not so new but
that I have heard it many and many a time, as well as that other one of
the game of chess; how, so long as the game lasts, each piece has its own
particular office, and when the game is finished they are all mixed,
jumbled up and shaken together, and stowed away in the bag, which is much
like ending life in the grave.”
</p>
<p>
“Thou art growing less doltish and more shrewd every day, Sancho,”
said Don Quixote.
</p>
<p>
“Ay,” said Sancho; “it must be that some of your worship’s
shrewdness sticks to me; land that, of itself, is barren and dry, will
come to yield good fruit if you dung it and till it; what I mean is that
your worship’s conversation has been the dung that has fallen on the
barren soil of my dry wit, and the time I have been in your service and
society has been the tillage; and with the help of this I hope to yield
fruit in abundance that will not fall away or slide from those paths of
good breeding that your worship has made in my parched understanding.”
</p>
<p>
Don Quixote laughed at Sancho’s affected phraseology, and perceived
that what he said about his improvement was true, for now and then he
spoke in a way that surprised him; though always, or mostly, when Sancho
tried to talk fine and attempted polite language, he wound up by toppling
over from the summit of his simplicity into the abyss of his ignorance;
and where he showed his culture and his memory to the greatest advantage
was in dragging in proverbs, no matter whether they had any bearing or not
upon the subject in hand, as may have been seen already and will be
noticed in the course of this history.

</p>
<p>
In conversation of this kind they passed a good part of the night, but
Sancho felt a desire to let down the curtains of his eyes, as he used to
say when he wanted to go to sleep; and stripping Dapple he left him at
liberty to graze his fill. He did not remove Rocinante’s saddle, as
his master’s express orders were, that so long as they were in the
field or not sleeping under a roof Rocinante was not to be stripped—the
ancient usage established and observed by knights-errant being to take off
the bridle and hang it on the saddle-bow, but to remove the saddle from
the horse—never! Sancho acted accordingly, and gave him the same
liberty he had given Dapple, between whom and Rocinante there was a
friendship so unequalled and so strong, that it is handed down by
tradition from father to son, that the author of this veracious history
devoted some special chapters to it, which, in order to preserve the
propriety and decorum due to a history so heroic, he did not insert
therein; although at times he forgets this resolution of his and describes
how eagerly the two beasts would scratch one another when they were
together and how, when they were tired or full, Rocinante would lay his
neck across Dapple’s, stretching half a yard or more on the other
side, and the pair would stand thus, gazing thoughtfully on the ground,
for three days, or at least so long as they were left alone, or hunger did
not drive them to go and look for food. I may add that they say the author
left it on record that he likened their friendship to that of Nisus and
Euryalus, and Pylades and Orestes; and if that be so, it may be perceived,
to the admiration of mankind, how firm the friendship must have been
between these two peaceful animals, shaming men, who preserve friendships
with one another so badly. This was why it was said-
</p>
<p class="poem">
For friend no longer is there friend;<br>
The reeds turn lances now.
</p>
<p class="noindent">
And someone else has sung—
</p>
<p class="poem">
Friend to friend the bug, etc.
</p>
<p class="noindent">
and let no one fancy that the author was at all astray when he compared
the friendship of these animals to that of men; for men have received many
lessons from beasts, and learned many important things, as, for example,
the clyster from the stork, vomit and gratitude from the dog, watchfulness
from the crane, foresight from the ant, modesty from the elephant, and
loyalty from the horse.
</p>
<p>
Sancho at last fell asleep at the foot of a cork tree, while Don Quixote
dozed at that of a sturdy oak; but a short time only had elapsed when a
noise he heard behind him awoke him, and rising up startled, he listened
and looked in the direction the noise came from, and perceived two men on
horseback, one of whom, letting himself drop from the saddle, said to the
other, “Dismount, my friend, and take the bridles off the horses,
for, so far as I can see, this place will furnish grass for them, and the
solitude and silence my love-sick thoughts need of.” As he said this
he stretched himself upon the ground, and as he flung himself down, the
armour in which he was clad rattled, whereby Don Quixote perceived that he
must be a knight-errant; and going over to Sancho, who was asleep, he
shook him by the arm and with no small difficulty brought him back to his
senses, and said in a low voice to him, “Brother Sancho, we have got
an adventure.”
</p>
<p>
“God send us a good one,” said Sancho; “and where may
her ladyship the adventure be?”
</p>
<p>
“Where, Sancho?” replied Don Quixote; “turn thine eyes
and look, and thou wilt see stretched there a knight-errant, who, it
strikes me, is not over and above happy, for I saw him fling himself off
his horse and throw himself on the ground with a certain air of dejection,
and his armour rattled as he fell.”
</p>
<p>
“Well,” said Sancho, “how does your worship make out
that to be an adventure?”
</p>
<p>
“I do not mean to say,” returned Don Quixote, “that it
is a complete adventure, but that it is the beginning of one, for it is in
this way adventures begin. But listen, for it seems he is tuning a lute or
guitar, and from the way he is spitting and clearing his chest he must be
getting ready to sing something.”
</p>
<p>
“Faith, you are right,” said Sancho, “and no doubt he is
some enamoured knight.”
</p>
<p>
“There is no knight-errant that is not,” said Don Quixote;
“but let us listen to him, for, if he sings, by that thread we shall
extract the ball of his thoughts; because out of the abundance of the
heart the mouth speaketh.”
</p>
<p>
Sancho was about to reply to his master, but the Knight of the Grove’s
voice, which was neither very bad nor very good, stopped him, and
listening attentively the pair heard him sing this
</p>
<p class="poem">
SONNET<br>
<br>
Your pleasure, prithee, lady mine, unfold;<br>
Declare the terms that I am to obey;<br>
My will to yours submissively I mould,<br>
And from your law my feet shall never stray.<br>
Would you I die, to silent grief a prey?<br>
Then count me even now as dead and cold;<br>
Would you I tell my woes in some new way?<br>
Then shall my tale by Love itself be told.<br>
The unison of opposites to prove,<br>
Of the soft wax and diamond hard am I;<br>
But still, obedient to the laws of love,<br>
Here, hard or soft, I offer you my breast,<br>
Whate’er you grave or stamp thereon shall rest<br>
Indelible for all eternity.<br>
</p>
<p>
With an “Ah me!” that seemed to be drawn from the inmost
recesses of his heart, the Knight of the Grove brought his lay to an end,
and shortly afterwards exclaimed in a melancholy and piteous voice,
“O fairest and most ungrateful woman on earth! What! can it be, most
serene Casildea de Vandalia, that thou wilt suffer this thy captive knight
to waste away and perish in ceaseless wanderings and rude and arduous
toils? It is not enough that I have compelled all the knights of Navarre,
all the Leonese, all the Tartesians, all the Castilians, and finally all
the knights of La Mancha, to confess thee the most beautiful in the world?”
</p>
<p>
“Not so,” said Don Quixote at this, “for I am of La
Mancha, and I have never confessed anything of the sort, nor could I nor
should I confess a thing so much to the prejudice of my lady’s
beauty; thou seest how this knight is raving, Sancho. But let us listen,
perhaps he will tell us more about himself.”
</p>
<p>
“That he will,” returned Sancho, “for he seems in a mood
to bewail himself for a month at a stretch.”
</p>
<p>
But this was not the case, for the Knight of the Grove, hearing voices
near him, instead of continuing his lamentation, stood up and exclaimed in
a distinct but courteous tone, “Who goes there? What are you? Do you
belong to the number of the happy or of the miserable?”
</p>
<p>
“Of the miserable,” answered Don Quixote.
</p>
<p>
“Then come to me,” said he of the Grove, “and rest
assured that it is to woe itself and affliction itself you come.”
</p>
<p>
Don Quixote, finding himself answered in such a soft and courteous manner,
went over to him, and so did Sancho.
</p>
<p>
The doleful knight took Don Quixote by the arm, saying, “Sit down
here, sir knight; for, that you are one, and of those that profess
knight-errantry, it is to me a sufficient proof to have found you in this
place, where solitude and night, the natural couch and proper retreat of
knights-errant, keep you company.” To which Don made answer, “A
knight I am of the profession you mention, and though sorrows,
misfortunes, and calamities have made my heart their abode, the compassion
I feel for the misfortunes of others has not been thereby banished from
it. From what you have just now sung I gather that yours spring from love,
I mean from the love you bear that fair ingrate you named in your lament.”
</p>
<p>
In the meantime, they had seated themselves together on the hard ground
peaceably and sociably, just as if, as soon as day broke, they were not
going to break one another’s heads.
</p>
<p>
“Are you, sir knight, in love perchance?” asked he of the
Grove of Don Quixote.
</p>
<p>
“By mischance I am,” replied Don Quixote; “though the
ills arising from well-bestowed affections should be esteemed favours
rather than misfortunes.”
</p>
<p>
“That is true,” returned he of the Grove, “if scorn did
not unsettle our reason and understanding, for if it be excessive it looks
like revenge.”
</p>
<p>
“I was never scorned by my lady,” said Don Quixote.
</p>
<p>
“Certainly not,” said Sancho, who stood close by, “for
my lady is as a lamb, and softer than a roll of butter.”
</p>
<p>
“Is this your squire?” asked he of the Grove.
</p>
<p>
“He is,” said Don Quixote.
</p>
<p>
“I never yet saw a squire,” said he of the Grove, “who
ventured to speak when his master was speaking; at least, there is mine,
who is as big as his father, and it cannot be proved that he has ever
opened his lips when I am speaking.”
</p>
<p>
“By my faith then,” said Sancho, “I have spoken, and am
fit to speak, in the presence of one as much, or even—but never mind—it
only makes it worse to stir it.”
</p>
<p>
The squire of the Grove took Sancho by the arm, saying to him, “Let
us two go where we can talk in squire style as much as we please, and
leave these gentlemen our masters to fight it out over the story of their
loves; and, depend upon it, daybreak will find them at it without having
made an end of it.”
</p>
<p>
“So be it by all means,” said Sancho; “and I will tell
your worship who I am, that you may see whether I am to be reckoned among
the number of the most talkative squires.”
</p>
<p>
With this the two squires withdrew to one side, and between them there
passed a conversation as droll as that which passed between their masters
was serious.

</p>
<p>
The knights and the squires made two parties, these telling the story of
their lives, the others the story of their loves; but the history relates
first of all the conversation of the servants, and afterwards takes up
that of the masters; and it says that, withdrawing a little from the
others, he of the Grove said to Sancho, “A hard life it is we lead
and live, señor, we that are squires to knights-errant; verily, we eat our
bread in the sweat of our faces, which is one of the curses God laid on
our first parents.”
</p>
<p>
“It may be said, too,” added Sancho, “that we eat it in
the chill of our bodies; for who gets more heat and cold than the
miserable squires of knight-errantry? Even so it would not be so bad if we
had something to eat, for woes are lighter if there’s bread; but
sometimes we go a day or two without breaking our fast, except with the
wind that blows.”
</p>
<p>
“All that,” said he of the Grove, “may be endured and
put up with when we have hopes of reward; for, unless the knight-errant he
serves is excessively unlucky, after a few turns the squire will at least
find himself rewarded with a fine government of some island or some fair
county.”
</p>
<p>
“I,” said Sancho, “have already told my master that I
shall be content with the government of some island, and he is so noble
and generous that he has promised it to me ever so many times.”
</p>
<p>
“I,” said he of the Grove, “shall be satisfied with a
canonry for my services, and my master has already assigned me one.”
</p>
<p>
“Your master,” said Sancho, “no doubt is a knight in the
Church line, and can bestow rewards of that sort on his good squire; but
mine is only a layman; though I remember some clever, but, to my mind,
designing people, strove to persuade him to try and become an archbishop.
He, however, would not be anything but an emperor; but I was trembling all
the time lest he should take a fancy to go into the Church, not finding
myself fit to hold office in it; for I may tell you, though I seem a man,
I am no better than a beast for the Church.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, then, you are wrong there,” said he of the Grove;
“for those island governments are not all satisfactory; some are
awkward, some are poor, some are dull, and, in short, the highest and
choicest brings with it a heavy burden of cares and troubles which the
unhappy wight to whose lot it has fallen bears upon his shoulders. Far
better would it be for us who have adopted this accursed service to go
back to our own houses, and there employ ourselves in pleasanter
occupations—in hunting or fishing, for instance; for what squire in
the world is there so poor as not to have a hack and a couple of
greyhounds and a fishingrod to amuse himself with in his own village?”
</p>
<p>
“I am not in want of any of those things,” said Sancho;
“to be sure I have no hack, but I have an ass that is worth my
master’s horse twice over; God send me a bad Easter, and that the
next one I am to see, if I would swap, even if I got four bushels of
barley to boot. You will laugh at the value I put on my Dapple—for
dapple is the colour of my beast. As to greyhounds, I can’t want for
them, for there are enough and to spare in my town; and, moreover, there
is more pleasure in sport when it is at other people’s expense.”
</p>
<p>
“In truth and earnest, sir squire,” said he of the Grove,
“I have made up my mind and determined to have done with these
drunken vagaries of these knights, and go back to my village, and bring up
my children; for I have three, like three Oriental pearls.”
</p>
<p>
“I have two,” said Sancho, “that might be presented
before the Pope himself, especially a girl whom I am breeding up for a
countess, please God, though in spite of her mother.”
</p>
<p>
“And how old is this lady that is being bred up for a countess?”
asked he of the Grove.
</p>
<p>
“Fifteen, a couple of years more or less,” answered Sancho;
“but she is as tall as a lance, and as fresh as an April morning,
and as strong as a porter.”
</p>
<p>
“Those are gifts to fit her to be not only a countess but a nymph of
the greenwood,” said he of the Grove; “whoreson strumpet! what
pith the rogue must have!”
</p>
<p>
To which Sancho made answer, somewhat sulkily, “She’s no
strumpet, nor was her mother, nor will either of them be, please God,
while I live; speak more civilly; for one bred up among knights-errant,
who are courtesy itself, your words don’t seem to me to be very
becoming.”
</p>
<p>
“O how little you know about compliments, sir squire,”
returned he of the Grove. “What! don’t you know that when a
horseman delivers a good lance thrust at the bull in the plaza, or when
anyone does anything very well, the people are wont to say, ‘Ha,
whoreson rip! how well he has done it!’ and that what seems to be
abuse in the expression is high praise? Disown sons and daughters, señor,
who don’t do what deserves that compliments of this sort should be
paid to their parents.”
</p>
<p>
“I do disown them,” replied Sancho, “and in this way,
and by the same reasoning, you might call me and my children and my wife
all the strumpets in the world, for all they do and say is of a kind that
in the highest degree deserves the same praise; and to see them again I
pray God to deliver me from mortal sin, or, what comes to the same thing,
to deliver me from this perilous calling of squire into which I have
fallen a second time, decayed and beguiled by a purse with a hundred
ducats that I found one day in the heart of the Sierra Morena; and the
devil is always putting a bag full of doubloons before my eyes, here,
there, everywhere, until I fancy at every stop I am putting my hand on it,
and hugging it, and carrying it home with me, and making investments, and
getting interest, and living like a prince; and so long as I think of this
I make light of all the hardships I endure with this simpleton of a master
of mine, who, I well know, is more of a madman than a knight.”
</p>
<p>
“There’s why they say that ‘covetousness bursts the bag,’”
said he of the Grove; “but if you come to talk of that sort, there
is not a greater one in the world than my master, for he is one of those
of whom they say, ‘the cares of others kill the ass;’ for, in
order that another knight may recover the senses he has lost, he makes a
madman of himself and goes looking for what, when found, may, for all I
know, fly in his own face.” “And is he in love perchance?”
asked Sancho.
</p>
<p>
“He is,” said of the Grove, “with one Casildea de
Vandalia, the rawest and best roasted lady the whole world could produce;
but that rawness is not the only foot he limps on, for he has greater
schemes rumbling in his bowels, as will be seen before many hours are
over.”
</p>
<p>
“There’s no road so smooth but it has some hole or hindrance
in it,” said Sancho; “in other houses they cook beans, but in
mine it’s by the potful; madness will have more followers and
hangers-on than sound sense; but if there be any truth in the common
saying, that to have companions in trouble gives some relief, I may take
consolation from you, inasmuch as you serve a master as crazy as my own.”
</p>
<p>
“Crazy but valiant,” replied he of the Grove, “and more
roguish than crazy or valiant.”
</p>
<p>
“Mine is not that,” said Sancho; “I mean he has nothing
of the rogue in him; on the contrary, he has the soul of a pitcher; he has
no thought of doing harm to anyone, only good to all, nor has he any
malice whatever in him; a child might persuade him that it is night at
noonday; and for this simplicity I love him as the core of my heart, and I
can’t bring myself to leave him, let him do ever such foolish
things.”
</p>
<p>
“For all that, brother and señor,” said he of the Grove,
“if the blind lead the blind, both are in danger of falling into the
pit. It is better for us to beat a quiet retreat and get back to our own
quarters; for those who seek adventures don’t always find good ones.”
</p>
<p>
Sancho kept spitting from time to time, and his spittle seemed somewhat
ropy and dry, observing which the compassionate squire of the Grove said,
“It seems to me that with all this talk of ours our tongues are
sticking to the roofs of our mouths; but I have a pretty good loosener
hanging from the saddle-bow of my horse,” and getting up he came
back the next minute with a large bota of wine and a pasty half a yard
across; and this is no exaggeration, for it was made of a house rabbit so
big that Sancho, as he handled it, took it to be made of a goat, not to
say a kid, and looking at it he said, “And do you carry this with
you, señor?”
</p>
<p>
“Why, what are you thinking about?” said the other; “do
you take me for some paltry squire? I carry a better larder on my horse’s
croup than a general takes with him when he goes on a march.”
</p>
<p>
Sancho ate without requiring to be pressed, and in the dark bolted
mouthfuls like the knots on a tether, and said he, “You are a proper
trusty squire, one of the right sort, sumptuous and grand, as this banquet
shows, which, if it has not come here by magic art, at any rate has the
look of it; not like me, unlucky beggar, that have nothing more in my
alforjas than a scrap of cheese, so hard that one might brain a giant with
it, and, to keep it company, a few dozen carobs and as many more filberts
and walnuts; thanks to the austerity of my master, and the idea he has and
the rule he follows, that knights-errant must not live or sustain
themselves on anything except dried fruits and the herbs of the field.”
</p>
<p>
“By my faith, brother,” said he of the Grove, “my
stomach is not made for thistles, or wild pears, or roots of the woods;
let our masters do as they like, with their chivalry notions and laws, and
eat what those enjoin; I carry my prog-basket and this bota hanging to the
saddle-bow, whatever they may say; and it is such an object of worship
with me, and I love it so, that there is hardly a moment but I am kissing
and embracing it over and over again;” and so saying he thrust it
into Sancho’s hands, who raising it aloft pointed to his mouth,
gazed at the stars for a quarter of an hour; and when he had done drinking
let his head fall on one side, and giving a deep sigh, exclaimed, “Ah,
whoreson rogue, how catholic it is!”
</p>
<p>
“There, you see,” said he of the Grove, hearing Sancho’s
exclamation, “how you have called this wine whoreson by way of
praise.”
</p>
<p>
“Well,” said Sancho, “I own it, and I grant it is no
dishonour to call anyone whoreson when it is to be understood as praise.
But tell me, señor, by what you love best, is this Ciudad Real wine?”
</p>
<p>
“O rare wine-taster!” said he of the Grove; “nowhere
else indeed does it come from, and it has some years’ age too.”
</p>
<p>
“Leave me alone for that,” said Sancho; “never fear but
I’ll hit upon the place it came from somehow. What would you say,
sir squire, to my having such a great natural instinct in judging wines
that you have only to let me smell one and I can tell positively its
country, its kind, its flavour and soundness, the changes it will undergo,
and everything that appertains to a wine? But it is no wonder, for I have
had in my family, on my father’s side, the two best wine-tasters
that have been known in La Mancha for many a long year, and to prove it I’ll
tell you now a thing that happened them. They gave the two of them some
wine out of a cask, to try, asking their opinion as to the condition,
quality, goodness or badness of the wine. One of them tried it with the
tip of his tongue, the other did no more than bring it to his nose. The
first said the wine had a flavour of iron, the second said it had a
stronger flavour of cordovan. The owner said the cask was clean, and that
nothing had been added to the wine from which it could have got a flavour
of either iron or leather. Nevertheless, these two great wine-tasters held
to what they had said. Time went by, the wine was sold, and when they came
to clean out the cask, they found in it a small key hanging to a thong of
cordovan; see now if one who comes of the same stock has not a right to
give his opinion in such like cases.”
</p>
<p>
“Therefore, I say,” said he of the Grove, “let us give
up going in quest of adventures, and as we have loaves let us not go
looking for cakes, but return to our cribs, for God will find us there if
it be his will.”
</p>
<p>
“Until my master reaches Saragossa,” said Sancho, “I’ll
remain in his service; after that we’ll see.”
</p>
<p>
The end of it was that the two squires talked so much and drank so much
that sleep had to tie their tongues and moderate their thirst, for to
quench it was impossible; and so the pair of them fell asleep clinging to
the now nearly empty bota and with half-chewed morsels in their mouths;
and there we will leave them for the present, to relate what passed
between the Knight of the Grove and him of the Rueful Countenance.

<p>
Among the things that passed between Don Quixote and the Knight of the
Wood, the history tells us he of the Grove said to Don Quixote, “In
fine, sir knight, I would have you know that my destiny, or, more properly
speaking, my choice led me to fall in love with the peerless Casildea de
Vandalia. I call her peerless because she has no peer, whether it be in
bodily stature or in the supremacy of rank and beauty. This same Casildea,
then, that I speak of, requited my honourable passion and gentle
aspirations by compelling me, as his stepmother did Hercules, to engage in
many perils of various sorts, at the end of each promising me that, with
the end of the next, the object of my hopes should be attained; but my
labours have gone on increasing link by link until they are past counting,
nor do I know what will be the last one that is to be the beginning of the
accomplishment of my chaste desires. On one occasion she bade me go and
challenge the famous giantess of Seville, La Giralda by name, who is as
mighty and strong as if made of brass, and though never stirring from one
spot, is the most restless and changeable woman in the world. I came, I
saw, I conquered, and I made her stay quiet and behave herself, for
nothing but north winds blew for more than a week. Another time I was
ordered to lift those ancient stones, the mighty bulls of Guisando, an
enterprise that might more fitly be entrusted to porters than to knights.
Again, she bade me fling myself into the cavern of Cabra—an
unparalleled and awful peril—and bring her a minute account of all
that is concealed in those gloomy depths. I stopped the motion of the
Giralda, I lifted the bulls of Guisando, I flung myself into the cavern
and brought to light the secrets of its abyss; and my hopes are as dead as
dead can be, and her scorn and her commands as lively as ever. To be
brief, last of all she has commanded me to go through all the provinces of
Spain and compel all the knights-errant wandering therein to confess that
she surpasses all women alive to-day in beauty, and that I am the most
valiant and the most deeply enamoured knight on earth; in support of which
claim I have already travelled over the greater part of Spain, and have
there vanquished several knights who have dared to contradict me; but what
I most plume and pride myself upon is having vanquished in single combat
that so famous knight Don Quixote of La Mancha, and made him confess that
my Casildea is more beautiful than his Dulcinea; and in this one victory I
hold myself to have conquered all the knights in the world; for this Don
Quixote that I speak of has vanquished them all, and I having vanquished
him, his glory, his fame, and his honour have passed and are transferred
to my person; for
</p>
<p class="poem">
The more the vanquished hath of fair renown,<br>
The greater glory gilds the victor’s crown.
</p>
<p>
Thus the innumerable achievements of the said Don Quixote are now set down
to my account and have become mine.”
</p>
<p>
Don Quixote was amazed when he heard the Knight of the Grove, and was a
thousand times on the point of telling him he lied, and had the lie direct
already on the tip of his tongue; but he restrained himself as well as he
could, in order to force him to confess the lie with his own lips; so he
said to him quietly, “As to what you say, sir knight, about having
vanquished most of the knights of Spain, or even of the whole world, I say
nothing; but that you have vanquished Don Quixote of La Mancha I consider
doubtful; it may have been some other that resembled him, although there
are few like him.”
</p>
<p>
“How! not vanquished?” said he of the Grove; “by the
heaven that is above us I fought Don Quixote and overcame him and made him
yield; and he is a man of tall stature, gaunt features, long, lank limbs,
with hair turning grey, an aquiline nose rather hooked, and large black
drooping moustaches; he does battle under the name of ‘The
Countenance,’ and he has for squire a peasant called Sancho Panza;
he presses the loins and rules the reins of a famous steed called
Rocinante; and lastly, he has for the mistress of his will a certain
Dulcinea del Toboso, once upon a time called Aldonza Lorenzo, just as I
call mine Casildea de Vandalia because her name is Casilda and she is of
Andalusia. If all these tokens are not enough to vindicate the truth of
what I say, here is my sword, that will compel incredulity itself to give
credence to it.”
</p>
<p>
“Calm yourself, sir knight,” said Don Quixote, “and give
ear to what I am about to say to you. I would have you know that this Don
Quixote you speak of is the greatest friend I have in the world; so much
so that I may say I regard him in the same light as my own person; and
from the precise and clear indications you have given I cannot but think
that he must be the very one you have vanquished. On the other hand, I see
with my eyes and feel with my hands that it is impossible it can have been
the same; unless indeed it be that, as he has many enemies who are
enchanters, and one in particular who is always persecuting him, someone
of these may have taken his shape in order to allow himself to be
vanquished, so as to defraud him of the fame that his exalted achievements
as a knight have earned and acquired for him throughout the known world.
And in confirmation of this, I must tell you, too, that it is but ten
hours since these said enchanters his enemies transformed the shape and
person of the fair Dulcinea del Toboso into a foul and mean village lass,
and in the same way they must have transformed Don Quixote; and if all
this does not suffice to convince you of the truth of what I say, here is
Don Quixote himself, who will maintain it by arms, on foot or on horseback
or in any way you please.”
</p>
<p>
And so saying he stood up and laid his hand on his sword, waiting to see
what the Knight of the Grove would do, who in an equally calm voice said
in reply, “Pledges don’t distress a good payer; he who has
succeeded in vanquishing you once when transformed, Sir Don Quixote, may
fairly hope to subdue you in your own proper shape; but as it is not
becoming for knights to perform their feats of arms in the dark, like
highwaymen and bullies, let us wait till daylight, that the sun may behold
our deeds; and the conditions of our combat shall be that the vanquished
shall be at the victor’s disposal, to do all that he may enjoin,
provided the injunction be such as shall be becoming a knight.”
</p>
<p>
“I am more than satisfied with these conditions and terms,”
replied Don Quixote; and so saying, they betook themselves to where their
squires lay, and found them snoring, and in the same posture they were in
when sleep fell upon them. They roused them up, and bade them get the
horses ready, as at sunrise they were to engage in a bloody and arduous
single combat; at which intelligence Sancho was aghast and thunderstruck,
trembling for the safety of his master because of the mighty deeds he had
heard the squire of the Grove ascribe to his; but without a word the two
squires went in quest of their cattle; for by this time the three horses
and the ass had smelt one another out, and were all together.
</p>
<p>
On the way, he of the Grove said to Sancho, “You must know, brother,
that it is the custom with the fighting men of Andalusia, when they are
godfathers in any quarrel, not to stand idle with folded arms while their
godsons fight; I say so to remind you that while our masters are fighting,
we, too, have to fight, and knock one another to shivers.”
</p>
<p>
“That custom, sir squire,” replied Sancho, “may hold
good among those bullies and fighting men you talk of, but certainly not
among the squires of knights-errant; at least, I have never heard my
master speak of any custom of the sort, and he knows all the laws of
knight-errantry by heart; but granting it true that there is an express
law that squires are to fight while their masters are fighting, I don’t
mean to obey it, but to pay the penalty that may be laid on peacefully
minded squires like myself; for I am sure it cannot be more than two
pounds of wax, and I would rather pay that, for I know it will cost me
less than the lint I shall be at the expense of to mend my head, which I
look upon as broken and split already; there’s another thing that
makes it impossible for me to fight, that I have no sword, for I never
carried one in my life.”
</p>
<p>
“I know a good remedy for that,” said he of the Grove; “I
have here two linen bags of the same size; you shall take one, and I the
other, and we will fight at bag blows with equal arms.”
</p>
<p>
“If that’s the way, so be it with all my heart,” said
Sancho, “for that sort of battle will serve to knock the dust out of
us instead of hurting us.”
</p>
<p>
“That will not do,” said the other, “for we must put
into the bags, to keep the wind from blowing them away, half a dozen nice
smooth pebbles, all of the same weight; and in this way we shall be able
to baste one another without doing ourselves any harm or mischief.”
</p>
<p>
“Body of my father!” said Sancho, “see what marten and
sable, and pads of carded cotton he is putting into the bags, that our
heads may not be broken and our bones beaten to jelly! But even if they
are filled with toss silk, I can tell you, señor, I am not going to fight;
let our masters fight, that’s their lookout, and let us drink and
live; for time will take care to ease us of our lives, without our going
to look for fillips so that they may be finished off before their proper
time comes and they drop from ripeness.”
</p>
<p>
“Still,” returned he of the Grove, “we must fight, if it
be only for half an hour.”
</p>
<p>
“By no means,” said Sancho; “I am not going to be so
discourteous or so ungrateful as to have any quarrel, be it ever so small,
with one I have eaten and drunk with; besides, who the devil could bring
himself to fight in cold blood, without anger or provocation?”
</p>
<p>
“I can remedy that entirely,” said he of the Grove, “and
in this way: before we begin the battle, I will come up to your worship
fair and softly, and give you three or four buffets, with which I shall
stretch you at my feet and rouse your anger, though it were sleeping
sounder than a dormouse.”
</p>
<p>
“To match that plan,” said Sancho, “I have another that
is not a whit behind it; I will take a cudgel, and before your worship
comes near enough to waken my anger I will send yours so sound to sleep
with whacks, that it won’t waken unless it be in the other world,
where it is known that I am not a man to let my face be handled by anyone;
let each look out for the arrow—though the surer way would be to let
everyone’s anger sleep, for nobody knows the heart of anyone, and a
man may come for wool and go back shorn; God gave his blessing to peace
and his curse to quarrels; if a hunted cat, surrounded and hard pressed,
turns into a lion, God knows what I, who am a man, may turn into; and so
from this time forth I warn you, sir squire, that all the harm and
mischief that may come of our quarrel will be put down to your account.”
</p>
<p>
“Very good,” said he of the Grove; “God will send the
dawn and we shall be all right.”
</p>
<p>
And now gay-plumaged birds of all sorts began to warble in the trees, and
with their varied and gladsome notes seemed to welcome and salute the
fresh morn that was beginning to show the beauty of her countenance at the
gates and balconies of the east, shaking from her locks a profusion of
liquid pearls; in which dulcet moisture bathed, the plants, too, seemed to
shed and shower down a pearly spray, the willows distilled sweet manna,
the fountains laughed, the brooks babbled, the woods rejoiced, and the
meadows arrayed themselves in all their glory at her coming. But hardly
had the light of day made it possible to see and distinguish things, when
the first object that presented itself to the eyes of Sancho Panza was the
squire of the Grove’s nose, which was so big that it almost
overshadowed his whole body. It is, in fact, stated, that it was of
enormous size, hooked in the middle, covered with warts, and of a mulberry
colour like an egg-plant; it hung down two fingers’ length below his
mouth, and the size, the colour, the warts, and the bend of it, made his
face so hideous, that Sancho, as he looked at him, began to tremble hand
and foot like a child in convulsions, and he vowed in his heart to let
himself be given two hundred buffets, sooner than be provoked to fight
that monster. Don Quixote examined his adversary, and found that he
already had his helmet on and visor lowered, so that he could not see his
face; he observed, however, that he was a sturdily built man, but not very
tall in stature. Over his armour he wore a surcoat or cassock of what
seemed to be the finest cloth of gold, all bespangled with glittering
mirrors like little moons, which gave him an extremely gallant and
splendid appearance; above his helmet fluttered a great quantity of
plumes, green, yellow, and white, and his lance, which was leaning against
a tree, was very long and stout, and had a steel point more than a palm in
length.
</p>
<p>
Don Quixote observed all, and took note of all, and from what he saw and
observed he concluded that the said knight must be a man of great
strength, but he did not for all that give way to fear, like Sancho Panza;
on the contrary, with a composed and dauntless air, he said to the Knight
of the Mirrors, “If, sir knight, your great eagerness to fight has
not banished your courtesy, by it I would entreat you to raise your visor
a little, in order that I may see if the comeliness of your countenance
corresponds with that of your equipment.”
</p>
<p>
“Whether you come victorious or vanquished out of this emprise, sir
knight,” replied he of the Mirrors, “you will have more than
enough time and leisure to see me; and if now I do not comply with your
request, it is because it seems to me I should do a serious wrong to the
fair Casildea de Vandalia in wasting time while I stopped to raise my
visor before compelling you to confess what you are already aware I
maintain.”
</p>
<p>
“Well then,” said Don Quixote, “while we are mounting
you can at least tell me if I am that Don Quixote whom you said you
vanquished.”
</p>
<p>
“To that we answer you,” said he of the Mirrors, “that
you are as like the very knight I vanquished as one egg is like another,
but as you say enchanters persecute you, I will not venture to say
positively whether you are the said person or not.”
</p>
<p>
“That,” said Don Quixote, “is enough to convince me that
you are under a deception; however, entirely to relieve you of it, let our
horses be brought, and in less time than it would take you to raise your
visor, if God, my lady, and my arm stand me in good stead, I shall see
your face, and you shall see that I am not the vanquished Don Quixote you
take me to be.”
</p>
<p>
With this, cutting short the colloquy, they mounted, and Don Quixote
wheeled Rocinante round in order to take a proper distance to charge back
upon his adversary, and he of the Mirrors did the same; but Don Quixote
had not moved away twenty paces when he heard himself called by the other,
and, each returning half-way, he of the Mirrors said to him, “Remember,
sir knight, that the terms of our combat are, that the vanquished, as I
said before, shall be at the victor’s disposal.”
</p>
<p>
“I am aware of it already,” said Don Quixote; “provided
what is commanded and imposed upon the vanquished be things that do not
transgress the limits of chivalry.”
</p>
<p>
“That is understood,” replied he of the Mirrors.
</p>
<p>
At this moment the extraordinary nose of the squire presented itself to
Don Quixote’s view, and he was no less amazed than Sancho at the
sight; insomuch that he set him down as a monster of some kind, or a human
being of some new species or unearthly breed. Sancho, seeing his master
retiring to run his course, did not like to be left alone with the nosy
man, fearing that with one flap of that nose on his own the battle would
be all over for him and he would be left stretched on the ground, either
by the blow or with fright; so he ran after his master, holding on to
Rocinante’s stirrup-leather, and when it seemed to him time to turn
about, he said, “I implore of your worship, señor, before you turn
to charge, to help me up into this cork tree, from which I will be able to
witness the gallant encounter your worship is going to have with this
knight, more to my taste and better than from the ground.”
</p>
<p>
“It seems to me rather, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “that
thou wouldst mount a scaffold in order to see the bulls without danger.”
</p>
<p>
“To tell the truth,” returned Sancho, “the monstrous
nose of that squire has filled me with fear and terror, and I dare not
stay near him.”
</p>
<p>
“It is,” said Don Quixote, “such a one that were I not
what I am it would terrify me too; so, come, I will help thee up where
thou wilt.”
</p>
<p>
While Don Quixote waited for Sancho to mount into the cork tree he of the
Mirrors took as much ground as he considered requisite, and, supposing Don
Quixote to have done the same, without waiting for any sound of trumpet or
other signal to direct them, he wheeled his horse, which was not more
agile or better-looking than Rocinante, and at his top speed, which was an
easy trot, he proceeded to charge his enemy; seeing him, however, engaged
in putting Sancho up, he drew rein, and halted in mid career, for which
his horse was very grateful, as he was already unable to go. Don Quixote,
fancying that his foe was coming down upon him flying, drove his spurs
vigorously into Rocinante’s lean flanks and made him scud along in
such style that the history tells us that on this occasion only was he
known to make something like running, for on all others it was a simple
trot with him; and with this unparalleled fury he bore down where he of
the Mirrors stood digging his spurs into his horse up to buttons, without
being able to make him stir a finger’s length from the spot where he
had come to a standstill in his course. At this lucky moment and crisis,
Don Quixote came upon his adversary, in trouble with his horse, and
embarrassed with his lance, which he either could not manage, or had no
time to lay in rest. Don Quixote, however, paid no attention to these
difficulties, and in perfect safety to himself and without any risk
encountered him of the Mirrors with such force that he brought him to the
ground in spite of himself over the haunches of his horse, and with so
heavy a fall that he lay to all appearance dead, not stirring hand or
foot. The instant Sancho saw him fall he slid down from the cork tree, and
made all haste to where his master was, who, dismounting from Rocinante,
went and stood over him of the Mirrors, and unlacing his helmet to see if
he was dead, and to give him air if he should happen to be alive, he saw—who
can say what he saw, without filling all who hear it with astonishment,
wonder, and awe? He saw, the history says, the very countenance, the very
face, the very look, the very physiognomy, the very effigy, the very image
of the bachelor Samson Carrasco! As soon as he saw it he called out in a
loud voice, “Make haste here, Sancho, and behold what thou art to
see but not to believe; quick, my son, and learn what magic can do, and
wizards and enchanters are capable of.”
</p>
<p>
Sancho came up, and when he saw the countenance of the bachelor Carrasco,
he fell to crossing himself a thousand times, and blessing himself as many
more. All this time the prostrate knight showed no signs of life, and
Sancho said to Don Quixote, “It is my opinion, señor, that in any
case your worship should take and thrust your sword into the mouth of this
one here that looks like the bachelor Samson Carrasco; perhaps in him you
will kill one of your enemies, the enchanters.”
</p>
<p>
“Thy advice is not bad,” said Don Quixote, “for of
enemies the fewer the better;” and he was drawing his sword to carry
into effect Sancho’s counsel and suggestion, when the squire of the
Mirrors came up, now without the nose which had made him so hideous, and
cried out in a loud voice, “Mind what you are about, Señor Don
Quixote; that is your friend, the bachelor Samson Carrasco, you have at
your feet, and I am his squire.”
</p>
<p>
“And the nose?” said Sancho, seeing him without the hideous
feature he had before; to which he replied, “I have it here in my
pocket,” and putting his hand into his right pocket, he pulled out a
masquerade nose of varnished pasteboard of the make already described; and
Sancho, examining him more and more closely, exclaimed aloud in a voice of
amazement, “Holy Mary be good to me! Isn’t it Tom Cecial, my
neighbour and gossip?”
</p>
<p>
“Why, to be sure I am!” returned the now unnosed squire;
“Tom Cecial I am, gossip and friend Sancho Panza; and I’ll
tell you presently the means and tricks and falsehoods by which I have
been brought here; but in the meantime, beg and entreat of your master not
to touch, maltreat, wound, or slay the Knight of the Mirrors whom he has
at his feet; because, beyond all dispute, it is the rash and ill-advised
bachelor Samson Carrasco, our fellow townsman.”
</p>
<p>
At this moment he of the Mirrors came to himself, and Don Quixote
perceiving it, held the naked point of his sword over his face, and said
to him, “You are a dead man, knight, unless you confess that the
peerless Dulcinea del Toboso excels your Casildea de Vandalia in beauty;
and in addition to this you must promise, if you should survive this
encounter and fall, to go to the city of El Toboso and present yourself
before her on my behalf, that she deal with you according to her good
pleasure; and if she leaves you free to do yours, you are in like manner
to return and seek me out (for the trail of my mighty deeds will serve you
as a guide to lead you to where I may be), and tell me what may have
passed between you and her—conditions which, in accordance with what
we stipulated before our combat, do not transgress the just limits of
knight-errantry.”
</p>
<p>
“I confess,” said the fallen knight, “that the dirty
tattered shoe of the lady Dulcinea del Toboso is better than the
ill-combed though clean beard of Casildea; and I promise to go and to
return from her presence to yours, and to give you a full and particular
account of all you demand of me.”
</p>
<p>
“You must also confess and believe,” added Don Quixote,
“that the knight you vanquished was not and could not be Don Quixote
of La Mancha, but someone else in his likeness, just as I confess and
believe that you, though you seem to be the bachelor Samson Carrasco, are
not so, but some other resembling him, whom my enemies have here put
before me in his shape, in order that I may restrain and moderate the
vehemence of my wrath, and make a gentle use of the glory of my victory.”
</p>
<p>
“I confess, hold, and think everything to be as you believe, hold,
and think it,” the crippled knight; “let me rise, I entreat
you; if, indeed, the shock of my fall will allow me, for it has left me in
a sorry plight enough.”
</p>
<p>
Don Quixote helped him to rise, with the assistance of his squire Tom
Cecial; from whom Sancho never took his eyes, and to whom he put
questions, the replies to which furnished clear proof that he was really
and truly the Tom Cecial he said; but the impression made on Sancho’s
mind by what his master said about the enchanters having changed the face
of the Knight of the Mirrors into that of the bachelor Samson Carrasco,
would not permit him to believe what he saw with his eyes. In fine, both
master and man remained under the delusion; and, down in the mouth, and
out of luck, he of the Mirrors and his squire parted from Don Quixote and
Sancho, he meaning to go look for some village where he could plaster and
strap his ribs. Don Quixote and Sancho resumed their journey to Saragossa,
and on it the history leaves them in order that it may tell who the Knight
of the Mirrors and his long-nosed squire were.

<p>
Don Quixote went off satisfied, elated, and vain-glorious in the highest
degree at having won a victory over such a valiant knight as he fancied
him of the Mirrors to be, and one from whose knightly word he expected to
learn whether the enchantment of his lady still continued; inasmuch as the
said vanquished knight was bound, under the penalty of ceasing to be one,
to return and render him an account of what took place between him and
her. But Don Quixote was of one mind, he of the Mirrors of another, for he
just then had no thought of anything but finding some village where he
could plaster himself, as has been said already. The history goes on to
say, then, that when the bachelor Samson Carrasco recommended Don Quixote
to resume his knight-errantry which he had laid aside, it was in
consequence of having been previously in conclave with the curate and the
barber on the means to be adopted to induce Don Quixote to stay at home in
peace and quiet without worrying himself with his ill-starred adventures;
at which consultation it was decided by the unanimous vote of all, and on
the special advice of Carrasco, that Don Quixote should be allowed to go,
as it seemed impossible to restrain him, and that Samson should sally
forth to meet him as a knight-errant, and do battle with him, for there
would be no difficulty about a cause, and vanquish him, that being looked
upon as an easy matter; and that it should be agreed and settled that the
vanquished was to be at the mercy of the victor. Then, Don Quixote being
vanquished, the bachelor knight was to command him to return to his
village and his house, and not quit it for two years, or until he received
further orders from him; all which it was clear Don Quixote would
unhesitatingly obey, rather than contravene or fail to observe the laws of
chivalry; and during the period of his seclusion he might perhaps forget
his folly, or there might be an opportunity of discovering some ready
remedy for his madness. Carrasco undertook the task, and Tom Cecial, a
gossip and neighbour of Sancho Panza’s, a lively, feather-headed
fellow, offered himself as his squire. Carrasco armed himself in the
fashion described, and Tom Cecial, that he might not be known by his
gossip when they met, fitted on over his own natural nose the false
masquerade one that has been mentioned; and so they followed the same
route Don Quixote took, and almost came up with him in time to be present
at the adventure of the cart of Death and finally encountered them in the
grove, where all that the sagacious reader has been reading about took
place; and had it not been for the extraordinary fancies of Don Quixote,
and his conviction that the bachelor was not the bachelor, señor bachelor
would have been incapacitated for ever from taking his degree of
licentiate, all through not finding nests where he thought to find birds.
</p>
<p>
Tom Cecial, seeing how ill they had succeeded, and what a sorry end their
expedition had come to, said to the bachelor, “Sure enough, Señor
Samson Carrasco, we are served right; it is easy enough to plan and set
about an enterprise, but it is often a difficult matter to come well out
of it. Don Quixote a madman, and we sane; he goes off laughing, safe, and
sound, and you are left sore and sorry! I’d like to know now which
is the madder, he who is so because he cannot help it, or he who is so of
his own choice?”
</p>
<p>
To which Samson replied, “The difference between the two sorts of
madmen is, that he who is so will he nil he, will be one always, while he
who is so of his own accord can leave off being one whenever he likes.”
</p>
<p>
“In that case,” said Tom Cecial, “I was a madman of my
own accord when I volunteered to become your squire, and, of my own
accord, I’ll leave off being one and go home.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s your affair,” returned Samson, “but to
suppose that I am going home until I have given Don Quixote a thrashing is
absurd; and it is not any wish that he may recover his senses that will
make me hunt him out now, but a wish for the sore pain I am in with my
ribs won’t let me entertain more charitable thoughts.”
</p>
<p>
Thus discoursing, the pair proceeded until they reached a town where it
was their good luck to find a bone-setter, with whose help the unfortunate
Samson was cured. Tom Cecial left him and went home, while he stayed
behind meditating vengeance; and the history will return to him again at
the proper time, so as not to omit making merry with Don Quixote now.

</p>
<p>
Don Quixote pursued his journey in the high spirits, satisfaction, and
self-complacency already described, fancying himself the most valorous
knight-errant of the age in the world because of his late victory. All the
adventures that could befall him from that time forth he regarded as
already done and brought to a happy issue; he made light of enchantments
and enchanters; he thought no more of the countless drubbings that had
been administered to him in the course of his knight-errantry, nor of the
volley of stones that had levelled half his teeth, nor of the ingratitude
of the galley slaves, nor of the audacity of the Yanguesans and the shower
of stakes that fell upon him; in short, he said to himself that could he
discover any means, mode, or way of disenchanting his lady Dulcinea, he
would not envy the highest fortune that the most fortunate knight-errant
of yore ever reached or could reach.
</p>
<p>
He was going along entirely absorbed in these fancies, when Sancho said to
him, “Isn’t it odd, señor, that I have still before my eyes
that monstrous enormous nose of my gossip, Tom Cecial?”
</p>
<p>
“And dost thou, then, believe, Sancho,” said Don Quixote,
“that the Knight of the Mirrors was the bachelor Carrasco, and his
squire Tom Cecial thy gossip?”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know what to say to that,” replied Sancho;
“all I know is that the tokens he gave me about my own house, wife
and children, nobody else but himself could have given me; and the face,
once the nose was off, was the very face of Tom Cecial, as I have seen it
many a time in my town and next door to my own house; and the sound of the
voice was just the same.”
</p>
<p>
“Let us reason the matter, Sancho,” said Don Quixote. “Come
now, by what process of thinking can it be supposed that the bachelor
Samson Carrasco would come as a knight-errant, in arms offensive and
defensive, to fight with me? Have I ever been by any chance his enemy?
Have I ever given him any occasion to owe me a grudge? Am I his rival, or
does he profess arms, that he should envy the fame I have acquired in
them?”
</p>
<p>
“Well, but what are we to say, señor,” returned Sancho,
“about that knight, whoever he is, being so like the bachelor
Carrasco, and his squire so like my gossip, Tom Cecial? And if that be
enchantment, as your worship says, was there no other pair in the world
for them to take the likeness of?”
</p>
<p>
“It is all,” said Don Quixote, “a scheme and plot of the
malignant magicians that persecute me, who, foreseeing that I was to be
victorious in the conflict, arranged that the vanquished knight should
display the countenance of my friend the bachelor, in order that the
friendship I bear him should interpose to stay the edge of my sword and
might of my arm, and temper the just wrath of my heart; so that he who
sought to take my life by fraud and falsehood should save his own. And to
prove it, thou knowest already, Sancho, by experience which cannot lie or
deceive, how easy it is for enchanters to change one countenance into
another, turning fair into foul, and foul into fair; for it is not two
days since thou sawest with thine own eyes the beauty and elegance of the
peerless Dulcinea in all its perfection and natural harmony, while I saw
her in the repulsive and mean form of a coarse country wench, with
cataracts in her eyes and a foul smell in her mouth; and when the perverse
enchanter ventured to effect so wicked a transformation, it is no wonder
if he effected that of Samson Carrasco and thy gossip in order to snatch
the glory of victory out of my grasp. For all that, however, I console
myself, because, after all, in whatever shape he may have been, I have
been victorious over my enemy.”
</p>
<p>
“God knows what’s the truth of it all,” said Sancho; and
knowing as he did that the transformation of Dulcinea had been a device
and imposition of his own, his master’s illusions were not
satisfactory to him; but he did not like to reply lest he should say
something that might disclose his trickery.
</p>
<p>
As they were engaged in this conversation they were overtaken by a man who
was following the same road behind them, mounted on a very handsome
flea-bitten mare, and dressed in a gaban of fine green cloth, with tawny
velvet facings, and a montera of the same velvet. The trappings of the
mare were of the field and jineta fashion, and of mulberry colour and
green. He carried a Moorish cutlass hanging from a broad green and gold
baldric; the buskins were of the same make as the baldric; the spurs were
not gilt, but lacquered green, and so brightly polished that, matching as
they did the rest of his apparel, they looked better than if they had been
of pure gold.
</p>
<p>
When the traveller came up with them he saluted them courteously, and
spurring his mare was passing them without stopping, but Don Quixote
called out to him, “Gallant sir, if so be your worship is going our
road, and has no occasion for speed, it would be a pleasure to me if we
were to join company.”
</p>
<p>
“In truth,” replied he on the mare, “I would not pass
you so hastily but for fear that horse might turn restive in the company
of my mare.”
</p>
<p>
“You may safely hold in your mare, señor,” said Sancho in
reply to this, “for our horse is the most virtuous and well-behaved
horse in the world; he never does anything wrong on such occasions, and
the only time he misbehaved, my master and I suffered for it sevenfold; I
say again your worship may pull up if you like; for if she was offered to
him between two plates the horse would not hanker after her.”
</p>
<p>
The traveller drew rein, amazed at the trim and features of Don Quixote,
who rode without his helmet, which Sancho carried like a valise in front
of Dapple’s pack-saddle; and if the man in green examined Don
Quixote closely, still more closely did Don Quixote examine the man in
green, who struck him as being a man of intelligence. In appearance he was
about fifty years of age, with but few grey hairs, an aquiline cast of
features, and an expression between grave and gay; and his dress and
accoutrements showed him to be a man of good condition. What he in green
thought of Don Quixote of La Mancha was that a man of that sort and shape
he had never yet seen; he marvelled at the length of his hair, his lofty
stature, the lankness and sallowness of his countenance, his armour, his
bearing and his gravity—a figure and picture such as had not been
seen in those regions for many a long day.
</p>
<p>
Don Quixote saw very plainly the attention with which the traveller was
regarding him, and read his curiosity in his astonishment; and courteous
as he was and ready to please everybody, before the other could ask him
any question he anticipated him by saying, “The appearance I present
to your worship being so strange and so out of the common, I should not be
surprised if it filled you with wonder; but you will cease to wonder when
I tell you, as I do, that I am one of those knights who, as people say, go
seeking adventures. I have left my home, I have mortgaged my estate, I
have given up my comforts, and committed myself to the arms of Fortune, to
bear me whithersoever she may please. My desire was to bring to life again
knight-errantry, now dead, and for some time past, stumbling here, falling
there, now coming down headlong, now raising myself up again, I have
carried out a great portion of my design, succouring widows, protecting
maidens, and giving aid to wives, orphans, and minors, the proper and
natural duty of knights-errant; and, therefore, because of my many valiant
and Christian achievements, I have been already found worthy to make my
way in print to well-nigh all, or most, of the nations of the earth.
Thirty thousand volumes of my history have been printed, and it is on the
high-road to be printed thirty thousand thousands of times, if heaven does
not put a stop to it. In short, to sum up all in a few words, or in a
single one, I may tell you I am Don Quixote of La Mancha, otherwise called
‘The Knight of the Rueful Countenance;’ for though self-praise
is degrading, I must perforce sound my own sometimes, that is to say, when
there is no one at hand to do it for me. So that, gentle sir, neither this
horse, nor this lance, nor this shield, nor this squire, nor all these
arms put together, nor the sallowness of my countenance, nor my gaunt
leanness, will henceforth astonish you, now that you know who I am and
what profession I follow.”
</p>
<p>
With these words Don Quixote held his peace, and, from the time he took to
answer, the man in green seemed to be at a loss for a reply; after a long
pause, however, he said to him, “You were right when you saw
curiosity in my amazement, sir knight; but you have not succeeded in
removing the astonishment I feel at seeing you; for although you say,
señor, that knowing who you are ought to remove it, it has not done so; on
the contrary, now that I know, I am left more amazed and astonished than
before. What! is it possible that there are knights-errant in the world in
these days, and histories of real chivalry printed? I cannot realise the
fact that there can be anyone on earth now-a-days who aids widows, or
protects maidens, or defends wives, or succours orphans; nor should I
believe it had I not seen it in your worship with my own eyes. Blessed be
heaven! for by means of this history of your noble and genuine chivalrous
deeds, which you say has been printed, the countless stories of fictitious
knights-errant with which the world is filled, so much to the injury of
morality and the prejudice and discredit of good histories, will have been
driven into oblivion.”
</p>
<p>
“There is a good deal to be said on that point,” said Don
Quixote, “as to whether the histories of the knights-errant are
fiction or not.”
</p>
<p>
“Why, is there anyone who doubts that those histories are false?”
said the man in green.
</p>
<p>
“I doubt it,” said Don Quixote, “but never mind that
just now; if our journey lasts long enough, I trust in God I shall show
your worship that you do wrong in going with the stream of those who
regard it as a matter of certainty that they are not true.”
</p>
<p>
From this last observation of Don Quixote’s, the traveller began to
have a suspicion that he was some crazy being, and was waiting for him to
confirm it by something further; but before they could turn to any new
subject Don Quixote begged him to tell him who he was, since he himself
had rendered account of his station and life. To this, he in the green
gaban replied “I, Sir Knight of the Rueful Countenance, am a
gentleman by birth, native of the village where, please God, we are going
to dine to-day; I am more than fairly well off, and my name is Don Diego de
Miranda. I pass my life with my wife, children, and friends; my pursuits
are hunting and fishing, but I keep neither hawks nor greyhounds, nothing
but a tame partridge or a bold ferret or two; I have six dozen or so of
books, some in our mother tongue, some Latin, some of them history, others
devotional; those of chivalry have not as yet crossed the threshold of my
door; I am more given to turning over the profane than the devotional, so
long as they are books of honest entertainment that charm by their style
and attract and interest by the invention they display, though of these
there are very few in Spain. Sometimes I dine with my neighbours and
friends, and often invite them; my entertainments are neat and well served
without stint of anything. I have no taste for tattle, nor do I allow
tattling in my presence; I pry not into my neighbours’ lives, nor
have I lynx-eyes for what others do. I hear mass every day; I share my
substance with the poor, making no display of good works, lest I let
hypocrisy and vainglory, those enemies that subtly take possession of the
most watchful heart, find an entrance into mine. I strive to make peace
between those whom I know to be at variance; I am the devoted servant of
Our Lady, and my trust is ever in the infinite mercy of God our Lord.”
</p>
<p>
Sancho listened with the greatest attention to the account of the
gentleman’s life and occupation; and thinking it a good and a holy
life, and that he who led it ought to work miracles, he threw himself off
Dapple, and running in haste seized his right stirrup and kissed his foot
again and again with a devout heart and almost with tears.
</p>
<p>
Seeing this the gentleman asked him, “What are you about, brother?
What are these kisses for?”
</p>
<p>
“Let me kiss,” said Sancho, “for I think your worship is
the first saint in the saddle I ever saw all the days of my life.”
</p>
<p>
“I am no saint,” replied the gentleman, “but a great
sinner; but you are, brother, for you must be a good fellow, as your
simplicity shows.”
</p>
<p>
Sancho went back and regained his pack-saddle, having extracted a laugh
from his master’s profound melancholy, and excited fresh amazement
in Don Diego. Don Quixote then asked him how many children he had, and
observed that one of the things wherein the ancient philosophers, who were
without the true knowledge of God, placed the <i>summum bonum</i> was in the
gifts of nature, in those of fortune, in having many friends, and many and
good children.
</p>
<p>
“I, Señor Don Quixote,” answered the gentleman, “have
one son, without whom, perhaps, I should count myself happier than I am,
not because he is a bad son, but because he is not so good as I could
wish. He is eighteen years of age; he has been for six at Salamanca
studying Latin and Greek, and when I wished him to turn to the study of
other sciences I found him so wrapped up in that of poetry (if that can be
called a science) that there is no getting him to take kindly to the law,
which I wished him to study, or to theology, the queen of them all. I
would like him to be an honour to his family, as we live in days when our
kings liberally reward learning that is virtuous and worthy; for learning
without virtue is a pearl on a dunghill. He spends the whole day in
settling whether Homer expressed himself correctly or not in such and such
a line of the Iliad, whether Martial was indecent or not in such and such
an epigram, whether such and such lines of Virgil are to be understood in
this way or in that; in short, all his talk is of the works of these
poets, and those of Horace, Perseus, Juvenal, and Tibullus; for of the
moderns in our own language he makes no great account; but with all his
seeming indifference to Spanish poetry, just now his thoughts are absorbed
in making a gloss on four lines that have been sent him from Salamanca,
which I suspect are for some poetical tournament.”
</p>
<p>
To all this Don Quixote said in reply, “Children, señor, are portions of
their parents’ bowels, and therefore, be they good or bad, are to be
loved as we love the souls that give us life; it is for the parents to guide
them from infancy in the ways of virtue, propriety, and worthy Christian
conduct, so that when grown up they may be the staff of their parents’
old age, and the glory of their posterity; and to force them to study this or
that science I do not think wise, though it may be no harm to persuade them;
and when there is no need to study for the sake of <i>pane lucrando</i>, and it
is the student’s good fortune that heaven has given him parents who
provide him with it, it would be my advice to them to let him pursue whatever
science they may see him most inclined to; and though that of poetry is less
useful than pleasurable, it is not one of those that bring discredit upon the
possessor. Poetry, gentle sir, is, as I take it, like a tender young maiden of
supreme beauty, to array, bedeck, and adorn whom is the task of several other
maidens, who are all the rest of the sciences; and she must avail herself of
the help of all, and all derive their lustre from her. But this maiden will not
bear to be handled, nor dragged through the streets, nor exposed either at the
corners of the market-places, or in the closets of palaces. She is the product
of an Alchemy of such virtue that he who is able to practise it, will turn her
into pure gold of inestimable worth. He that possesses her must keep her within
bounds, not permitting her to break out in ribald satires or soulless sonnets.
She must on no account be offered for sale, unless, indeed, it be in heroic
poems, moving tragedies, or sprightly and ingenious comedies. She must not be
touched by the buffoons, nor by the ignorant vulgar, incapable of comprehending
or appreciating her hidden treasures. And do not suppose, señor, that I apply
the term vulgar here merely to plebeians and the lower orders; for everyone who
is ignorant, be he lord or prince, may and should be included among the vulgar.
He, then, who shall embrace and cultivate poetry under the conditions I have
named, shall become famous, and his name honoured throughout all the civilised
nations of the earth. And with regard to what you say, señor, of your son
having no great opinion of Spanish poetry, I am inclined to think that he is
not quite right there, and for this reason: the great poet Homer did not write
in Latin, because he was a Greek, nor did Virgil write in Greek, because he was
a Latin; in short, all the ancient poets wrote in the language they imbibed
with their mother’s milk, and never went in quest of foreign ones to
express their sublime conceptions; and that being so, the usage should in
justice extend to all nations, and the German poet should not be undervalued
because he writes in his own language, nor the Castilian, nor even the
Biscayan, for writing in his. But your son, señor, I suspect, is not prejudiced
against Spanish poetry, but against those poets who are mere Spanish verse
writers, without any knowledge of other languages or sciences to adorn and give
life and vigour to their natural inspiration; and yet even in this he may be
wrong; for, according to a true belief, a poet is born one; that is to say, the
poet by nature comes forth a poet from his mother’s womb; and following
the bent that heaven has bestowed upon him, without the aid of study or art, he
produces things that show how truly he spoke who said, ‘<i>Est Deus in
nobis</i>,’ etc. At the same time, I say that the poet by nature who
calls in art to his aid will be a far better poet, and will surpass him who
tries to be one relying upon his knowledge of art alone. The reason is, that
art does not surpass nature, but only brings it to perfection; and thus, nature
combined with art, and art with nature, will produce a perfect poet. To bring
my argument to a close, I would say then, gentle sir, let your son go on as his
star leads him, for being so studious as he seems to be, and having already
successfully surmounted the first step of the sciences, which is that of the
languages, with their help he will by his own exertions reach the summit of
polite literature, which so well becomes an independent gentleman, and adorns,
honours, and distinguishes him, as much as the mitre does the bishop, or the
gown the learned counsellor. If your son write satires reflecting on the honour
of others, chide and correct him, and tear them up; but if he compose
discourses in which he rebukes vice in general, in the style of Horace, and
with elegance like his, commend him; for it is legitimate for a poet to write
against envy and lash the envious in his verse, and the other vices too,
provided he does not single out individuals; there are, however, poets who, for
the sake of saying something spiteful, would run the risk of being banished to
the coast of Pontus. If the poet be pure in his morals, he will be pure in his
verses too; the pen is the tongue of the mind, and as the thought engendered
there, so will be the things that it writes down. And when kings and princes
observe this marvellous science of poetry in wise, virtuous, and thoughtful
subjects, they honour, value, exalt them, and even crown them with the leaves
of that tree which the thunderbolt strikes not, as if to show that they whose
brows are honoured and adorned with such a crown are not to be assailed by
anyone.”
</p>
<p>
He of the green gaban was filled with astonishment at Don Quixote’s
argument, so much so that he began to abandon the notion he had taken up
about his being crazy. But in the middle of the discourse, it being not
very much to his taste, Sancho had turned aside out of the road to beg a
little milk from some shepherds, who were milking their ewes hard by; and
just as the gentleman, highly pleased, was about to renew the
conversation, Don Quixote, raising his head, perceived a cart covered with
royal flags coming along the road they were travelling; and persuaded that
this must be some new adventure, he called aloud to Sancho to come and
bring him his helmet. Sancho, hearing himself called, quitted the
shepherds, and, prodding Dapple vigorously, came up to his master, to whom
there fell a terrific and desperate adventure.

The history tells that when Don Quixote called out to Sancho to bring him
his helmet, Sancho was buying some curds the shepherds agreed to sell him,
and flurried by the great haste his master was in did not know what to do
with them or what to carry them in; so, not to lose them, for he had
already paid for them, he thought it best to throw them into his master’s
helmet, and acting on this bright idea he went to see what his master
wanted with him. He, as he approached, exclaimed to him:
</p>
<p>
“Give me that helmet, my friend, for either I know little of
adventures, or what I observe yonder is one that will, and does, call upon
me to arm myself.”
</p>
<p>
He of the green gaban, on hearing this, looked in all directions, but
could perceive nothing, except a cart coming towards them with two or
three small flags, which led him to conclude it must be carrying treasure
of the King’s, and he said so to Don Quixote. He, however, would not
believe him, being always persuaded and convinced that all that happened
to him must be adventures and still more adventures; so he replied to the
gentleman, “He who is prepared has his battle half fought; nothing
is lost by my preparing myself, for I know by experience that I have
enemies, visible and invisible, and I know not when, or where, or at what
moment, or in what shapes they will attack me;” and turning to
Sancho, he called for his helmet; and Sancho, as he had no time to take
out the curds, had to give it just as it was. Don Quixote took it, and
without perceiving what was in it thrust it down in hot haste upon his
head; but as the curds were pressed and squeezed the whey began to run all
over his face and beard, whereat he was so startled that he cried out to
Sancho:
</p>
<p>
“Sancho, what’s this? I think my head is softening, or my
brains are melting, or I am sweating from head to foot! If I am sweating
it is not indeed from fear. I am convinced beyond a doubt that the
adventure which is about to befall me is a terrible one. Give me something
to wipe myself with, if thou hast it, for this profuse sweat is blinding
me.”
</p>
<p>
Sancho held his tongue, and gave him a cloth, and gave thanks to God at
the same time that his master had not found out what was the matter. Don
Quixote then wiped himself, and took off his helmet to see what it was
that made his head feel so cool, and seeing all that white mash inside his
helmet he put it to his nose, and as soon as he had smelt it he exclaimed:
</p>
<p>
“By the life of my lady Dulcinea del Toboso, but it is curds thou
hast put here, thou treacherous, impudent, ill-mannered squire!”
</p>
<p>
To which, with great composure and pretended innocence, Sancho replied,
“If they are curds let me have them, your worship, and I’ll
eat them; but let the devil eat them, for it must have been he who put
them there. I dare to dirty your helmet! You have guessed the offender
finely! Faith, sir, by the light God gives me, it seems I must have
enchanters too, that persecute me as a creature and limb of your worship,
and they must have put that nastiness there in order to provoke your
patience to anger, and make you baste my ribs as you are wont to do. Well,
this time, indeed, they have missed their aim, for I trust to my master’s
good sense to see that I have got no curds or milk, or anything of the
sort; and that if I had it is in my stomach I would put it and not in the
helmet.”
</p>
<p>
“May be so,” said Don Quixote. All this the gentleman was
observing, and with astonishment, more especially when, after having wiped
himself clean, his head, face, beard, and helmet, Don Quixote put it on,
and settling himself firmly in his stirrups, easing his sword in the
scabbard, and grasping his lance, he cried, “Now, come who will,
