here am I, ready to try conclusions with Satan himself in person!”
</p>
<p>
By this time the cart with the flags had come up, unattended by anyone
except the carter on a mule, and a man sitting in front. Don Quixote
planted himself before it and said, “Whither are you going,
brothers? What cart is this? What have you got in it? What flags are
those?”
</p>
<p>
To this the carter replied, “The cart is mine; what is in it is a
pair of wild caged lions, which the governor of Oran is sending to court
as a present to his Majesty; and the flags are our lord the King’s,
to show that what is here is his property.”
</p>
<p>
“And are the lions large?” asked Don Quixote.
</p>
<p>
“So large,” replied the man who sat at the door of the cart,
“that larger, or as large, have never crossed from Africa to Spain;
I am the keeper, and I have brought over others, but never any like these.
They are male and female; the male is in that first cage and the female in
the one behind, and they are hungry now, for they have eaten nothing
to-day, so let your worship stand aside, for we must make haste to the
place where we are to feed them.”
</p>
<p>
Hereupon, smiling slightly, Don Quixote exclaimed, “Lion-whelps to
me! to me whelps of lions, and at such a time! Then, by God! those
gentlemen who send them here shall see if I am a man to be frightened by
lions. Get down, my good fellow, and as you are the keeper open the cages,
and turn me out those beasts, and in the midst of this plain I will let
them know who Don Quixote of La Mancha is, in spite and in the teeth of
the enchanters who send them to me.”
</p>
<p>
“So, so,” said the gentleman to himself at this; “our
worthy knight has shown of what sort he is; the curds, no doubt, have
softened his skull and brought his brains to a head.”
</p>
<p>
At this instant Sancho came up to him, saying, “Señor, for God’s
sake do something to keep my master, Don Quixote, from tackling these
lions; for if he does they’ll tear us all to pieces here.”
</p>
<p>
“Is your master then so mad,” asked the gentleman, “that
you believe and are afraid he will engage such fierce animals?”
</p>
<p>
“He is not mad,” said Sancho, “but he is venturesome.”
</p>
<p>
“I will prevent it,” said the gentleman; and going over to Don
Quixote, who was insisting upon the keeper’s opening the cages, he
said to him, “Sir knight, knights-errant should attempt adventures
which encourage the hope of a successful issue, not those which entirely
withhold it; for valour that trenches upon temerity savours rather of
madness than of courage; moreover, these lions do not come to oppose you,
nor do they dream of such a thing; they are going as presents to his
Majesty, and it will not be right to stop them or delay their journey.”
</p>
<p>
“Gentle sir,” replied Don Quixote, “you go and mind your
tame partridge and your bold ferret, and leave everyone to manage his own
business; this is mine, and I know whether these gentlemen the lions come
to me or not;” and then turning to the keeper he exclaimed, “By
all that’s good, sir scoundrel, if you don’t open the cages
this very instant, I’ll pin you to the cart with this lance.”
</p>
<p>
The carter, seeing the determination of this apparition in armour, said to
him, “Please your worship, for charity’s sake, señor, let me
unyoke the mules and place myself in safety along with them before the
lions are turned out; for if they kill them on me I am ruined for life,
for all I possess is this cart and mules.”
</p>
<p>
“O man of little faith,” replied Don Quixote, “get down
and unyoke; you will soon see that you are exerting yourself for nothing,
and that you might have spared yourself the trouble.”
</p>
<p>
The carter got down and with all speed unyoked the mules, and the keeper
called out at the top of his voice, “I call all here to witness that
against my will and under compulsion I open the cages and let the lions
loose, and that I warn this gentleman that he will be accountable for all
the harm and mischief which these beasts may do, and for my salary and
dues as well. You, gentlemen, place yourselves in safety before I open,
for I know they will do me no harm.”
</p>
<p>
Once more the gentleman strove to persuade Don Quixote not to do such a
mad thing, as it was tempting God to engage in such a piece of folly. To
this, Don Quixote replied that he knew what he was about. The gentleman in
return entreated him to reflect, for he knew he was under a delusion.
</p>
<p>
“Well, señor,” answered Don Quixote, “if you do not like
to be a spectator of this tragedy, as in your opinion it will be, spur
your flea-bitten mare, and place yourself in safety.”
</p>
<p>
Hearing this, Sancho with tears in his eyes entreated him to give up an
enterprise compared with which the one of the windmills, and the awful one
of the fulling mills, and, in fact, all the feats he had attempted in the
whole course of his life, were cakes and fancy bread. “Look ye,
señor,” said Sancho, “there’s no enchantment here, nor
anything of the sort, for between the bars and chinks of the cage I have
seen the paw of a real lion, and judging by that I reckon the lion such a
paw could belong to must be bigger than a mountain.”
</p>
<p>
“Fear at any rate,” replied Don Quixote, “will make him
look bigger to thee than half the world. Retire, Sancho, and leave me; and
if I die here thou knowest our old compact; thou wilt repair to Dulcinea—I
say no more.” To these he added some further words that banished all
hope of his giving up his insane project. He of the green gaban would have
offered resistance, but he found himself ill-matched as to arms, and did
not think it prudent to come to blows with a madman, for such Don Quixote
now showed himself to be in every respect; and the latter, renewing his
commands to the keeper and repeating his threats, gave warning to the
gentleman to spur his mare, Sancho his Dapple, and the carter his mules,
all striving to get away from the cart as far as they could before the
lions broke loose. Sancho was weeping over his master’s death, for
this time he firmly believed it was in store for him from the claws of the
lions; and he cursed his fate and called it an unlucky hour when he
thought of taking service with him again; but with all his tears and
lamentations he did not forget to thrash Dapple so as to put a good space
between himself and the cart. The keeper, seeing that the fugitives were
now some distance off, once more entreated and warned him as before; but
he replied that he heard him, and that he need not trouble himself with
any further warnings or entreaties, as they would be fruitless, and bade
him make haste.
</p>
<p>
During the delay that occurred while the keeper was opening the first
cage, Don Quixote was considering whether it would not be well to do
battle on foot, instead of on horseback, and finally resolved to fight on
foot, fearing that Rocinante might take fright at the sight of the lions;
he therefore sprang off his horse, flung his lance aside, braced his
buckler on his arm, and drawing his sword, advanced slowly with marvellous
intrepidity and resolute courage, to plant himself in front of the cart,
commending himself with all his heart to God and to his lady Dulcinea.
</p>
<p>
It is to be observed, that on coming to this passage, the author of this
veracious history breaks out into exclamations. “O doughty Don
Quixote! high-mettled past extolling! Mirror, wherein all the heroes of
the world may see themselves! Second modern Don Manuel de Leon, once the
glory and honour of Spanish knighthood! In what words shall I describe
this dread exploit, by what language shall I make it credible to ages to
come, what eulogies are there unmeet for thee, though they be hyperboles
piled on hyperboles! On foot, alone, undaunted, high-souled, with but a
simple sword, and that no trenchant blade of the Perrillo brand, a shield,
but no bright polished steel one, there stoodst thou, biding and awaiting
the two fiercest lions that Africa’s forests ever bred! Thy own
deeds be thy praise, valiant Manchegan, and here I leave them as they
stand, wanting the words wherewith to glorify them!”

</p>
<p>
Here the author’s outburst came to an end, and he proceeded to take
up the thread of his story, saying that the keeper, seeing that Don
Quixote had taken up his position, and that it was impossible for him to
avoid letting out the male without incurring the enmity of the fiery and
daring knight, flung open the doors of the first cage, containing, as has
been said, the lion, which was now seen to be of enormous size, and grim
and hideous mien. The first thing he did was to turn round in the cage in
which he lay, and protrude his claws, and stretch himself thoroughly; he
next opened his mouth, and yawned very leisurely, and with near two palms’
length of tongue that he had thrust forth, he licked the dust out of his
eyes and washed his face; having done this, he put his head out of the
cage and looked all round with eyes like glowing coals, a spectacle and
demeanour to strike terror into temerity itself. Don Quixote merely
observed him steadily, longing for him to leap from the cart and come to
close quarters with him, when he hoped to hew him in pieces.
</p>
<p>
So far did his unparalleled madness go; but the noble lion, more courteous
than arrogant, not troubling himself about silly bravado, after having
looked all round, as has been said, turned about and presented his
hind-quarters to Don Quixote, and very coolly and tranquilly lay down
again in the cage. Seeing this, Don Quixote ordered the keeper to take a
stick to him and provoke him to make him come out.
</p>
<p>
“That I won’t,” said the keeper; “for if I anger
him, the first he’ll tear in pieces will be myself. Be satisfied,
sir knight, with what you have done, which leaves nothing more to be said
on the score of courage, and do not seek to tempt fortune a second time.
The lion has the door open; he is free to come out or not to come out; but
as he has not come out so far, he will not come out to-day. Your worship’s
great courage has been fully manifested already; no brave champion, so it
strikes me, is bound to do more than challenge his enemy and wait for him
on the field; if his adversary does not come, on him lies the disgrace,
and he who waits for him carries off the crown of victory.”
</p>
<p>
“That is true,” said Don Quixote; “close the door, my
friend, and let me have, in the best form thou canst, what thou hast seen
me do, by way of certificate; to wit, that thou didst open for the lion,
that I waited for him, that he did not come out, that I still waited for
him, and that still he did not come out, and lay down again. I am not
bound to do more; enchantments avaunt, and God uphold the right, the
truth, and true chivalry! Close the door as I bade thee, while I make
signals to the fugitives that have left us, that they may learn this
exploit from thy lips.”
</p>
<p>
The keeper obeyed, and Don Quixote, fixing on the point of his lance the
cloth he had wiped his face with after the deluge of curds, proceeded to
recall the others, who still continued to fly, looking back at every step,
all in a body, the gentleman bringing up the rear. Sancho, however,
happening to observe the signal of the white cloth, exclaimed, “May
I die, if my master has not overcome the wild beasts, for he is calling to
us.”
</p>
<p>
They all stopped, and perceived that it was Don Quixote who was making
signals, and shaking off their fears to some extent, they approached
slowly until they were near enough to hear distinctly Don Quixote’s
voice calling to them. They returned at length to the cart, and as they
came up, Don Quixote said to the carter, “Put your mules to once
more, brother, and continue your journey; and do thou, Sancho, give him
two gold crowns for himself and the keeper, to compensate for the delay
they have incurred through me.”
</p>
<p>
“That will I give with all my heart,” said Sancho; “but
what has become of the lions? Are they dead or alive?”
</p>
<p>
The keeper, then, in full detail, and bit by bit, described the end of the
contest, exalting to the best of his power and ability the valour of Don
Quixote, at the sight of whom the lion quailed, and would not and dared
not come out of the cage, although he had held the door open ever so long;
and showing how, in consequence of his having represented to the knight
that it was tempting God to provoke the lion in order to force him out,
which he wished to have done, he very reluctantly, and altogether against
his will, had allowed the door to be closed.
</p>
<p>
“What dost thou think of this, Sancho?” said Don Quixote.
“Are there any enchantments that can prevail against true valour?
The enchanters may be able to rob me of good fortune, but of fortitude and
courage they cannot.”
</p>
<p>
Sancho paid the crowns, the carter put to, the keeper kissed Don Quixote’s
hands for the bounty bestowed upon him, and promised to give an account of
the valiant exploit to the King himself, as soon as he saw him at court.
</p>
<p>
“Then,” said Don Quixote, “if his Majesty should happen
to ask who performed it, you must say THE KNIGHT OF THE LIONS; for it is
my desire that into this the name I have hitherto borne of Knight of the
Rueful Countenance be from this time forward changed, altered,
transformed, and turned; and in this I follow the ancient usage of
knights-errant, who changed their names when they pleased, or when it
suited their purpose.”
</p>
<p>
The cart went its way, and Don Quixote, Sancho, and he of the green gaban
went theirs. All this time, Don Diego de Miranda had not spoken a word,
being entirely taken up with observing and noting all that Don Quixote did
and said, and the opinion he formed was that he was a man of brains gone
mad, and a madman on the verge of rationality. The first part of his
history had not yet reached him, for, had he read it, the amazement with
which his words and deeds filled him would have vanished, as he would then
have understood the nature of his madness; but knowing nothing of it, he
took him to be rational one moment, and crazy the next, for what he said
was sensible, elegant, and well expressed, and what he did, absurd, rash,
and foolish; and said he to himself, “What could be madder than
putting on a helmet full of curds, and then persuading oneself that
enchanters are softening one’s skull; or what could be greater
rashness and folly than wanting to fight lions tooth and nail?”
</p>
<p>
Don Quixote roused him from these reflections and this soliloquy by
saying, “No doubt, Señor Don Diego de Miranda, you set me down in
your mind as a fool and a madman, and it would be no wonder if you did,
for my deeds do not argue anything else. But for all that, I would have
you take notice that I am neither so mad nor so foolish as I must have
seemed to you. A gallant knight shows to advantage bringing his lance to
bear adroitly upon a fierce bull under the eyes of his sovereign, in the
midst of a spacious plaza; a knight shows to advantage arrayed in
glittering armour, pacing the lists before the ladies in some joyous
tournament, and all those knights show to advantage that entertain,
divert, and, if we may say so, honour the courts of their princes by
warlike exercises, or what resemble them; but to greater advantage than
all these does a knight-errant show when he traverses deserts, solitudes,
cross-roads, forests, and mountains, in quest of perilous adventures, bent
on bringing them to a happy and successful issue, all to win a glorious
and lasting renown. To greater advantage, I maintain, does the
knight-errant show bringing aid to some widow in some lonely waste, than
the court knight dallying with some city damsel. All knights have their
own special parts to play; let the courtier devote himself to the ladies,
let him add lustre to his sovereign’s court by his liveries, let him
entertain poor gentlemen with the sumptuous fare of his table, let him
arrange joustings, marshal tournaments, and prove himself noble, generous,
and magnificent, and above all a good Christian, and so doing he will
fulfil the duties that are especially his; but let the knight-errant
explore the corners of the earth and penetrate the most intricate
labyrinths, at each step let him attempt impossibilities, on desolate
heaths let him endure the burning rays of the midsummer sun, and the
bitter inclemency of the winter winds and frosts; let no lions daunt him,
no monsters terrify him, no dragons make him quail; for to seek these, to
attack those, and to vanquish all, are in truth his main duties. I, then,
as it has fallen to my lot to be a member of knight-errantry, cannot avoid
attempting all that to me seems to come within the sphere of my duties;
thus it was my bounden duty to attack those lions that I just now
attacked, although I knew it to be the height of rashness; for I know well
what valour is, that it is a virtue that occupies a place between two
vicious extremes, cowardice and temerity; but it will be a lesser evil for
him who is valiant to rise till he reaches the point of rashness, than to
sink until he reaches the point of cowardice; for, as it is easier for the
prodigal than for the miser to become generous, so it is easier for a rash
man to prove truly valiant than for a coward to rise to true valour; and
believe me, Señor Don Diego, in attempting adventures it is better to lose
by a card too many than by a card too few; for to hear it said, ‘such
a knight is rash and daring,’ sounds better than ‘such a
knight is timid and cowardly.’”
</p>
<p>
“I protest, Señor Don Quixote,” said Don Diego, “everything
you have said and done is proved correct by the test of reason itself; and
I believe, if the laws and ordinances of knight-errantry should be lost,
they might be found in your worship’s breast as in their own proper
depository and muniment-house; but let us make haste, and reach my
village, where you shall take rest after your late exertions; for if they
have not been of the body they have been of the spirit, and these
sometimes tend to produce bodily fatigue.”
</p>
<p>
“I take the invitation as a great favour and honour, Señor Don
Diego,” replied Don Quixote; and pressing forward at a better pace
than before, at about two in the afternoon they reached the village and
house of Don Diego, or, as Don Quixote called him, “The Knight of
the Green Gaban.”

Don Quixote found Don Diego de Miranda’s house built in village
style, with his arms in rough stone over the street door; in the patio was
the store-room, and at the entrance the cellar, with plenty of wine-jars
standing round, which, coming from El Toboso, brought back to his memory
his enchanted and transformed Dulcinea; and with a sigh, and not thinking
of what he was saying, or in whose presence he was, he exclaimed-
</p>
<p class="poem">
“O ye sweet treasures, to my sorrow found!<br>
Once sweet and welcome when ’twas heaven’s good-will.<br>
<br>
“O ye Tobosan jars, how ye bring back to my memory the<br>
sweet object of my bitter regrets!”

</p>
<p>
The student poet, Don Diego’s son, who had come out with his mother
to receive him, heard this exclamation, and both mother and son were
filled with amazement at the extraordinary figure he presented; he,
however, dismounting from Rocinante, advanced with great politeness to ask
permission to kiss the lady’s hand, while Don Diego said, “Señora,
pray receive with your wonted kindness Señor Don Quixote of La Mancha,
whom you see before you, a knight-errant, and the bravest and wisest in
the world.”
</p>
<p>
The lady, whose name was Doña Christina, received him with every sign of
good-will and great courtesy, and Don Quixote placed himself at her
service with an abundance of well-chosen and polished phrases. Almost the
same civilities were exchanged between him and the student, who listening
to Don Quixote, took him to be a sensible, clear-headed person.
</p>
<p>
Here the author describes minutely everything belonging to Don Diego’s
mansion, putting before us in his picture the whole contents of a rich
gentleman-farmer’s house; but the translator of the history thought
it best to pass over these and other details of the same sort in silence,
as they are not in harmony with the main purpose of the story, the strong
point of which is truth rather than dull digressions.
</p>
<p>
They led Don Quixote into a room, and Sancho removed his armour, leaving
him in loose Walloon breeches and chamois-leather doublet, all stained
with the rust of his armour; his collar was a falling one of scholastic
cut, without starch or lace, his buskins buff-coloured, and his shoes
polished. He wore his good sword, which hung in a baldric of sea-wolf’s
skin, for he had suffered for many years, they say, from an ailment of the
kidneys; and over all he threw a long cloak of good grey cloth. But first
of all, with five or six buckets of water (for as regard the number of
buckets there is some dispute), he washed his head and face, and still the
water remained whey-coloured, thanks to Sancho’s greediness and
purchase of those unlucky curds that turned his master so white. Thus
arrayed, and with an easy, sprightly, and gallant air, Don Quixote passed
out into another room, where the student was waiting to entertain him
while the table was being laid; for on the arrival of so distinguished a
guest, Doña Christina was anxious to show that she knew how and was able
to give a becoming reception to those who came to her house.
</p>
<p>
While Don Quixote was taking off his armour, Don Lorenzo (for so Don Diego’s
son was called) took the opportunity to say to his father, “What are
we to make of this gentleman you have brought home to us, sir? For his
name, his appearance, and your describing him as a knight-errant have
completely puzzled my mother and me.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know what to say, my son,” replied. Don Diego;
“all I can tell thee is that I have seen him act the acts of the
greatest madman in the world, and heard him make observations so sensible
that they efface and undo all he does; do thou talk to him and feel the
pulse of his wits, and as thou art shrewd, form the most reasonable
conclusion thou canst as to his wisdom or folly; though, to tell the
truth, I am more inclined to take him to be mad than sane.”
</p>
<p>
With this Don Lorenzo went away to entertain Don Quixote as has been said,
and in the course of the conversation that passed between them Don Quixote
said to Don Lorenzo, “Your father, Señor Don Diego de Miranda, has
told me of the rare abilities and subtle intellect you possess, and, above
all, that you are a great poet.”
</p>
<p>
“A poet, it may be,” replied Don Lorenzo, “but a great
one, by no means. It is true that I am somewhat given to poetry and to
reading good poets, but not so much so as to justify the title of ‘great’
which my father gives me.”
</p>
<p>
“I do not dislike that modesty,” said Don Quixote; “for
there is no poet who is not conceited and does not think he is the best
poet in the world.”
</p>
<p>
“There is no rule without an exception,” said Don Lorenzo;
“there may be some who are poets and yet do not think they are.”
</p>
<p>
“Very few,” said Don Quixote; “but tell me, what verses
are those which you have now in hand, and which your father tells me keep
you somewhat restless and absorbed? If it be some gloss, I know something
about glosses, and I should like to hear them; and if they are for a
poetical tournament, contrive to carry off the second prize; for the first
always goes by favour or personal standing, the second by simple justice;
and so the third comes to be the second, and the first, reckoning in this
way, will be third, in the same way as licentiate degrees are conferred at
the universities; but, for all that, the title of first is a great
distinction.”
</p>
<p>
“So far,” said Don Lorenzo to himself, “I should not
take you to be a madman; but let us go on.” So he said to him,
“Your worship has apparently attended the schools; what sciences
have you studied?”
</p>
<p>
“That of knight-errantry,” said Don Quixote, “which is
as good as that of poetry, and even a finger or two above it.”
</p>
<p>
“I do not know what science that is,” said Don Lorenzo,
“and until now I have never heard of it.”
</p>
<p>
“It is a science,” said Don Quixote, “that comprehends
in itself all or most of the sciences in the world, for he who professes
it must be a jurist, and must know the rules of justice, distributive and
equitable, so as to give to each one what belongs to him and is due to
him. He must be a theologian, so as to be able to give a clear and
distinctive reason for the Christian faith he professes, wherever it may
be asked of him. He must be a physician, and above all a herbalist, so as
in wastes and solitudes to know the herbs that have the property of
healing wounds, for a knight-errant must not go looking for someone to
cure him at every step. He must be an astronomer, so as to know by the
stars how many hours of the night have passed, and what clime and quarter
of the world he is in. He must know mathematics, for at every turn some
occasion for them will present itself to him; and, putting it aside that
he must be adorned with all the virtues, cardinal and theological, to come
down to minor particulars, he must, I say, be able to swim as well as
Nicholas or Nicolao the Fish could, as the story goes; he must know how to
shoe a horse, and repair his saddle and bridle; and, to return to higher
matters, he must be faithful to God and to his lady; he must be pure in
thought, decorous in words, generous in works, valiant in deeds, patient
in suffering, compassionate towards the needy, and, lastly, an upholder of
the truth though its defence should cost him his life. Of all these
qualities, great and small, is a true knight-errant made up; judge then,
Señor Don Lorenzo, whether it be a contemptible science which the knight
who studies and professes it has to learn, and whether it may not compare
with the very loftiest that are taught in the schools.”
</p>
<p>
“If that be so,” replied Don Lorenzo, “this science, I
protest, surpasses all.”
</p>
<p>
“How, if that be so?” said Don Quixote.
</p>
<p>
“What I mean to say,” said Don Lorenzo, “is, that I
doubt whether there are now, or ever were, any knights-errant, and adorned
with such virtues.”
</p>
<p>
“Many a time,” replied Don Quixote, “have I said what I
now say once more, that the majority of the world are of opinion that
there never were any knights-errant in it; and as it is my opinion that,
unless heaven by some miracle brings home to them the truth that there
were and are, all the pains one takes will be in vain (as experience has
often proved to me), I will not now stop to disabuse you of the error you
share with the multitude. All I shall do is to pray to heaven to deliver
you from it, and show you how beneficial and necessary knights-errant were
in days of yore, and how useful they would be in these days were they but
in vogue; but now, for the sins of the people, sloth and indolence,
gluttony and luxury are triumphant.”
</p>
<p>
“Our guest has broken out on our hands,” said Don Lorenzo to
himself at this point; “but, for all that, he is a glorious madman,
and I should be a dull blockhead to doubt it.”
</p>
<p>
Here, being summoned to dinner, they brought their colloquy to a close.
Don Diego asked his son what he had been able to make out as to the wits
of their guest. To which he replied, “All the doctors and clever
scribes in the world will not make sense of the scrawl of his madness; he
is a madman full of streaks, full of lucid intervals.”
</p>
<p>
They went in to dinner, and the repast was such as Don Diego said on the
road he was in the habit of giving to his guests, neat, plentiful, and
tasty; but what pleased Don Quixote most was the marvellous silence that
reigned throughout the house, for it was like a Carthusian monastery.
</p>
<p>
When the cloth had been removed, grace said and their hands washed, Don
Quixote earnestly pressed Don Lorenzo to repeat to him his verses for the
poetical tournament, to which he replied, “Not to be like those
poets who, when they are asked to recite their verses, refuse, and when
they are not asked for them vomit them up, I will repeat my gloss, for
which I do not expect any prize, having composed it merely as an exercise
of ingenuity.”
</p>
<p>
“A discerning friend of mine,” said Don Quixote, “was of
opinion that no one ought to waste labour in glossing verses; and the
reason he gave was that the gloss can never come up to the text, and that
often or most frequently it wanders away from the meaning and purpose
aimed at in the glossed lines; and besides, that the laws of the gloss
were too strict, as they did not allow interrogations, nor ‘said he,’
nor ‘I say,’ nor turning verbs into nouns, or altering the
construction, not to speak of other restrictions and limitations that
fetter gloss-writers, as you no doubt know.”
</p>
<p>
“Verily, Señor Don Quixote,” said Don Lorenzo, “I wish I
could catch your worship tripping at a stretch, but I cannot, for you slip
through my fingers like an eel.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t understand what you say, or mean by slipping,”
said Don Quixote.
</p>
<p>
“I will explain myself another time,” said Don Lorenzo;
“for the present pray attend to the glossed verses and the gloss,
which run thus:
</p>
<p class="poem">
Could ‘was’ become an ‘is’ for me,<br>
Then would I ask no more than this;<br>
Or could, for me, the time that is<br>
Become the time that is to be!—<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
GLOSS<br>
<br>
Dame Fortune once upon a day<br>
To me was bountiful and kind;<br>
But all things change; she changed her mind,<br>
And what she gave she took away.<br>
O Fortune, long I’ve sued to thee;<br>
The gifts thou gavest me restore,<br>
For, trust me, I would ask no more,<br>
Could ‘was’ become an ‘is’ for me.<br>
<br>
No other prize I seek to gain,<br>
No triumph, glory, or success,<br>
Only the long-lost happiness,<br>
The memory whereof is pain.<br>
One taste, methinks, of bygone bliss<br>
The heart-consuming fire might stay;<br>
And, so it come without delay,<br>
Then would I ask no more than this.<br>
<br>
I ask what cannot be, alas!<br>
That time should ever be, and then<br>
Come back to us, and be again,<br>
No power on earth can bring to pass;<br>
For fleet of foot is he, I wis,<br>
And idly, therefore, do we pray<br>
That what for aye hath left us may<br>
Become for us the time that is.<br>
<br>
Perplexed, uncertain, to remain<br>
’Twixt hope and fear, is death, not life;<br>
’Twere better, sure, to end the strife,<br>
And dying, seek release from pain.<br>
And yet, thought were the best for me.<br>
Anon the thought aside I fling,<br>
And to the present fondly cling,<br>
And dread the time that is to be.”<br>
</p>
<p>
When Don Lorenzo had finished reciting his gloss, Don Quixote stood up,
and in a loud voice, almost a shout, exclaimed as he grasped Don Lorenzo’s
right hand in his, “By the highest heavens, noble youth, but you are
the best poet on earth, and deserve to be crowned with laurel, not by
Cyprus or by Gaeta—as a certain poet, God forgive him, said—but
by the Academies of Athens, if they still flourished, and by those that
flourish now, Paris, Bologna, Salamanca. Heaven grant that the judges who
rob you of the first prize—that Phœbus may pierce them with his
arrows, and the Muses never cross the thresholds of their doors. Repeat me
some of your long-measure verses, señor, if you will be so good, for I
want thoroughly to feel the pulse of your rare genius.”
</p>
<p>
Is there any need to say that Don Lorenzo enjoyed hearing himself praised
by Don Quixote, albeit he looked upon him as a madman? power of flattery,
how far-reaching art thou, and how wide are the bounds of thy pleasant
jurisdiction! Don Lorenzo gave a proof of it, for he complied with Don
Quixote’s request and entreaty, and repeated to him this sonnet on
the fable or story of Pyramus and Thisbe.
</p>
<p class="poem">
SONNET<br>
<br>
The lovely maid, she pierces now the wall;<br>
Heart-pierced by her young Pyramus doth lie;<br>
And Love spreads wing from Cyprus isle to fly,<br>
A chink to view so wondrous great and small.<br>
There silence speaketh, for no voice at all<br>
Can pass so strait a strait; but love will ply<br>
Where to all other power ’twere vain to try;<br>
For love will find a way whate’er befall.<br>
Impatient of delay, with reckless pace<br>
The rash maid wins the fatal spot where she<br>
Sinks not in lover’s arms but death’s embrace.<br>
So runs the strange tale, how the lovers twain<br>
One sword, one sepulchre, one memory,<br>
Slays, and entombs, and brings to life again.<br>
</p>
<p>
“Blessed be God,” said Don Quixote when he had heard Don
Lorenzo’s sonnet, “that among the hosts there are of irritable
poets I have found one consummate one, which, señor, the art of this
sonnet proves to me that you are!”
</p>
<p>
For four days was Don Quixote most sumptuously entertained in Don Diego’s
house, at the end of which time he asked his permission to depart, telling
him he thanked him for the kindness and hospitality he had received in his
house, but that, as it did not become knights-errant to give themselves up
for long to idleness and luxury, he was anxious to fulfill the duties of
his calling in seeking adventures, of which he was informed there was an
abundance in that neighbourhood, where he hoped to employ his time until
the day came round for the jousts at Saragossa, for that was his proper
destination; and that, first of all, he meant to enter the cave of
Montesinos, of which so many marvellous things were reported all through
the country, and at the same time to investigate and explore the origin
and true source of the seven lakes commonly called the lakes of Ruidera.
</p>
<p>
Don Diego and his son commended his laudable resolution, and bade him
furnish himself with all he wanted from their house and belongings, as
they would most gladly be of service to him; which, indeed, his personal
worth and his honourable profession made incumbent upon them.
</p>
<p>
The day of his departure came at length, as welcome to Don Quixote as it
was sad and sorrowful to Sancho Panza, who was very well satisfied with
the abundance of Don Diego’s house, and objected to return to the
starvation of the woods and wilds and the short-commons of his ill-stocked
alforjas; these, however, he filled and packed with what he considered
needful. On taking leave, Don Quixote said to Don Lorenzo, “I know
not whether I have told you already, but if I have I tell you once more,
that if you wish to spare yourself fatigue and toil in reaching the
inaccessible summit of the temple of fame, you have nothing to do but to
turn aside out of the somewhat narrow path of poetry and take the still
narrower one of knight-errantry, wide enough, however, to make you an
emperor in the twinkling of an eye.”
</p>
<p>
In this speech Don Quixote wound up the evidence of his madness, but still
better in what he added when he said, “God knows, I would gladly
take Don Lorenzo with me to teach him how to spare the humble, and trample
the proud under foot, virtues that are part and parcel of the profession I
belong to; but since his tender age does not allow of it, nor his
praiseworthy pursuits permit it, I will simply content myself with
impressing it upon your worship that you will become famous as a poet if
you are guided by the opinion of others rather than by your own; because
no fathers or mothers ever think their own children ill-favoured, and this
sort of deception prevails still more strongly in the case of the children
of the brain.”
</p>
<p>
Both father and son were amazed afresh at the strange medley Don Quixote
talked, at one moment sense, at another nonsense, and at the pertinacity
and persistence he displayed in going through thick and thin in quest of
his unlucky adventures, which he made the end and aim of his desires.
There was a renewal of offers of service and civilities, and then, with
the gracious permission of the lady of the castle, they took their
departure, Don Quixote on Rocinante, and Sancho on Dapple.

<p>
Don Quixote had gone but a short distance beyond Don Diego’s
village, when he fell in with a couple of either priests or students, and
a couple of peasants, mounted on four beasts of the ass kind. One of the
students carried, wrapped up in a piece of green buckram by way of a
portmanteau, what seemed to be a little linen and a couple of pairs of
ribbed stockings; the other carried nothing but a pair of new
fencing-foils with buttons. The peasants carried divers articles that
showed they were on their way from some large town where they had bought
them, and were taking them home to their village; and both students and
peasants were struck with the same amazement that everybody felt who saw
Don Quixote for the first time, and were dying to know who this man, so
different from ordinary men, could be. Don Quixote saluted them, and after
ascertaining that their road was the same as his, made them an offer of
his company, and begged them to slacken their pace, as their young asses
travelled faster than his horse; and then, to gratify them, he told them
in a few words who he was and the calling and profession he followed,
which was that of a knight-errant seeking adventures in all parts of the
world. He informed them that his own name was Don Quixote of La Mancha,
and that he was called, by way of surname, the Knight of the Lions.
</p>
<p>
All this was Greek or gibberish to the peasants, but not so to the
students, who very soon perceived the crack in Don Quixote’s pate;
for all that, however, they regarded him with admiration and respect, and
one of them said to him, “If you, sir knight, have no fixed road, as
it is the way with those who seek adventures not to have any, let your
worship come with us; you will see one of the finest and richest weddings
that up to this day have ever been celebrated in La Mancha, or for many a
league round.”
</p>
<p>
Don Quixote asked him if it was some prince’s, that he spoke of it in
this way. “Not at all,” said the student; “it is the wedding
of a farmer and a farmer’s daughter, he the richest in all this country,
and she the fairest mortal ever set eyes on. The display with which it is to be
attended will be something rare and out of the common, for it will be
celebrated in a meadow adjoining the town of the bride, who is called, <i>par
excellence</i>, Quiteria the fair, as the bridegroom is called Camacho the
rich. She is eighteen, and he twenty-two, and they are fairly matched, though
some knowing ones, who have all the pedigrees in the world by heart, will have
it that the family of the fair Quiteria is better than Camacho’s; but no
one minds that now-a-days, for wealth can solder a great many flaws. At any
rate, Camacho is free-handed, and it is his fancy to screen the whole meadow
with boughs and cover it in overhead, so that the sun will have hard work if he
tries to get in to reach the grass that covers the soil. He has provided
dancers too, not only sword but also bell-dancers, for in his own town there
are those who ring the changes and jingle the bells to perfection; of
shoe-dancers I say nothing, for of them he has engaged a host. But none of
these things, nor of the many others I have omitted to mention, will do more to
make this a memorable wedding than the part which I suspect the despairing
Basilio will play in it. This Basilio is a youth of the same village as
Quiteria, and he lived in the house next door to that of her parents, of which
circumstance Love took advantage to reproduce to the word the long-forgotten
loves of Pyramus and Thisbe; for Basilio loved Quiteria from his earliest
years, and she responded to his passion with countless modest proofs of
affection, so that the loves of the two children, Basilio and Quiteria, were
the talk and the amusement of the town. As they grew up, the father of Quiteria
made up his mind to refuse Basilio his wonted freedom of access to the house,
and to relieve himself of constant doubts and suspicions, he arranged a match
for his daughter with the rich Camacho, as he did not approve of marrying her
to Basilio, who had not so large a share of the gifts of fortune as of nature;
for if the truth be told ungrudgingly, he is the most agile youth we know, a
mighty thrower of the bar, a first-rate wrestler, and a great ball-player; he
runs like a deer, and leaps better than a goat, bowls over the nine-pins as if
by magic, sings like a lark, plays the guitar so as to make it speak, and,
above all, handles a sword as well as the best.”
</p>
<p>
“For that excellence alone,” said Don Quixote at this, “the
youth deserves to marry, not merely the fair Quiteria, but Queen Guinevere
herself, were she alive now, in spite of Launcelot and all who would try
to prevent it.”
</p>
<p>
“Say that to my wife,” said Sancho, who had until now listened
in silence, “for she won’t hear of anything but each one
marrying his equal, holding with the proverb ‘each ewe to her like.’
What I would like is that this good Basilio (for I am beginning to take a
fancy to him already) should marry this lady Quiteria; and a blessing and
good luck—I meant to say the opposite—on people who would
prevent those who love one another from marrying.”
</p>
<p>
“If all those who love one another were to marry,” said Don
Quixote, “it would deprive parents of the right to choose, and marry
their children to the proper person and at the proper time; and if it was
left to daughters to choose husbands as they pleased, one would be for
choosing her father’s servant, and another, someone she has seen
passing in the street and fancies gallant and dashing, though he may be a
drunken bully; for love and fancy easily blind the eyes of the judgment,
so much wanted in choosing one’s way of life; and the matrimonial
choice is very liable to error, and it needs great caution and the special
favour of heaven to make it a good one. He who has to make a long journey,
will, if he is wise, look out for some trusty and pleasant companion to
accompany him before he sets out. Why, then, should not he do the same who
has to make the whole journey of life down to the final halting-place of
death, more especially when the companion has to be his companion in bed,
at board, and everywhere, as the wife is to her husband? The companionship
of one’s wife is no article of merchandise, that, after it has been
bought, may be returned, or bartered, or changed; for it is an inseparable
accident that lasts as long as life lasts; it is a noose that, once you
put it round your neck, turns into a Gordian knot, which, if the scythe of
Death does not cut it, there is no untying. I could say a great deal more
on this subject, were I not prevented by the anxiety I feel to know if the
señor licentiate has anything more to tell about the story of Basilio.”
</p>
<p>
To this the student, bachelor, or, as Don Quixote called him, licentiate,
replied, “I have nothing whatever to say further, but that from the
moment Basilio learned that the fair Quiteria was to be married to Camacho
the rich, he has never been seen to smile, or heard to utter rational
word, and he always goes about moody and dejected, talking to himself in a
way that shows plainly he is out of his senses. He eats little and sleeps
little, and all he eats is fruit, and when he sleeps, if he sleeps at all,
it is in the field on the hard earth like a brute beast. Sometimes he
gazes at the sky, at other times he fixes his eyes on the earth in such an
abstracted way that he might be taken for a clothed statue, with its
drapery stirred by the wind. In short, he shows such signs of a heart
crushed by suffering, that all we who know him believe that when to-morrow
the fair Quiteria says ‘yes,’ it will be his sentence of
death.”
</p>
<p>
“God will guide it better,” said Sancho, “for God who
gives the wound gives the salve; nobody knows what will happen; there are
a good many hours between this and to-morrow, and any one of them, or any
moment, the house may fall; I have seen the rain coming down and the sun
shining all at one time; many a one goes to bed in good health who can’t
stir the next day. And tell me, is there anyone who can boast of having
driven a nail into the wheel of fortune? No, faith; and between a woman’s
‘yes’ and ‘no’ I wouldn’t venture to put the
point of a pin, for there would not be room for it; if you tell me
Quiteria loves Basilio heart and soul, then I’ll give him a bag of
good luck; for love, I have heard say, looks through spectacles that make
copper seem gold, poverty wealth, and bleary eyes pearls.”
</p>
<p>
“What art thou driving at, Sancho? curses on thee!” said Don
Quixote; “for when thou takest to stringing proverbs and sayings
together, no one can understand thee but Judas himself, and I wish he had
thee. Tell me, thou animal, what dost thou know about nails or wheels, or
anything else?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, if you don’t understand me,” replied Sancho,
“it is no wonder my words are taken for nonsense; but no matter; I
understand myself, and I know I have not said anything very foolish in
what I have said; only your worship, señor, is always gravelling at
everything I say, nay, everything I do.”
</p>
<p>
“Cavilling, not gravelling,” said Don Quixote, “thou
prevaricator of honest language, God confound thee!”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t find fault with me, your worship,” returned
Sancho, “for you know I have not been bred up at court or trained at
Salamanca, to know whether I am adding or dropping a letter or so in my
words. Why! God bless me, it’s not fair to force a Sayago-man to
speak like a Toledan; maybe there are Toledans who do not hit it off when
it comes to polished talk.”
</p>
<p>
“That is true,” said the licentiate, “for those who have
been bred up in the Tanneries and the Zocodover cannot talk like those who
are almost all day pacing the cathedral cloisters, and yet they are all
Toledans. Pure, correct, elegant and lucid language will be met with in
men of courtly breeding and discrimination, though they may have been born
in Majalahonda; I say of discrimination, because there are many who are
not so, and discrimination is the grammar of good language, if it be
accompanied by practice. I, sirs, for my sins have studied canon law at
Salamanca, and I rather pique myself on expressing my meaning in clear,
plain, and intelligible language.”
</p>
<p>
“If you did not pique yourself more on your dexterity with those
foils you carry than on dexterity of tongue,” said the other
student, “you would have been head of the degrees, where you are now
tail.”
</p>
<p>
“Look here, bachelor Corchuelo,” returned the licentiate,
“you have the most mistaken idea in the world about skill with the
sword, if you think it useless.”
</p>
<p>
“It is no idea on my part, but an established truth,” replied
Corchuelo; “and if you wish me to prove it to you by experiment, you
have swords there, and it is a good opportunity; I have a steady hand and
a strong arm, and these joined with my resolution, which is not small,
will make you confess that I am not mistaken. Dismount and put in practice
your positions and circles and angles and science, for I hope to make you
see stars at noonday with my rude raw swordsmanship, in which, next to
God, I place my trust that the man is yet to be born who will make me turn
my back, and that there is not one in the world I will not compel to give
ground.”
</p>
<p>
“As to whether you turn your back or not, I do not concern myself,”
replied the master of fence; “though it might be that your grave
would be dug on the spot where you planted your foot the first time; I
mean that you would be stretched dead there for despising skill with the
sword.”
</p>
<p>
“We shall soon see,” replied Corchuelo, and getting off his
ass briskly, he drew out furiously one of the swords the licentiate
carried on his beast.
</p>
<p>
“It must not be that way,” said Don Quixote at this point;
“I will be the director of this fencing match, and judge of this
often disputed question;” and dismounting from Rocinante and
grasping his lance, he planted himself in the middle of the road, just as
the licentiate, with an easy, graceful bearing and step, advanced towards
Corchuelo, who came on against him, darting fire from his eyes, as the
saying is. The other two of the company, the peasants, without dismounting
from their asses, served as spectators of the mortal tragedy. The cuts,
thrusts, down strokes, back strokes and doubles, that Corchuelo delivered
were past counting, and came thicker than hops or hail. He attacked like
an angry lion, but he was met by a tap on the mouth from the button of the
licentiate’s sword that checked him in the midst of his furious
onset, and made him kiss it as if it were a relic, though not as devoutly
as relics are and ought to be kissed. The end of it was that the
licentiate reckoned up for him by thrusts every one of the buttons of the
short cassock he wore, tore the skirts into strips, like the tails of a
cuttlefish, knocked off his hat twice, and so completely tired him out,
that in vexation, anger, and rage, he took the sword by the hilt and flung
it away with such force, that one of the peasants that were there, who was
a notary, and who went for it, made an affidavit afterwards that he sent
it nearly three-quarters of a league, which testimony will serve, and has
served, to show and establish with all certainty that strength is overcome
by skill.
</p>
<p>
Corchuelo sat down wearied, and Sancho approaching him said, “By my
faith, señor bachelor, if your worship takes my advice, you will never
challenge anyone to fence again, only to wrestle and throw the bar, for
you have the youth and strength for that; but as for these fencers as they
call them, I have heard say they can put the point of a sword through the
eye of a needle.”
</p>
<p>
“I am satisfied with having tumbled off my donkey,” said
Corchuelo, “and with having had the truth I was so ignorant of
proved to me by experience;” and getting up he embraced the
licentiate, and they were better friends than ever; and not caring to wait
for the notary who had gone for the sword, as they saw he would be a long
time about it, they resolved to push on so as to reach the village of
Quiteria, to which they all belonged, in good time.
</p>
<p>
During the remainder of the journey the licentiate held forth to them on
the excellences of the sword, with such conclusive arguments, and such
figures and mathematical proofs, that all were convinced of the value of
the science, and Corchuelo cured of his dogmatism.
</p>
<p>
It grew dark; but before they reached the town it seemed to them all as if
there was a heaven full of countless glittering stars in front of it. They
heard, too, the pleasant mingled notes of a variety of instruments,
flutes, drums, psalteries, pipes, tabors, and timbrels, and as they drew
near they perceived that the trees of a leafy arcade that had been
constructed at the entrance of the town were filled with lights unaffected
by the wind, for the breeze at the time was so gentle that it had not
power to stir the leaves on the trees. The musicians were the life of the
wedding, wandering through the pleasant grounds in separate bands, some
dancing, others singing, others playing the various instruments already
mentioned. In short, it seemed as though mirth and gaiety were frisking
and gambolling all over the meadow. Several other persons were engaged in
erecting raised benches from which people might conveniently see the plays
and dances that were to be performed the next day on the spot dedicated to
the celebration of the marriage of Camacho the rich and the obsequies of
Basilio. Don Quixote would not enter the village, although the peasant as
well as the bachelor pressed him; he excused himself, however, on the
grounds, amply sufficient in his opinion, that it was the custom of
knights-errant to sleep in the fields and woods in preference to towns,
even were it under gilded ceilings; and so turned aside a little out of
the road, very much against Sancho’s will, as the good quarters he
had enjoyed in the castle or house of Don Diego came back to his mind.

Scarce had the fair Aurora given bright Phœbus time to dry the liquid
pearls upon her golden locks with the heat of his fervent rays, when Don
Quixote, shaking off sloth from his limbs, sprang to his feet and called
to his squire Sancho, who was still snoring; seeing which Don Quixote ere
he roused him thus addressed him: “Happy thou, above all the
dwellers on the face of the earth, that, without envying or being envied,
sleepest with tranquil mind, and that neither enchanters persecute nor
enchantments affright. Sleep, I say, and will say a hundred times, without
any jealous thoughts of thy mistress to make thee keep ceaseless vigils,
or any cares as to how thou art to pay the debts thou owest, or find
to-morrow’s food for thyself and thy needy little family, to
interfere with thy repose. Ambition breaks not thy rest, nor doth this
world’s empty pomp disturb thee, for the utmost reach of thy anxiety
is to provide for thy ass, since upon my shoulders thou hast laid the
support of thyself, the counterpoise and burden that nature and custom
have imposed upon masters. The servant sleeps and the master lies awake
thinking how he is to feed him, advance him, and reward him. The distress
of seeing the sky turn brazen, and withhold its needful moisture from the
earth, is not felt by the servant but by the master, who in time of
scarcity and famine must support him who has served him in times of plenty
and abundance.”

To all this Sancho made no reply because he was asleep, nor would he have
wakened up so soon as he did had not Don Quixote brought him to his senses
with the butt of his lance. He awoke at last, drowsy and lazy, and casting
his eyes about in every direction, observed, “There comes, if I don’t
mistake, from the quarter of that arcade a steam and a smell a great deal
more like fried rashers than galingale or thyme; a wedding that begins
with smells like that, by my faith, ought to be plentiful and unstinting.”
</p>
<p>
“Have done, thou glutton,” said Don Quixote; “come, let
us go and witness this bridal, and see what the rejected Basilio does.”
</p>
<p>
“Let him do what he likes,” returned Sancho; “be he not
poor, he would marry Quiteria. To make a grand match for himself, and he
without a farthing; is there nothing else? Faith, señor, it’s my
opinion the poor man should be content with what he can get, and not go
looking for dainties in the bottom of the sea. I will bet my arm that
Camacho could bury Basilio in reals; and if that be so, as no doubt it is,
what a fool Quiteria would be to refuse the fine dresses and jewels
Camacho must have given her and will give her, and take Basilio’s
bar-throwing and sword-play. They won’t give a pint of wine at the
tavern for a good cast of the bar or a neat thrust of the sword. Talents
and accomplishments that can’t be turned into money, let Count
Dirlos have them; but when such gifts fall to one that has hard cash, I
wish my condition of life was as becoming as they are. On a good
foundation you can raise a good building, and the best foundation in the
world is money.”
</p>
<p>
“For God’s sake, Sancho,” said Don Quixote here, “stop
that harangue; it is my belief, if thou wert allowed to continue all thou
beginnest every instant, thou wouldst have no time left for eating or
sleeping; for thou wouldst spend it all in talking.”
</p>
<p>
“If your worship had a good memory,” replied Sancho, “you
would remember the articles of our agreement before we started from home
this last time; one of them was that I was to be let say all I liked, so
long as it was not against my neighbour or your worship’s authority;
and so far, it seems to me, I have not broken the said article.”
</p>
<p>
“I remember no such article, Sancho,” said Don Quixote;
“and even if it were so, I desire you to hold your tongue and come
along; for the instruments we heard last night are already beginning to
enliven the valleys again, and no doubt the marriage will take place in
the cool of the morning, and not in the heat of the afternoon.”
</p>
<p>
Sancho did as his master bade him, and putting the saddle on Rocinante and
the pack-saddle on Dapple, they both mounted and at a leisurely pace
entered the arcade. The first thing that presented itself to Sancho’s
eyes was a whole ox spitted on a whole elm tree, and in the fire at which
it was to be roasted there was burning a middling-sized mountain of
faggots, and six stewpots that stood round the blaze had not been made in
the ordinary mould of common pots, for they were six half wine-jars, each
fit to hold the contents of a slaughter-house; they swallowed up whole
sheep and hid them away in their insides without showing any more sign of
them than if they were pigeons. Countless were the hares ready skinned and
the plucked fowls that hung on the trees for burial in the pots,
numberless the wildfowl and game of various sorts suspended from the
branches that the air might keep them cool. Sancho counted more than sixty
wine skins of over six gallons each, and all filled, as it proved
afterwards, with generous wines. There were, besides, piles of the whitest
bread, like the heaps of corn one sees on the threshing-floors. There was
a wall made of cheeses arranged like open brick-work, and two cauldrons
full of oil, bigger than those of a dyer’s shop, served for cooking
fritters, which when fried were taken out with two mighty shovels, and
plunged into another cauldron of prepared honey that stood close by. Of
cooks and cook-maids there were over fifty, all clean, brisk, and blithe.
In the capacious belly of the ox were a dozen soft little sucking-pigs,
which, sewn up there, served to give it tenderness and flavour. The spices
of different kinds did not seem to have been bought by the pound but by
the quarter, and all lay open to view in a great chest. In short, all the
preparations made for the wedding were in rustic style, but abundant
enough to feed an army.

Sancho observed all, contemplated all, and everything won his heart. The
first to captivate and take his fancy were the pots, out of which he would
have very gladly helped himself to a moderate pipkinful; then the wine
skins secured his affections; and lastly, the produce of the frying-pans,
if, indeed, such imposing cauldrons may be called frying-pans; and unable
to control himself or bear it any longer, he approached one of the busy
cooks and civilly but hungrily begged permission to soak a scrap of bread
in one of the pots; to which the cook made answer, “Brother, this is
not a day on which hunger is to have any sway, thanks to the rich Camacho;
get down and look about for a ladle and skim off a hen or two, and much
good may they do you.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t see one,” said Sancho.
</p>
<p>
“Wait a bit,” said the cook; “sinner that I am! how
particular and bashful you are!” and so saying, he seized a bucket
and plunging it into one of the half jars took up three hens and a couple
of geese, and said to Sancho, “Fall to, friend, and take the edge
off your appetite with these skimmings until dinner-time comes.”

</p>
<p>
“I have nothing to put them in,” said Sancho.
</p>
<p>
“Well then,” said the cook, “take spoon and all; for
Camacho’s wealth and happiness furnish everything.”
</p>
<p>
While Sancho fared thus, Don Quixote was watching the entrance, at one end
of the arcade, of some twelve peasants, all in holiday and gala dress,
mounted on twelve beautiful mares with rich handsome field trappings and a
number of little bells attached to their petrals, who, marshalled in
regular order, ran not one but several courses over the meadow, with
jubilant shouts and cries of “Long live Camacho and Quiteria! he as
rich as she is fair; and she the fairest on earth!”
</p>
<p>
Hearing this, Don Quixote said to himself, “It is easy to see these
folk have never seen my Dulcinea del Toboso; for if they had they would be
more moderate in their praises of this Quiteria of theirs.”
</p>
<p>
Shortly after this, several bands of dancers of various sorts began to
enter the arcade at different points, and among them one of sword-dancers
composed of some four-and-twenty lads of gallant and high-spirited mien,
clad in the finest and whitest of linen, and with handkerchiefs
embroidered in various colours with fine silk; and one of those on the
mares asked an active youth who led them if any of the dancers had been
wounded. “As yet, thank God, no one has been wounded,” said
he, “we are all safe and sound;” and he at once began to
execute complicated figures with the rest of his comrades, with so many
turns and so great dexterity, that although Don Quixote was well used to
see dances of the same kind, he thought he had never seen any so good as
this. He also admired another that came in composed of fair young maidens,
none of whom seemed to be under fourteen or over eighteen years of age,
all clad in green stuff, with their locks partly braided, partly flowing
loose, but all of such bright gold as to vie with the sunbeams, and over
them they wore garlands of jessamine, roses, amaranth, and honeysuckle. At
their head were a venerable old man and an ancient dame, more brisk and
active, however, than might have been expected from their years. The notes
of a Zamora bagpipe accompanied them, and with modesty in their
countenances and in their eyes, and lightness in their feet, they looked
the best dancers in the world.

</p>
<p>
Following these there came an artistic dance of the sort they call “speaking
dances.” It was composed of eight nymphs in two files, with the god
Cupid leading one and Interest the other, the former furnished with wings,
bow, quiver and arrows, the latter in a rich dress of gold and silk of
divers colours. The nymphs that followed Love bore their names written on
white parchment in large letters on their backs. “Poetry” was
the name of the first, “Wit” of the second, “Birth”
of the third, and “Valour” of the fourth. Those that followed
Interest were distinguished in the same way; the badge of the first
announced “Liberality,” that of the second “Largess,”
the third “Treasure,” and the fourth “Peaceful
Possession.” In front of them all came a wooden castle drawn by four
wild men, all clad in ivy and hemp stained green, and looking so natural
that they nearly terrified Sancho. On the front of the castle and on each
of the four sides of its frame it bore the inscription “Castle of
Caution.” Four skillful tabor and flute players accompanied them,
and the dance having been opened, Cupid, after executing two figures,
raised his eyes and bent his bow against a damsel who stood between the
turrets of the castle, and thus addressed her:
</p>
<p class="poem">
I am the mighty God whose sway<br>
Is potent over land and sea.<br>
The heavens above us own me; nay,<br>
The shades below acknowledge me.<br>
I know not fear, I have my will,<br>
Whate’er my whim or fancy be;<br>
For me there’s no impossible,<br>
I order, bind, forbid, set free.
</p>
<p>
Having concluded the stanza he discharged an arrow at the top of the
castle, and went back to his place. Interest then came forward and went
through two more figures, and as soon as the tabors ceased, he said:
</p>
<p class="poem">
But mightier than Love am I,<br>
Though Love it be that leads me on,<br>
Than mine no lineage is more high,<br>
Or older, underneath the sun.<br>
To use me rightly few know how,<br>
To act without me fewer still,<br>
For I am Interest, and I vow<br>
For evermore to do thy will.
</p>
<p>
Interest retired, and Poetry came forward, and when she had gone through
her figures like the others, fixing her eyes on the damsel of the castle,
she said:
</p>
<p class="poem">
With many a fanciful conceit,<br>
Fair Lady, winsome Poesy<br>
Her soul, an offering at thy feet,<br>
Presents in sonnets unto thee.<br>
If thou my homage wilt not scorn,<br>
Thy fortune, watched by envious eyes,<br>
On wings of poesy upborne<br>
Shall be exalted to the skies.
</p>
<p>
Poetry withdrew, and on the side of Interest Liberality advanced, and
after having gone through her figures, said:
</p>
<p class="poem">
To give, while shunning each extreme,<br>
The sparing hand, the over-free,<br>
Therein consists, so wise men deem,<br>
The virtue Liberality.<br>
But thee, fair lady, to enrich,<br>
Myself a prodigal I’ll prove,<br>
A vice not wholly shameful, which<br>
May find its fair excuse in love.
</p>
<p>
In the same manner all the characters of the two bands advanced and
retired, and each executed its figures, and delivered its verses, some of
them graceful, some burlesque, but Don Quixote’s memory (though he
had an excellent one) only carried away those that have been just quoted.
All then mingled together, forming chains and breaking off again with
graceful, unconstrained gaiety; and whenever Love passed in front of the
castle he shot his arrows up at it, while Interest broke gilded pellets
against it. At length, after they had danced a good while, Interest drew
out a great purse, made of the skin of a large brindled cat and to all
appearance full of money, and flung it at the castle, and with the force
of the blow the boards fell asunder and tumbled down, leaving the damsel
exposed and unprotected. Interest and the characters of his band advanced,
and throwing a great chain of gold over her neck pretended to take her and
lead her away captive, on seeing which, Love and his supporters made as
though they would release her, the whole action being to the accompaniment
of the tabors and in the form of a regular dance. The wild men made peace
between them, and with great dexterity readjusted and fixed the boards of
the castle, and the damsel once more ensconced herself within; and with
this the dance wound up, to the great enjoyment of the beholders.
</p>
<p>
Don Quixote asked one of the nymphs who it was that had composed and
arranged it. She replied that it was a beneficiary of the town who had a
nice taste in devising things of the sort. “I will lay a wager,”
said Don Quixote, “that the same bachelor or beneficiary is a
greater friend of Camacho’s than of Basilio’s, and that he is
better at satire than at vespers; he has introduced the accomplishments of
Basilio and the riches of Camacho very neatly into the dance.”
Sancho Panza, who was listening to all this, exclaimed, “The king is
my cock; I stick to Camacho.” “It is easy to see thou art a
clown, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “and one of that sort that
cry ‘Long life to the conqueror.’”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know of what sort I am,” returned Sancho,
“but I know very well I’ll never get such elegant skimmings
off Basilio’s pots as these I have got off Camacho’s;”
and he showed him the bucketful of geese and hens, and seizing one began
to eat with great gaiety and appetite, saying, “A fig for the
accomplishments of Basilio! As much as thou hast so much art thou worth,
and as much as thou art worth so much hast thou. As a grandmother of mine
used to say, there are only two families in the world, the Haves and the
Haven’ts; and she stuck to the Haves; and to this day, Señor Don
Quixote, people would sooner feel the pulse of ‘Have,’ than of
‘Know;’ an ass covered with gold looks better than a horse
with a pack-saddle. So once more I say I stick to Camacho, the bountiful
skimmings of whose pots are geese and hens, hares and rabbits; but of
Basilio’s, if any ever come to hand, or even to foot, they’ll
be only rinsings.”
</p>
<p>
“Hast thou finished thy harangue, Sancho?” said Don Quixote.
“Of course I have finished it,” replied Sancho, “because
I see your worship takes offence at it; but if it was not for that, there
was work enough cut out for three days.”
</p>
<p>
“God grant I may see thee dumb before I die, Sancho,” said Don
Quixote.
</p>
<p>
“At the rate we are going,” said Sancho, “I’ll be
chewing clay before your worship dies; and then, maybe, I’ll be so
dumb that I’ll not say a word until the end of the world, or, at
least, till the day of judgment.”
</p>
<p>
“Even should that happen, O Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “thy
silence will never come up to all thou hast talked, art talking, and wilt
talk all thy life; moreover, it naturally stands to reason, that my death
will come before thine; so I never expect to see thee dumb, not even when
thou art drinking or sleeping, and that is the utmost I can say.”
</p>
<p>
“In good faith, señor,” replied Sancho, “there’s
no trusting that fleshless one, I mean Death, who devours the lamb as soon
as the sheep, and, as I have heard our curate say, treads with equal foot
upon the lofty towers of kings and the lowly huts of the poor. That lady
is more mighty than dainty, she is in no way squeamish, she devours all and
is ready for all, and fills her alforjas with people of all sorts, ages,
and ranks. She is no reaper that sleeps out the noontide; at all times she
is reaping and cutting down, as well the dry grass as the green; she never
seems to chew, but bolts and swallows all that is put before her, for she
has a canine appetite that is never satisfied; and though she has no
belly, she shows she has a dropsy and is athirst to drink the lives of all
that live, as one would drink a jug of cold water.”
</p>
<p>
“Say no more, Sancho,” said Don Quixote at this; “don’t
try to better it, and risk a fall; for in truth what thou hast said about
death in thy rustic phrase is what a good preacher might have said. I tell
thee, Sancho, if thou hadst discretion equal to thy mother wit, thou
mightst take a pulpit in hand, and go about the world preaching fine
sermons.” “He preaches well who lives well,” said
Sancho, “and I know no more theology than that.”
</p>
<p>
“Nor needst thou,” said Don Quixote, “but I cannot
conceive or make out how it is that, the fear of God being the beginning
of wisdom, thou, who art more afraid of a lizard than of him, knowest so
much.”
</p>
<p>
“Pass judgment on your chivalries, señor,” returned Sancho,
“and don’t set yourself up to judge of other men’s fears
or braveries, for I am as good a fearer of God as my neighbours; but leave
me to despatch these skimmings, for all the rest is only idle talk that we
shall be called to account for in the other world;” and so saying,
he began a fresh attack on the bucket, with such a hearty appetite that he
aroused Don Quixote’s, who no doubt would have helped him had he not
been prevented by what must be told farther on.

While Don Quixote and Sancho were engaged in the discussion set forth the
last chapter, they heard loud shouts and a great noise, which were uttered
and made by the men on the mares as they went at full gallop, shouting, to
receive the bride and bridegroom, who were approaching with musical
instruments and pageantry of all sorts around them, and accompanied by the
priest and the relatives of both, and all the most distinguished people of
the surrounding villages. When Sancho saw the bride, he exclaimed, “By
my faith, she is not dressed like a country girl, but like some fine court
lady; egad, as well as I can make out, the patena she wears rich coral,
and her green Cuenca stuff is thirty-pile velvet; and then the white linen
trimming—by my oath, but it’s satin! Look at her hands—jet
rings on them! May I never have luck if they’re not gold rings, and
real gold, and set with pearls as white as a curdled milk, and every one
of them worth an eye of one’s head! Whoreson baggage, what hair she
has! if it’s not a wig, I never saw longer or fairer all the days of
my life. See how bravely she bears herself—and her shape! Wouldn’t
you say she was like a walking palm tree loaded with clusters of dates?
for the trinkets she has hanging from her hair and neck look just like
them. I swear in my heart she is a brave lass, and fit ‘to pass over
the banks of Flanders.’”
</p>
<p>
Don Quixote laughed at Sancho’s boorish eulogies and thought that,
saving his lady Dulcinea del Toboso, he had never seen a more beautiful
woman. The fair Quiteria appeared somewhat pale, which was, no doubt,
because of the bad night brides always pass dressing themselves out for
their wedding on the morrow. They advanced towards a theatre that stood on
one side of the meadow decked with carpets and boughs, where they were to
plight their troth, and from which they were to behold the dances and
plays; but at the moment of their arrival at the spot they heard a loud
outcry behind them, and a voice exclaiming, “Wait a little, ye, as
inconsiderate as ye are hasty!” At these words all turned round, and
perceived that the speaker was a man clad in what seemed to be a loose
black coat garnished with crimson patches like flames. He was crowned (as
was presently seen) with a crown of gloomy cypress, and in his hand he
held a long staff. As he approached he was recognised by everyone as the
gay Basilio, and all waited anxiously to see what would come of his words,
in dread of some catastrophe in consequence of his appearance at such a
moment. He came up at last weary and breathless, and planting himself in
front of the bridal pair, drove his staff, which had a steel spike at the
end, into the ground, and, with a pale face and eyes fixed on Quiteria, he
thus addressed her in a hoarse, trembling voice:
</p>
<p>
“Well dost thou know, ungrateful Quiteria, that according to the
holy law we acknowledge, so long as live thou canst take no husband; nor
art thou ignorant either that, in my hopes that time and my own exertions
would improve my fortunes, I have never failed to observe the respect due
to thy honour; but thou, casting behind thee all thou owest to my true
love, wouldst surrender what is mine to another whose wealth serves to
bring him not only good fortune but supreme happiness; and now to complete
it (not that I think he deserves it, but inasmuch as heaven is pleased to
bestow it upon him), I will, with my own hands, do away with the obstacle
that may interfere with it, and remove myself from between you. Long live
the rich Camacho! many a happy year may he live with the ungrateful
Quiteria! and let the poor Basilio die, Basilio whose poverty clipped the
wings of his happiness, and brought him to the grave!”
</p>
<p>
And so saying, he seized the staff he had driven into the ground, and
leaving one half of it fixed there, showed it to be a sheath that
concealed a tolerably long rapier; and, what may be called its hilt being
planted in the ground, he swiftly, coolly, and deliberately threw himself
upon it, and in an instant the bloody point and half the steel blade
appeared at his back, the unhappy man falling to the earth bathed in his
blood, and transfixed by his own weapon.
</p>
<p>
His friends at once ran to his aid, filled with grief at his misery and
sad fate, and Don Quixote, dismounting from Rocinante, hastened to support
him, and took him in his arms, and found he had not yet ceased to breathe.
They were about to draw out the rapier, but the priest who was standing by
objected to its being withdrawn before he had confessed him, as the
instant of its withdrawal would be that of this death. Basilio, however,
reviving slightly, said in a weak voice, as though in pain, “If thou
wouldst consent, cruel Quiteria, to give me thy hand as my bride in this
last fatal moment, I might still hope that my rashness would find pardon,
as by its means I attained the bliss of being thine.”
</p>
<p>
Hearing this the priest bade him think of the welfare of his soul rather
than of the cravings of the body, and in all earnestness implore God’s
pardon for his sins and for his rash resolve; to which Basilio replied
that he was determined not to confess unless Quiteria first gave him her
hand in marriage, for that happiness would compose his mind and give him
courage to make his confession.
</p>
<p>
Don Quixote hearing the wounded man’s entreaty, exclaimed aloud that
what Basilio asked was just and reasonable, and moreover a request that
might be easily complied with; and that it would be as much to Señor
Camacho’s honour to receive the lady Quiteria as the widow of the
brave Basilio as if he received her direct from her father.
</p>
<p>
“In this case,” said he, “it will be only to say ‘yes,’
and no consequences can follow the utterance of the word, for the nuptial
couch of this marriage must be the grave.”
</p>
<p>
Camacho was listening to all this, perplexed and bewildered and not
knowing what to say or do; but so urgent were the entreaties of Basilio’s
friends, imploring him to allow Quiteria to give him her hand, so that his
soul, quitting this life in despair, should not be lost, that they moved,
nay, forced him, to say that if Quiteria were willing to give it he was
satisfied, as it was only putting off the fulfillment of his wishes for a
moment. At once all assailed Quiteria and pressed her, some with prayers,
and others with tears, and others with persuasive arguments, to give her
hand to poor Basilio; but she, harder than marble and more unmoved than
any statue, seemed unable or unwilling to utter a word, nor would she have
given any reply had not the priest bade her decide quickly what she meant
to do, as Basilio now had his soul at his teeth, and there was no time for
hesitation.
</p>

</p>
<p>
On this the fair Quiteria, to all appearance distressed, grieved, and
repentant, advanced without a word to where Basilio lay, his eyes already
turned in his head, his breathing short and painful, murmuring the name of
Quiteria between his teeth, and apparently about to die like a heathen and
not like a Christian. Quiteria approached him, and kneeling, demanded his
hand by signs without speaking. Basilio opened his eyes and gazing fixedly
at her, said, “O Quiteria, why hast thou turned compassionate at a
moment when thy compassion will serve as a dagger to rob me of life, for I
have not now the strength left either to bear the happiness thou givest me
in accepting me as thine, or to suppress the pain that is rapidly drawing
the dread shadow of death over my eyes? What I entreat of thee, O thou
fatal star to me, is that the hand thou demandest of me and wouldst give
me, be not given out of complaisance or to deceive me afresh, but that
thou confess and declare that without any constraint upon thy will thou
givest it to me as to thy lawful husband; for it is not meet that thou
shouldst trifle with me at such a moment as this, or have recourse to
falsehoods with one who has dealt so truly by thee.”

While uttering these words he showed such weakness that the bystanders
expected each return of faintness would take his life with it. Then
Quiteria, overcome with modesty and shame, holding in her right hand the
hand of Basilio, said, “No force would bend my will; as freely,
therefore, as it is possible for me to do so, I give thee the hand of a
lawful wife, and take thine if thou givest it to me of thine own free
will, untroubled and unaffected by the calamity thy hasty act has brought
upon thee.”

“Yes, I give it,” said Basilio, “not agitated or
distracted, but with unclouded reason that heaven is pleased to grant me,
thus do I give myself to be thy husband.”

<p>
“And I give myself to be thy wife,” said Quiteria, “whether
thou livest many years, or they carry thee from my arms to the grave.”

“For one so badly wounded,” observed Sancho at this point,
“this young man has a great deal to say; they should make him leave
off billing and cooing, and attend to his soul; for to my thinking he has
it more on his tongue than at his teeth.”

Basilio and Quiteria having thus joined hands, the priest, deeply moved
and with tears in his eyes, pronounced the blessing upon them, and
implored heaven to grant an easy passage to the soul of the newly wedded
man, who, the instant he received the blessing, started nimbly to his feet
and with unparalleled effrontery pulled out the rapier that had been
sheathed in his body. All the bystanders were astounded, and some, more
simple than inquiring, began shouting, “A miracle, a miracle!”
But Basilio replied, “No miracle, no miracle; only a trick, a trick!”
The priest, perplexed and amazed, made haste to examine the wound with
both hands, and found that the blade had passed, not through Basilio’s
flesh and ribs, but through a hollow iron tube full of blood, which he had
adroitly fixed at the place, the blood, as was afterwards ascertained,
having been so prepared as not to congeal. In short, the priest and
Camacho and most of those present saw they were tricked and made fools of.
The bride showed no signs of displeasure at the deception; on the
contrary, hearing them say that the marriage, being fraudulent, would not
be valid, she said that she confirmed it afresh, whence they all concluded
that the affair had been planned by agreement and understanding between
the pair, whereat Camacho and his supporters were so mortified that they
proceeded to revenge themselves by violence, and a great number of them
drawing their swords attacked Basilio, in whose protection as many more
swords were in an instant unsheathed, while Don Quixote taking the lead on
horseback, with his lance over his arm and well covered with his shield,
made all give way before him. Sancho, who never found any pleasure or
enjoyment in such doings, retreated to the wine-jars from which he had
taken his delectable skimmings, considering that, as a holy place, that
spot would be respected.

“Hold, sirs, hold!” cried Don Quixote in a loud voice; “we
have no right to take vengeance for wrongs that love may do to us:
remember love and war are the same thing, and as in war it is allowable
