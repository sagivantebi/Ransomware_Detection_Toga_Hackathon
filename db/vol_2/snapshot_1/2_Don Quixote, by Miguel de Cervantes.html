the subject. To be brief, its Second Part, according to the translation,
began in this way:
</p>
<p>
With trenchant swords upraised and poised on high, it seemed as though the
two valiant and wrathful combatants stood threatening heaven, and earth,
and hell, with such resolution and determination did they bear themselves.
The fiery Biscayan was the first to strike a blow, which was delivered
with such force and fury that had not the sword turned in its course, that
single stroke would have sufficed to put an end to the bitter struggle and
to all the adventures of our knight; but that good fortune which reserved
him for greater things, turned aside the sword of his adversary, so that
although it smote him upon the left shoulder, it did him no more harm than
to strip all that side of its armour, carrying away a great part of his
helmet with half of his ear, all which with fearful ruin fell to the
ground, leaving him in a sorry plight.
</p>
<p>
Good God! Who is there that could properly describe the rage that filled
the heart of our Manchegan when he saw himself dealt with in this fashion?
All that can be said is, it was such that he again raised himself in his
stirrups, and, grasping his sword more firmly with both hands, he came
down on the Biscayan with such fury, smiting him full over the cushion and
over the head, that—even so good a shield proving useless—as
if a mountain had fallen on him, he began to bleed from nose, mouth, and
ears, reeling as if about to fall backwards from his mule, as no doubt he
would have done had he not flung his arms about its neck; at the same
time, however, he slipped his feet out of the stirrups and then unclasped
his arms, and the mule, taking fright at the terrible blow, made off
across the plain, and with a few plunges flung its master to the ground.
Don Quixote stood looking on very calmly, and, when he saw him fall,
leaped from his horse and with great briskness ran to him, and, presenting
the point of his sword to his eyes, bade him surrender, or he would cut
his head off. The Biscayan was so bewildered that he was unable to answer
a word, and it would have gone hard with him, so blind was Don Quixote,
had not the ladies in the coach, who had hitherto been watching the combat
in great terror, hastened to where he stood and implored him with earnest
entreaties to grant them the great grace and favour of sparing their
squire’s life; to which Don Quixote replied with much gravity and dignity,
“In truth, fair ladies, I am well content to do what ye ask of me; but it
must be on one condition and understanding, which is that this knight
promise me to go to the village of El Toboso, and on my behalf present
himself before the peerless lady Dulcinea, that she deal with him as shall
be most pleasing to her.”
</p>
<p>
The terrified and disconsolate ladies, without discussing Don Quixote’s
demand or asking who Dulcinea might be, promised that their squire should
do all that had been commanded.
</p>
<p>
“Then, on the faith of that promise,” said Don Quixote, “I shall do him no
further harm, though he well deserves it of me.”

<p>
Now by this time Sancho had risen, rather the worse for the handling of
the friars’ muleteers, and stood watching the battle of his master, Don
Quixote, and praying to God in his heart that it might be his will to
grant him the victory, and that he might thereby win some island to make
him governor of, as he had promised. Seeing, therefore, that the struggle
was now over, and that his master was returning to mount Rocinante, he
approached to hold the stirrup for him, and, before he could mount, he
went on his knees before him, and taking his hand, kissed it saying, “May
it please your worship, Señor Don Quixote, to give me the government of
that island which has been won in this hard fight, for be it ever so big I
feel myself in sufficient force to be able to govern it as much and as
well as anyone in the world who has ever governed islands.”
</p>
<p>
To which Don Quixote replied, “Thou must take notice, brother Sancho, that
this adventure and those like it are not adventures of islands, but of
cross-roads, in which nothing is got except a broken head or an ear the
less: have patience, for adventures will present themselves from which I
may make you, not only a governor, but something more.”
</p>
<p>
Sancho gave him many thanks, and again kissing his hand and the skirt of
his hauberk, helped him to mount Rocinante, and mounting his ass himself,
proceeded to follow his master, who at a brisk pace, without taking leave,
or saying anything further to the ladies belonging to the coach, turned
into a wood that was hard by. Sancho followed him at his ass’s best trot,
but Rocinante stepped out so that, seeing himself left behind, he was
forced to call to his master to wait for him. Don Quixote did so, reining
in Rocinante until his weary squire came up, who on reaching him said, “It
seems to me, señor, it would be prudent in us to go and take refuge in
some church, for, seeing how mauled he with whom you fought has been left,
it will be no wonder if they give information of the affair to the Holy
Brotherhood and arrest us, and, faith, if they do, before we come out of
gaol we shall have to sweat for it.”
</p>
<p>
“Peace,” said Don Quixote; “where hast thou ever seen or heard that a
knight-errant has been arraigned before a court of justice, however many
homicides he may have committed?”
</p>
<p>
“I know nothing about omecils,” answered Sancho, “nor in my life have had
anything to do with one; I only know that the Holy Brotherhood looks after
those who fight in the fields, and in that other matter I do not meddle.”
</p>
<p>
“Then thou needst have no uneasiness, my friend,” said Don Quixote, “for I
will deliver thee out of the hands of the Chaldeans, much more out of
those of the Brotherhood. But tell me, as thou livest, hast thou seen a
more valiant knight than I in all the known world; hast thou read in
history of any who has or had higher mettle in attack, more spirit in
maintaining it, more dexterity in wounding or skill in overthrowing?”
</p>
<p>
“The truth is,” answered Sancho, “that I have never read any history, for
I can neither read nor write, but what I will venture to bet is that a
more daring master than your worship I have never served in all the days
of my life, and God grant that this daring be not paid for where I have
said; what I beg of your worship is to dress your wound, for a great deal
of blood flows from that ear, and I have here some lint and a little white
ointment in the alforjas.”
</p>
<p>
“All that might be well dispensed with,” said Don Quixote, “if I had
remembered to make a vial of the balsam of Fierabras, for time and
medicine are saved by one single drop.”
</p>
<p>
“What vial and what balsam is that?” said Sancho Panza.
</p>
<p>
“It is a balsam,” answered Don Quixote, “the receipt of which I have in my
memory, with which one need have no fear of death, or dread dying of any
wound; and so when I make it and give it to thee thou hast nothing to do
when in some battle thou seest they have cut me in half through the middle
of the body—as is wont to happen frequently—but neatly and
with great nicety, ere the blood congeal, to place that portion of the
body which shall have fallen to the ground upon the other half which
remains in the saddle, taking care to fit it on evenly and exactly. Then
thou shalt give me to drink but two drops of the balsam I have mentioned,
and thou shalt see me become sounder than an apple.”
</p>
<p>
“If that be so,” said Panza, “I renounce henceforth the government of the
promised island, and desire nothing more in payment of my many and
faithful services than that your worship give me the receipt of this
supreme liquor, for I am persuaded it will be worth more than two reals an
ounce anywhere, and I want no more to pass the rest of my life in ease and
honour; but it remains to be told if it costs much to make it.”
</p>
<p>
“With less than three reals, six quarts of it may be made,” said Don
Quixote.
</p>
<p>
“Sinner that I am!” said Sancho, “then why does your worship put off
making it and teaching it to me?”
</p>
<p>
“Peace, friend,” answered Don Quixote; “greater secrets I mean to teach
thee and greater favours to bestow upon thee; and for the present let us
see to the dressing, for my ear pains me more than I could wish.”
</p>
<p>
Sancho took out some lint and ointment from the alforjas; but when Don
Quixote came to see his helmet shattered, he was like to lose his senses,
and clapping his hand upon his sword and raising his eyes to heaven, he
said, “I swear by the Creator of all things and the four Gospels in their
fullest extent, to do as the great Marquis of Mantua did when he swore to
avenge the death of his nephew Baldwin (and that was not to eat bread from
a table-cloth, nor embrace his wife, and other points which, though I
cannot now call them to mind, I here grant as expressed) until I take
complete vengeance upon him who has committed such an offence against me.”
</p>
<p>
Hearing this, Sancho said to him, “Your worship should bear in mind, Señor
Don Quixote, that if the knight has done what was commanded him in going
to present himself before my lady Dulcinea del Toboso, he will have done
all that he was bound to do, and does not deserve further punishment
unless he commits some new offence.”
</p>
<p>
“Thou hast said well and hit the point,” answered Don Quixote; and so I
recall the oath in so far as relates to taking fresh vengeance on him, but
I make and confirm it anew to lead the life I have said until such time as
I take by force from some knight another helmet such as this and as good;
and think not, Sancho, that I am raising smoke with straw in doing so, for
I have one to imitate in the matter, since the very same thing to a hair
happened in the case of Mambrino’s helmet, which cost Sacripante so dear.”
</p>
<p>
“Señor,” replied Sancho, “let your worship send all such oaths to the
devil, for they are very pernicious to salvation and prejudicial to the
conscience; just tell me now, if for several days to come we fall in with
no man armed with a helmet, what are we to do? Is the oath to be observed
in spite of all the inconvenience and discomfort it will be to sleep in
your clothes, and not to sleep in a house, and a thousand other
mortifications contained in the oath of that old fool the Marquis of
Mantua, which your worship is now wanting to revive? Let your worship
observe that there are no men in armour travelling on any of these roads,
nothing but carriers and carters, who not only do not wear helmets, but
perhaps never heard tell of them all their lives.”
</p>
<p>
“Thou art wrong there,” said Don Quixote, “for we shall not have been
above two hours among these cross-roads before we see more men in armour
than came to Albraca to win the fair Angelica.”
</p>
<p>
“Enough,” said Sancho; “so be it then, and God grant us success, and that
the time for winning that island which is costing me so dear may soon
come, and then let me die.”
</p>
<p>
“I have already told thee, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “not to give thyself
any uneasiness on that score; for if an island should fail, there is the
kingdom of Denmark, or of Sobradisa, which will fit thee as a ring fits
the finger, and all the more that, being on <i>terra firma</i>, thou wilt all the
better enjoy thyself. But let us leave that to its own time; see if thou
hast anything for us to eat in those alforjas, because we must presently
go in quest of some castle where we may lodge to-night and make the balsam
I told thee of, for I swear to thee by God, this ear is giving me great
pain.”
</p>
<p>
“I have here an onion and a little cheese and a few scraps of bread,” said
Sancho, “but they are not victuals fit for a valiant knight like your
worship.”
</p>
<p>
“How little thou knowest about it,” answered Don Quixote; “I would have
thee to know, Sancho, that it is the glory of knights-errant to go without
eating for a month, and even when they do eat, that it should be of what
comes first to hand; and this would have been clear to thee hadst thou
read as many histories as I have, for, though they are very many, among
them all I have found no mention made of knights-errant eating, unless by
accident or at some sumptuous banquets prepared for them, and the rest of
the time they passed in dalliance. And though it is plain they could not
do without eating and performing all the other natural functions, because,
in fact, they were men like ourselves, it is plain too that, wandering as
they did the most part of their lives through woods and wilds and without
a cook, their most usual fare would be rustic viands such as those thou
now offer me; so that, friend Sancho, let not that distress thee which
pleases me, and do not seek to make a new world or pervert
knight-errantry.”
</p>
<p>
“Pardon me, your worship,” said Sancho, “for, as I cannot read or write,
as I said just now, I neither know nor comprehend the rules of the
profession of chivalry: henceforward I will stock the alforjas with every
kind of dry fruit for your worship, as you are a knight; and for myself,
as I am not one, I will furnish them with poultry and other things more
substantial.”
</p>
<p>
“I do not say, Sancho,” replied Don Quixote, “that it is imperative on
knights-errant not to eat anything else but the fruits thou speakest of;
only that their more usual diet must be those, and certain herbs they
found in the fields which they knew and I know too.”
</p>
<p>
“A good thing it is,” answered Sancho, “to know those herbs, for to my
thinking it will be needful some day to put that knowledge into practice.”
</p>
<p>
And here taking out what he said he had brought, the pair made their
repast peaceably and sociably. But anxious to find quarters for the night,
they with all despatch made an end of their poor dry fare, mounted at
once, and made haste to reach some habitation before night set in; but
daylight and the hope of succeeding in their object failed them close by
the huts of some goatherds, so they determined to pass the night there,
and it was as much to Sancho’s discontent not to have reached a house, as
it was to his master’s satisfaction to sleep under the open heaven, for he
fancied that each time this happened to him he performed an act of
ownership that helped to prove his chivalry.

WHAT BEFELL DON QUIXOTE WITH CERTAIN GOATHERDS

</p>
<p>
He was cordially welcomed by the goatherds, and Sancho, having as best he
could put up Rocinante and the ass, drew towards the fragrance that came
from some pieces of salted goat simmering in a pot on the fire; and though
he would have liked at once to try if they were ready to be transferred
from the pot to the stomach, he refrained from doing so as the goatherds
removed them from the fire, and laying sheepskins on the ground, quickly
spread their rude table, and with signs of hearty good-will invited them
both to share what they had. Round the skins six of the men belonging to
the fold seated themselves, having first with rough politeness pressed Don
Quixote to take a seat upon a trough which they placed for him upside
down. Don Quixote seated himself, and Sancho remained standing to serve
the cup, which was made of horn. Seeing him standing, his master said to
him:
</p>
<p>
“That thou mayest see, Sancho, the good that knight-errantry contains in
itself, and how those who fill any office in it are on the high road to be
speedily honoured and esteemed by the world, I desire that thou seat
thyself here at my side and in the company of these worthy people, and
that thou be one with me who am thy master and natural lord, and that thou
eat from my plate and drink from whatever I drink from; for the same may
be said of knight-errantry as of love, that it levels all.”
</p>
<p>
“Great thanks,” said Sancho, “but I may tell your worship that provided I
have enough to eat, I can eat it as well, or better, standing, and by
myself, than seated alongside of an emperor. And indeed, if the truth is
to be told, what I eat in my corner without form or fuss has much more
relish for me, even though it be bread and onions, than the turkeys of
those other tables where I am forced to chew slowly, drink little, wipe my
mouth every minute, and cannot sneeze or cough if I want or do other
things that are the privileges of liberty and solitude. So, señor, as for
these honours which your worship would put upon me as a servant and
follower of knight-errantry, exchange them for other things which may be
of more use and advantage to me; for these, though I fully acknowledge
them as received, I renounce from this moment to the end of the world.”
</p>
<p>
“For all that,” said Don Quixote, “thou must seat thyself, because him who
humbleth himself God exalteth;” and seizing him by the arm he forced him
to sit down beside himself.
</p>
<p>
The goatherds did not understand this jargon about squires and
knights-errant, and all they did was to eat in silence and stare at their
guests, who with great elegance and appetite were stowing away pieces as
big as one’s fist. The course of meat finished, they spread upon the
sheepskins a great heap of parched acorns, and with them they put down a
half cheese harder than if it had been made of mortar. All this while the
horn was not idle, for it went round so constantly, now full, now empty,
like the bucket of a water-wheel, that it soon drained one of the two
wine-skins that were in sight. When Don Quixote had quite appeased his
appetite he took up a handful of the acorns, and contemplating them
attentively delivered himself somewhat in this fashion:
</p>
<p>
“Happy the age, happy the time, to which the ancients gave the name of
golden, not because in that fortunate age the gold so coveted in this our
iron one was gained without toil, but because they that lived in it knew
not the two words “<i>mine</i>” and “<i>thine</i>”! In that blessed age all things were
in common; to win the daily food no labour was required of any save to
stretch forth his hand and gather it from the sturdy oaks that stood
generously inviting him with their sweet ripe fruit. The clear streams and
running brooks yielded their savoury limpid waters in noble abundance. The
busy and sagacious bees fixed their republic in the clefts of the rocks
and hollows of the trees, offering without usance the plenteous produce of
their fragrant toil to every hand. The mighty cork trees, unenforced save
of their own courtesy, shed the broad light bark that served at first to
roof the houses supported by rude stakes, a protection against the
inclemency of heaven alone. Then all was peace, all friendship, all
concord; as yet the dull share of the crooked plough had not dared to rend
and pierce the tender bowels of our first mother that without compulsion
yielded from every portion of her broad fertile bosom all that could
satisfy, sustain, and delight the children that then possessed her. Then
was it that the innocent and fair young shepherdess roamed from vale to
vale and hill to hill, with flowing locks, and no more garments than were
needful modestly to cover what modesty seeks and ever sought to hide. Nor
were their ornaments like those in use to-day, set off by Tyrian purple,
and silk tortured in endless fashions, but the wreathed leaves of the
green dock and ivy, wherewith they went as bravely and becomingly decked
as our Court dames with all the rare and far-fetched artifices that idle
curiosity has taught them. Then the love-thoughts of the heart clothed
themselves simply and naturally as the heart conceived them, nor sought to
commend themselves by forced and rambling verbiage. Fraud, deceit, or
malice had then not yet mingled with truth and sincerity. Justice held her
ground, undisturbed and unassailed by the efforts of favour and of
interest, that now so much impair, pervert, and beset her. Arbitrary law
had not yet established itself in the mind of the judge, for then there
was no cause to judge and no one to be judged. Maidens and modesty, as I
have said, wandered at will alone and unattended, without fear of insult
from lawlessness or libertine assault, and if they were undone it was of
their own will and pleasure. But now in this hateful age of ours not one
is safe, not though some new labyrinth like that of Crete conceal and
surround her; even there the pestilence of gallantry will make its way to
them through chinks or on the air by the zeal of its accursed importunity,
and, despite of all seclusion, lead them to ruin. In defence of these, as
time advanced and wickedness increased, the order of knights-errant was
instituted, to defend maidens, to protect widows and to succour the
orphans and the needy. To this order I belong, brother goatherds, to whom
I return thanks for the hospitality and kindly welcome ye offer me and my
squire; for though by natural law all living are bound to show favour to
knights-errant, yet, seeing that without knowing this obligation ye have
welcomed and feasted me, it is right that with all the good-will in my
power I should thank you for yours.”
</p>
<p>
<br><br><br><br> <a id="c11b"></a>
</p>
<div class="fig" style="width:60%;">

<br><br><br>
</p>
<p>
All this long harangue (which might very well have been spared) our knight
delivered because the acorns they gave him reminded him of the golden age;
and the whim seized him to address all this unnecessary argument to the
goatherds, who listened to him gaping in amazement without saying a word
in reply. Sancho likewise held his peace and ate acorns, and paid repeated
visits to the second wine-skin, which they had hung up on a cork tree to
keep the wine cool.
</p>
<p>
Don Quixote was longer in talking than the supper in finishing, at the end
of which one of the goatherds said, “That your worship, señor
knight-errant, may say with more truth that we show you hospitality with
ready good-will, we will give you amusement and pleasure by making one of
our comrades sing: he will be here before long, and he is a very
intelligent youth and deep in love, and what is more he can read and write
and play on the rebeck to perfection.”
</p>
<p>
The goatherd had hardly done speaking, when the notes of the rebeck
reached their ears; and shortly after, the player came up, a very
good-looking young man of about two-and-twenty. His comrades asked him if
he had supped, and on his replying that he had, he who had already made
the offer said to him:
</p>
<p>
“In that case, Antonio, thou mayest as well do us the pleasure of singing
a little, that the gentleman, our guest, may see that even in the
mountains and woods there are musicians: we have told him of thy
accomplishments, and we want thee to show them and prove that we say true;
so, as thou livest, pray sit down and sing that ballad about thy love that
thy uncle the prebendary made thee, and that was so much liked in the
town.”
</p>
<p>
“With all my heart,” said the young man, and without waiting for more
pressing he seated himself on the trunk of a felled oak, and tuning his
rebeck, presently began to sing to these words.
</p>
<p class="poem">
ANTONIO’S BALLAD<br>
<br>
Thou dost love me well, Olalla;<br>
Well I know it, even though<br>
Love’s mute tongues, thine eyes, have never<br>
By their glances told me so.<br>
<br>
For I know my love thou knowest,<br>
Therefore thine to claim I dare:<br>
Once it ceases to be secret,<br>
Love need never feel despair.<br>
<br>
True it is, Olalla, sometimes<br>
Thou hast all too plainly shown<br>
That thy heart is brass in hardness,<br>
And thy snowy bosom stone.<br>
<br>
Yet for all that, in thy coyness,<br>
And thy fickle fits between,<br>
Hope is there—at least the border<br>
Of her garment may be seen.<br>
<br>
Lures to faith are they, those glimpses,<br>
And to faith in thee I hold;<br>
Kindness cannot make it stronger,<br>
Coldness cannot make it cold.<br>
<br>
If it be that love is gentle,<br>
In thy gentleness I see<br>
Something holding out assurance<br>
To the hope of winning thee.<br>
<br>
If it be that in devotion<br>
Lies a power hearts to move,<br>
That which every day I show thee,<br>
Helpful to my suit should prove.<br>
<br>
Many a time thou must have noticed—<br>
If to notice thou dost care—<br>
How I go about on Monday<br>
Dressed in all my Sunday wear.<br>
<br>
Love’s eyes love to look on brightness;<br>
Love loves what is gaily drest;<br>
Sunday, Monday, all I care is<br>
Thou shouldst see me in my best.<br>
<br>
No account I make of dances,<br>
Or of strains that pleased thee so,<br>
Keeping thee awake from midnight<br>
Till the cocks began to crow;<br>
<br>
Or of how I roundly swore it<br>
That there’s none so fair as thou;<br>
True it is, but as I said it,<br>
By the girls I’m hated now.<br>
<br>
For Teresa of the hillside<br>
At my praise of thee was sore;<br>
Said, “You think you love an angel;<br>
It’s a monkey you adore;<br>
<br>
“Caught by all her glittering trinkets,<br>
And her borrowed braids of hair,<br>
And a host of made-up beauties<br>
That would Love himself ensnare.”<br>
<br>
’Twas a lie, and so I told her,<br>
And her cousin at the word<br>
Gave me his defiance for it;<br>
And what followed thou hast heard.<br>
<br>
Mine is no high-flown affection,<br>
Mine no passion <i>par amours</i>—<br>
As they call it—what I offer<br>
Is an honest love, and pure.<br>
<br>
Cunning cords the holy Church has,<br>
Cords of softest silk they be;<br>
Put thy neck beneath the yoke, dear;<br>
Mine will follow, thou wilt see.<br>
<br>
Else—and once for all I swear it<br>
By the saint of most renown—<br>
If I ever quit the mountains,<br>
’Twill be in a friar’s gown.<br>
</p>
<p>
Here the goatherd brought his song to an end, and though Don Quixote
entreated him to sing more, Sancho had no mind that way, being more
inclined for sleep than for listening to songs; so said he to his master,
“Your worship will do well to settle at once where you mean to pass the
night, for the labour these good men are at all day does not allow them to
spend the night in singing.”
</p>
<p>
“I understand thee, Sancho,” replied Don Quixote; “I perceive clearly that
those visits to the wine-skin demand compensation in sleep rather than in
music.”
</p>
<p>
“It’s sweet to us all, blessed be God,” said Sancho.
</p>
<p>
“I do not deny it,” replied Don Quixote; “but settle thyself where thou
wilt; those of my calling are more becomingly employed in watching than in
sleeping; still it would be as well if thou wert to dress this ear for me
again, for it is giving me more pain than it need.”
</p>
<p>
Sancho did as he bade him, but one of the goatherds, seeing the wound,
told him not to be uneasy, as he would apply a remedy with which it would
be soon healed; and gathering some leaves of rosemary, of which there was
a great quantity there, he chewed them and mixed them with a little salt,
and applying them to the ear he secured them firmly with a bandage,
assuring him that no other treatment would be required, and so it proved.

<p>
Just then another young man, one of those who fetched their provisions
from the village, came up and said, “Do you know what is going on in the
village, comrades?”
</p>
<p>
“How could we know it?” replied one of them.
</p>
<p>
“Well, then, you must know,” continued the young man, “this morning that
famous student-shepherd called Chrysostom died, and it is rumoured that he
died of love for that devil of a village girl the daughter of Guillermo
the Rich, she that wanders about the wolds here in the dress of a
shepherdess.”
</p>
<p>
“You mean Marcela?” said one.
</p>
<p>
“Her I mean,” answered the goatherd; “and the best of it is, he has
directed in his will that he is to be buried in the fields like a Moor,
and at the foot of the rock where the Cork-tree spring is, because, as the
story goes (and they say he himself said so), that was the place where he
first saw her. And he has also left other directions which the clergy of
the village say should not and must not be obeyed because they savour of
paganism. To all which his great friend Ambrosio the student, he who, like
him, also went dressed as a shepherd, replies that everything must be done
without any omission according to the directions left by Chrysostom, and
about this the village is all in commotion; however, report says that,
after all, what Ambrosio and all the shepherds his friends desire will be
done, and to-morrow they are coming to bury him with great ceremony where
I said. I am sure it will be something worth seeing; at least I will not
fail to go and see it even if I knew I should not return to the village
to-morrow.”
</p>
<p>
“We will do the same,” answered the goatherds, “and cast lots to see who
must stay to mind the goats of all.”
</p>
<p>
“Thou sayest well, Pedro,” said one, “though there will be no need of
taking that trouble, for I will stay behind for all; and don’t suppose it
is virtue or want of curiosity in me; it is that the splinter that ran
into my foot the other day will not let me walk.”
</p>
<p>
“For all that, we thank thee,” answered Pedro.
</p>
<p>
Don Quixote asked Pedro to tell him who the dead man was and who the
shepherdess, to which Pedro replied that all he knew was that the dead man
was a wealthy gentleman belonging to a village in those mountains, who had
been a student at Salamanca for many years, at the end of which he
returned to his village with the reputation of being very learned and
deeply read. “Above all, they said, he was learned in the science of the
stars and of what went on yonder in the heavens and the sun and the moon,
for he told us of the cris of the sun and moon to exact time.”
</p>
<p>
“Eclipse it is called, friend, not cris, the darkening of those two
luminaries,” said Don Quixote; but Pedro, not troubling himself with
trifles, went on with his story, saying, “Also he foretold when the year
was going to be one of abundance or estility.”
</p>
<p>
“Sterility, you mean,” said Don Quixote.
</p>
<p>
“Sterility or estility,” answered Pedro, “it is all the same in the end.
And I can tell you that by this his father and friends who believed him
grew very rich because they did as he advised them, bidding them ‘sow
barley this year, not wheat; this year you may sow pulse and not barley;
the next there will be a full oil crop, and the three following not a drop
will be got.’”
</p>
<p>
“That science is called astrology,” said Don Quixote.
</p>
<p>
“I do not know what it is called,” replied Pedro, “but I know that he knew
all this and more besides. But, to make an end, not many months had passed
after he returned from Salamanca, when one day he appeared dressed as a
shepherd with his crook and sheepskin, having put off the long gown he
wore as a scholar; and at the same time his great friend, Ambrosio by
name, who had been his companion in his studies, took to the shepherd’s
dress with him. I forgot to say that Chrysostom, who is dead, was a great
man for writing verses, so much so that he made carols for Christmas Eve,
and plays for Corpus Christi, which the young men of our village acted,
and all said they were excellent. When the villagers saw the two scholars
so unexpectedly appearing in shepherd’s dress, they were lost in wonder,
and could not guess what had led them to make so extraordinary a change.
About this time the father of our Chrysostom died, and he was left heir to
a large amount of property in chattels as well as in land, no small number
of cattle and sheep, and a large sum of money, of all of which the young
man was left dissolute owner, and indeed he was deserving of it all, for
he was a very good comrade, and kind-hearted, and a friend of worthy folk,
and had a countenance like a benediction. Presently it came to be known
that he had changed his dress with no other object than to wander about
these wastes after that shepherdess Marcela our lad mentioned a while ago,
with whom the deceased Chrysostom had fallen in love. And I must tell you
now, for it is well you should know it, who this girl is; perhaps, and
even without any perhaps, you will not have heard anything like it all the
days of your life, though you should live more years than sarna.”
</p>
<p>
“Say Sarra,” said Don Quixote, unable to endure the goatherd’s confusion
of words.
</p>
<p>
“The sarna lives long enough,” answered Pedro; “and if, señor, you must go
finding fault with words at every step, we shall not make an end of it
this twelvemonth.”
</p>
<p>
“Pardon me, friend,” said Don Quixote; “but, as there is such a difference
between sarna and Sarra, I told you of it; however, you have answered very
rightly, for sarna lives longer than Sarra: so continue your story, and I
will not object any more to anything.”
</p>
<p>
“I say then, my dear sir,” said the goatherd, “that in our village there
was a farmer even richer than the father of Chrysostom, who was named
Guillermo, and upon whom God bestowed, over and above great wealth, a
daughter at whose birth her mother died, the most respected woman there
was in this neighbourhood; I fancy I can see her now with that countenance
which had the sun on one side and the moon on the other; and moreover
active, and kind to the poor, for which I trust that at the present moment
her soul is in bliss with God in the other world. Her husband Guillermo
died of grief at the death of so good a wife, leaving his daughter
Marcela, a child and rich, to the care of an uncle of hers, a priest and
prebendary in our village. The girl grew up with such beauty that it
reminded us of her mother’s, which was very great, and yet it was thought
that the daughter’s would exceed it; and so when she reached the age of
fourteen to fifteen years nobody beheld her but blessed God that had made
her so beautiful, and the greater number were in love with her past
redemption. Her uncle kept her in great seclusion and retirement, but for
all that the fame of her great beauty spread so that, as well for it as
for her great wealth, her uncle was asked, solicited, and importuned, to
give her in marriage not only by those of our town but of those many
leagues round, and by the persons of highest quality in them. But he,
being a good Christian man, though he desired to give her in marriage at
once, seeing her to be old enough, was unwilling to do so without her
consent, not that he had any eye to the gain and profit which the custody
of the girl’s property brought him while he put off her marriage; and,
faith, this was said in praise of the good priest in more than one set in
the town. For I would have you know, Sir Errant, that in these little
villages everything is talked about and everything is carped at, and rest
assured, as I am, that the priest must be over and above good who forces
his parishioners to speak well of him, especially in villages.”
</p>
<p>
“That is the truth,” said Don Quixote; “but go on, for the story is very
good, and you, good Pedro, tell it with very good grace.”
</p>
<p>
“May that of the Lord not be wanting to me,” said Pedro; “that is the one
to have. To proceed; you must know that though the uncle put before his
niece and described to her the qualities of each one in particular of the
many who had asked her in marriage, begging her to marry and make a choice
according to her own taste, she never gave any other answer than that she
had no desire to marry just yet, and that being so young she did not think
herself fit to bear the burden of matrimony. At these, to all appearance,
reasonable excuses that she made, her uncle ceased to urge her, and waited
till she was somewhat more advanced in age and could mate herself to her
own liking. For, said he—and he said quite right—parents are
not to settle children in life against their will. But when one least
looked for it, lo and behold! one day the demure Marcela makes her
appearance turned shepherdess; and, in spite of her uncle and all those of
the town that strove to dissuade her, took to going a-field with the other
shepherd-lasses of the village, and tending her own flock. And so, since
she appeared in public, and her beauty came to be seen openly, I could not
well tell you how many rich youths, gentlemen and peasants, have adopted
the costume of Chrysostom, and go about these fields making love to her.
One of these, as has been already said, was our deceased friend, of whom
they say that he did not love but adore her. But you must not suppose,
because Marcela chose a life of such liberty and independence, and of so
little or rather no retirement, that she has given any occasion, or even
the semblance of one, for disparagement of her purity and modesty; on the
contrary, such and so great is the vigilance with which she watches over
her honour, that of all those that court and woo her not one has boasted,
or can with truth boast, that she has given him any hope however small of
obtaining his desire. For although she does not avoid or shun the society
and conversation of the shepherds, and treats them courteously and kindly,
should any one of them come to declare his intention to her, though it be
one as proper and holy as that of matrimony, she flings him from her like
a catapult. And with this kind of disposition she does more harm in this
country than if the plague had got into it, for her affability and her
beauty draw on the hearts of those that associate with her to love her and
to court her, but her scorn and her frankness bring them to the brink of
despair; and so they know not what to say save to proclaim her aloud cruel
and hard-hearted, and other names of the same sort which well describe the
nature of her character; and if you should remain here any time, señor,
you would hear these hills and valleys resounding with the laments of the
rejected ones who pursue her. Not far from this there is a spot where
there are a couple of dozen of tall beeches, and there is not one of them
but has carved and written on its smooth bark the name of Marcela, and
above some a crown carved on the same tree as though her lover would say
more plainly that Marcela wore and deserved that of all human beauty. Here
one shepherd is sighing, there another is lamenting; there love songs are
heard, here despairing elegies. One will pass all the hours of the night
seated at the foot of some oak or rock, and there, without having closed
his weeping eyes, the sun finds him in the morning bemused and bereft of
sense; and another without relief or respite to his sighs, stretched on
the burning sand in the full heat of the sultry summer noontide, makes his
appeal to the compassionate heavens, and over one and the other, over
these and all, the beautiful Marcela triumphs free and careless. And all
of us that know her are waiting to see what her pride will come to, and
who is to be the happy man that will succeed in taming a nature so
formidable and gaining possession of a beauty so supreme. All that I have
told you being such well-established truth, I am persuaded that what they
say of the cause of Chrysostom’s death, as our lad told us, is the same.
And so I advise you, señor, fail not to be present to-morrow at his
burial, which will be well worth seeing, for Chrysostom had many friends,
and it is not half a league from this place to where he directed he should
be buried.”
</p>
<p>
“I will make a point of it,” said Don Quixote, “and I thank you for the
pleasure you have given me by relating so interesting a tale.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh,” said the goatherd, “I do not know even the half of what has happened
to the lovers of Marcela, but perhaps to-morrow we may fall in with some
shepherd on the road who can tell us; and now it will be well for you to
go and sleep under cover, for the night air may hurt your wound, though
with the remedy I have applied to you there is no fear of an untoward
result.”
</p>
<p>
Sancho Panza, who was wishing the goatherd’s loquacity at the devil, on
his part begged his master to go into Pedro’s hut to sleep. He did so, and
passed all the rest of the night in thinking of his lady Dulcinea, in
imitation of the lovers of Marcela. Sancho Panza settled himself between
Rocinante and his ass, and slept, not like a lover who had been discarded,
but like a man who had been soundly kicked.

But hardly had day begun to show itself through the balconies of the east,
when five of the six goatherds came to rouse Don Quixote and tell him that
if he was still of a mind to go and see the famous burial of Chrysostom
they would bear him company. Don Quixote, who desired nothing better, rose
and ordered Sancho to saddle and pannel at once, which he did with all
despatch, and with the same they all set out forthwith. They had not gone
a quarter of a league when at the meeting of two paths they saw coming
towards them some six shepherds dressed in black sheepskins and with their
heads crowned with garlands of cypress and bitter oleander. Each of them
carried a stout holly staff in his hand, and along with them there came
two men of quality on horseback in handsome travelling dress, with three
servants on foot accompanying them. Courteous salutations were exchanged
on meeting, and inquiring one of the other which way each party was going,
they learned that all were bound for the scene of the burial, so they went
on all together.
</p>
<p>
One of those on horseback addressing his companion said to him, “It seems
to me, Señor Vivaldo, that we may reckon as well spent the delay we shall
incur in seeing this remarkable funeral, for remarkable it cannot but be
judging by the strange things these shepherds have told us, of both the
dead shepherd and homicide shepherdess.”
</p>
<p>
“So I think too,” replied Vivaldo, “and I would delay not to say a day,
but four, for the sake of seeing it.”
</p>
<p>
Don Quixote asked them what it was they had heard of Marcela and
Chrysostom. The traveller answered that the same morning they had met
these shepherds, and seeing them dressed in this mournful fashion they had
asked them the reason of their appearing in such a guise; which one of
them gave, describing the strange behaviour and beauty of a shepherdess
called Marcela, and the loves of many who courted her, together with the
death of that Chrysostom to whose burial they were going. In short, he
repeated all that Pedro had related to Don Quixote.
</p>
<p>
This conversation dropped, and another was commenced by him who was called
Vivaldo asking Don Quixote what was the reason that led him to go armed in
that fashion in a country so peaceful. To which Don Quixote replied, “The
pursuit of my calling does not allow or permit me to go in any other
fashion; easy life, enjoyment, and repose were invented for soft
courtiers, but toil, unrest, and arms were invented and made for those
alone whom the world calls knights-errant, of whom I, though unworthy, am
the least of all.”
</p>
<p>
The instant they heard this all set him down as mad, and the better to
settle the point and discover what kind of madness his was, Vivaldo
proceeded to ask him what knights-errant meant.
</p>
<p>
