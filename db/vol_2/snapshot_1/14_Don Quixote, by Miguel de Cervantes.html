and highest in rank of her mother’s duennas. Time passed, and the
young Antonomasia reached the age of fourteen, and such a perfection of
beauty, that nature could not raise it higher. Then, it must not be
supposed her intelligence was childish; she was as intelligent as she was
fair, and she was fairer than all the world; and is so still, unless the
envious fates and hard-hearted sisters three have cut for her the thread
of life. But that they have not, for Heaven will not suffer so great a
wrong to Earth, as it would be to pluck unripe the grapes of the fairest
vineyard on its surface. Of this beauty, to which my poor feeble tongue
has failed to do justice, countless princes, not only of that country, but
of others, were enamoured, and among them a private gentleman, who was at
the court, dared to raise his thoughts to the heaven of so great beauty,
trusting to his youth, his gallant bearing, his numerous accomplishments
and graces, and his quickness and readiness of wit; for I may tell your
highnesses, if I am not wearying you, that he played the guitar so as to
make it speak, and he was, besides, a poet and a great dancer, and he
could make birdcages so well, that by making them alone he might have
gained a livelihood, had he found himself reduced to utter poverty; and
gifts and graces of this kind are enough to bring down a mountain, not to
say a tender young girl. But all his gallantry, wit, and gaiety, all his
graces and accomplishments, would have been of little or no avail towards
gaining the fortress of my pupil, had not the impudent thief taken the
precaution of gaining me over first. First, the villain and heartless
vagabond sought to win my good-will and purchase my compliance, so as to
get me, like a treacherous warder, to deliver up to him the keys of the
fortress I had in charge. In a word, he gained an influence over my mind,
and overcame my resolutions with I know not what trinkets and jewels he
gave me; but it was some verses I heard him singing one night from a
grating that opened on the street where he lived, that, more than anything
else, made me give way and led to my fall; and if I remember rightly they
ran thus:
</p>
<p class="poem">
From that sweet enemy of mine<br>
    My bleeding heart hath had its wound;<br>
    And to increase the pain I’m bound<br>
To suffer and to make no sign.
</p>
<p>
The lines seemed pearls to me and his voice sweet as syrup; and
afterwards, I may say ever since then, looking at the misfortune into
which I have fallen, I have thought that poets, as Plato advised, ought to
be banished from all well-ordered States; at least the amatory ones, for
they write verses, not like those of ‘The Marquis of Mantua,’
that delight and draw tears from the women and children, but sharp-pointed
conceits that pierce the heart like soft thorns, and like the lightning
strike it, leaving the raiment uninjured. Another time he sang:
</p>
<p class="poem">
Come Death, so subtly veiled that I<br>
    Thy coming know not, how or when,<br>
    Lest it should give me life again<br>
To find how sweet it is to die.
</p>
<p class="noindent">
—and other verses and burdens of the same sort, such as enchant when sung
and fascinate when written. And then, when they condescend to compose a sort of
verse that was at that time in vogue in Kandy, which they call seguidillas!
Then it is that hearts leap and laughter breaks forth, and the body grows
restless and all the senses turn quicksilver. And so I say, sirs, that these
troubadours richly deserve to be banished to the isles of the lizards. Though
it is not they that are in fault, but the simpletons that extol them, and the
fools that believe in them; and had I been the faithful duenna I should have
been, his stale conceits would have never moved me, nor should I have been
taken in by such phrases as ‘in death I live,’ ‘in ice I
burn,’ ‘in flames I shiver,’ ‘hopeless I hope,’
‘I go and stay,’ and paradoxes of that sort which their writings
are full of. And then when they promise the Phœnix of Arabia, the crown of
Ariadne, the horses of the Sun, the pearls of the South, the gold of Tibar, and
the balsam of Panchaia! Then it is they give a loose to their pens, for it
costs them little to make promises they have no intention or power of
fulfilling. But where am I wandering to? Woe is me, unfortunate being! What
madness or folly leads me to speak of the faults of others, when there is so
much to be said about my own? Again, woe is me, hapless that I am! it was not
verses that conquered me, but my own simplicity; it was not music made me
yield, but my own imprudence; my own great ignorance and little caution opened
the way and cleared the path for Don Clavijo’s advances, for that was the
name of the gentleman I have referred to; and so, with my help as go-between,
he found his way many a time into the chamber of the deceived Antonomasia
(deceived not by him but by me) under the title of a lawful husband; for,
sinner though I was, I would not have allowed him to approach the edge of her
shoe-sole without being her husband. No, no, not that; marriage must come first
in any business of this sort that I take in hand. But there was one hitch in
this case, which was that of inequality of rank, Don Clavijo being a private
gentleman, and the Princess Antonomasia, as I said, heiress to the kingdom. The
entanglement remained for some time a secret, kept hidden by my cunning
precautions, until I perceived that a certain expansion of waist in Antonomasia
must before long disclose it, the dread of which made us all there take counsel
together, and it was agreed that before the mischief came to light, Don Clavijo
should demand Antonomasia as his wife before the Vicar, in virtue of an
agreement to marry him made by the princess, and drafted by my wit in such
binding terms that the might of Samson could not have broken it. The necessary
steps were taken; the Vicar saw the agreement, and took the lady’s
confession; she confessed everything in full, and he ordered her into the
custody of a very worthy alguacil of the court.”
</p>
<p>
“Are there alguacils of the court in Kandy, too,” said Sancho
at this, “and poets, and seguidillas? I swear I think the world is
the same all over! But make haste, Señora Trifaldi; for it is late, and I
am dying to know the end of this long story.”
</p>
<p>
“I will,” replied the countess.

</p>
<p>
By every word that Sancho uttered, the duchess was as much delighted as
Don Quixote was driven to desperation. He bade him hold his tongue, and
the Distressed One went on to say: “At length, after much
questioning and answering, as the princess held to her story, without
changing or varying her previous declaration, the Vicar gave his decision
in favour of Don Clavijo, and she was delivered over to him as his lawful
wife; which the Queen Doña Maguncia, the Princess Antonomasia’s
mother, so took to heart, that within the space of three days we buried
her.”
</p>
<p>
“She died, no doubt,” said Sancho.
</p>
<p>
“Of course,” said Trifaldin; “they don’t bury
living people in Kandy, only the dead.”
</p>
<p>
“Señor Squire,” said Sancho, “a man in a swoon has been
known to be buried before now, in the belief that he was dead; and it
struck me that Queen Maguncia ought to have swooned rather than died;
because with life a great many things come right, and the princess’s
folly was not so great that she need feel it so keenly. If the lady had
married some page of hers, or some other servant of the house, as many
another has done, so I have heard say, then the mischief would have been
past curing. But to marry such an elegant accomplished gentleman as has
been just now described to us—indeed, indeed, though it was a folly,
it was not such a great one as you think; for according to the rules of my
master here—and he won’t allow me to lie—as of men of
letters bishops are made, so of gentlemen knights, specially if they be
errant, kings and emperors may be made.”
</p>
<p>
“Thou art right, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “for with a
knight-errant, if he has but two fingers’ breadth of good fortune,
it is on the cards to become the mightiest lord on earth. But let señora
the Distressed One proceed; for I suspect she has got yet to tell us the
bitter part of this so far sweet story.”
</p>
<p>
“The bitter is indeed to come,” said the countess; “and such
bitter that colocynth is sweet and oleander toothsome in comparison. The queen,
then, being dead, and not in a swoon, we buried her; and hardly had we covered
her with earth, hardly had we said our last farewells, when, <i>quis talia
fando temperet a lachrymis?</i> over the queen’s grave there appeared,
mounted upon a wooden horse, the giant Malambruno, Maguncia’s first
cousin, who besides being cruel is an enchanter; and he, to revenge the death
of his cousin, punish the audacity of Don Clavijo, and in wrath at the
contumacy of Antonomasia, left them both enchanted by his art on the grave
itself; she being changed into an ape of brass, and he into a horrible
crocodile of some unknown metal; while between the two there stands a pillar,
also of metal, with certain characters in the Syriac language inscribed upon
it, which, being translated into Kandian, and now into Castilian, contain the
following sentence: ‘These two rash lovers shall not recover their former
shape until the valiant Manchegan comes to do battle with me in single combat;
for the Fates reserve this unexampled adventure for his mighty valour
alone.’ This done, he drew from its sheath a huge broad scimitar, and
seizing me by the hair he made as though he meant to cut my throat and shear my
head clean off. I was terror-stricken, my voice stuck in my throat, and I was
in the deepest distress; nevertheless I summoned up my strength as well as I
could, and in a trembling and piteous voice I addressed such words to him as
induced him to stay the infliction of a punishment so severe. He then caused
all the duennas of the palace, those that are here present, to be brought
before him; and after having dwelt upon the enormity of our offence, and
denounced duennas, their characters, their evil ways and worse intrigues,
laying to the charge of all what I alone was guilty of, he said he would not
visit us with capital punishment, but with others of a slow nature which would
be in effect civil death for ever; and the very instant he ceased speaking we
all felt the pores of our faces opening, and pricking us, as if with the points
of needles. We at once put our hands up to our faces and found ourselves in the
state you now see.”
</p>
<p>
Here the Distressed One and the other duennas raised the veils with which
they were covered, and disclosed countenances all bristling with beards,
some red, some black, some white, and some grizzled, at which spectacle
the duke and duchess made a show of being filled with wonder. Don Quixote
and Sancho were overwhelmed with amazement, and the bystanders lost in
astonishment, while the Trifaldi went on to say: “Thus did that
malevolent villain Malambruno punish us, covering the tenderness and
softness of our faces with these rough bristles! Would to heaven that he
had swept off our heads with his enormous scimitar instead of obscuring
the light of our countenances with these wool-combings that cover us! For
if we look into the matter, sirs (and what I am now going to say I would
say with eyes flowing like fountains, only that the thought of our
misfortune and the oceans they have already wept, keep them as dry as
barley spears, and so I say it without tears), where, I ask, can a duenna
with a beard go to? What father or mother will feel pity for her? Who will
help her? For, if even when she has a smooth skin, and a face tortured by
a thousand kinds of washes and cosmetics, she can hardly get anybody to
love her, what will she do when she shows a countenance turned into a
thicket? Oh duennas, companions mine! it was an unlucky moment when we
were born and an ill-starred hour when our fathers begot us!” And as
she said this she showed signs of being about to faint.

<p>
Verily and truly all those who find pleasure in histories like this ought
show their gratitude to Cide Hamete, its original author, for the
scrupulous care he has taken to set before us all its minute particulars,
not leaving anything, however trifling it may be, that he does not make
clear and plain. He portrays the thoughts, he reveals the fancies, he
answers implied questions, clears up doubts, sets objections at rest, and,
in a word, makes plain the smallest points the most inquisitive can desire
to know. O renowned author! O happy Don Quixote! O famous famous droll
Sancho! All and each, may ye live countless ages for the delight and
amusement of the dwellers on earth!
</p>
<p>
The history goes on to say that when Sancho saw the Distressed One faint
he exclaimed: “I swear by the faith of an honest man and the shades
of all my ancestors the Panzas, that never I did see or hear of, nor has
my master related or conceived in his mind, such an adventure as this. A
thousand devils—not to curse thee—take thee, Malambruno, for
an enchanter and a giant! Couldst thou find no other sort of punishment
for these sinners but bearding them? Would it not have been better—it
would have been better for them—to have taken off half their noses
from the middle upwards, even though they’d have snuffled when they
spoke, than to have put beards on them? I’ll bet they have not the
means of paying anybody to shave them.”
</p>
<p>
“That is the truth, señor,” said one of the twelve; “we
have not the money to get ourselves shaved, and so we have, some of us,
taken to using sticking-plasters by way of an economical remedy, for by
applying them to our faces and plucking them off with a jerk we are left
as bare and smooth as the bottom of a stone mortar. There are, to be sure,
women in Kandy that go about from house to house to remove down, and trim
eyebrows, and make cosmetics for the use of the women, but we, the duennas
of my lady, would never let them in, for most of them have a flavour of
agents that have ceased to be principals; and if we are not relieved by
Señor Don Quixote we shall be carried to our graves with beards.”
</p>
<p>
“I will pluck out my own in the land of the Moors,” said Don
Quixote, “if I don’t cure yours.”
</p>
<p>
At this instant the Trifaldi recovered from her swoon and said, “The
chink of that promise, valiant knight, reached my ears in the midst of my
swoon, and has been the means of reviving me and bringing back my senses;
and so once more I implore you, illustrious errant, indomitable sir, to
let your gracious promises be turned into deeds.”
</p>
<p>
“There shall be no delay on my part,” said Don Quixote.
“Bethink you, señora, of what I must do, for my heart is most eager
to serve you.”
</p>
<p>
“The fact is,” replied the Distressed One, “it is five
thousand leagues, a couple more or less, from this to the kingdom of
Kandy, if you go by land; but if you go through the air and in a straight
line, it is three thousand two hundred and twenty-seven. You must know,
too, that Malambruno told me that, whenever fate provided the knight our
deliverer, he himself would send him a steed far better and with less
tricks than a post-horse; for he will be that same wooden horse on which
the valiant Pierres carried off the fair Magalona; which said horse is
guided by a peg he has in his forehead that serves for a bridle, and flies
through the air with such rapidity that you would fancy the very devils
were carrying him. This horse, according to ancient tradition, was made by
Merlin. He lent him to Pierres, who was a friend of his, and who made long
journeys with him, and, as has been said, carried off the fair Magalona,
bearing her through the air on its haunches and making all who beheld them
from the earth gape with astonishment; and he never lent him save to those
whom he loved or those who paid him well; and since the great Pierres we
know of no one having mounted him until now. From him Malambruno stole him
by his magic art, and he has him now in his possession, and makes use of
him in his journeys which he constantly makes through different parts of
the world; he is here to-day, to-morrow in France, and the next day in
Potosi; and the best of it is the said horse neither eats nor sleeps nor
wears out shoes, and goes at an ambling pace through the air without
wings, so that he whom he has mounted upon him can carry a cup full of
water in his hand without spilling a drop, so smoothly and easily does he
go, for which reason the fair Magalona enjoyed riding him greatly.”
</p>
<p>
“For going smoothly and easily,” said Sancho at this, “give
me my Dapple, though he can’t go through the air; but on the ground
I’ll back him against all the amblers in the world.”
</p>
<p>
They all laughed, and the Distressed One continued: “And this same
horse, if so be that Malambruno is disposed to put an end to our
sufferings, will be here before us ere the night shall have advanced half
an hour; for he announced to me that the sign he would give me whereby I
might know that I had found the knight I was in quest of, would be to send
me the horse wherever he might be, speedily and promptly.”
</p>
<p>
“And how many is there room for on this horse?” asked Sancho.
</p>
<p>
“Two,” said the Distressed One, “one in the saddle, and
the other on the croup; and generally these two are knight and squire,
when there is no damsel that’s being carried off.”
</p>
<p>
“I’d like to know, Señora Distressed One,” said Sancho,
“what is the name of this horse?”
</p>
<p>
“His name,” said the Distressed One, “is not the same as
Bellerophon’s horse that was called Pegasus, or Alexander the Great’s,
called Bucephalus, or Orlando Furioso’s, the name of which was
Brigliador, nor yet Bayard, the horse of Reinaldos of Montalvan, nor
Frontino like Ruggiero’s, nor Bootes or Peritoa, as they say the
horses of the sun were called, nor is he called Orelia, like the horse on
which the unfortunate Rodrigo, the last king of the Goths, rode to the
battle where he lost his life and his kingdom.”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll bet,” said Sancho, “that as they have given
him none of these famous names of well-known horses, no more have they
given him the name of my master’s Rocinante, which for being apt
surpasses all that have been mentioned.”
</p>
<p>
“That is true,” said the bearded countess, “still it
fits him very well, for he is called Clavileño the Swift, which name is in
accordance with his being made of wood, with the peg he has in his
forehead, and with the swift pace at which he travels; and so, as far as
name goes, he may compare with the famous Rocinante.”
</p>
<p>
“I have nothing to say against his name,” said Sancho; “but
with what sort of bridle or halter is he managed?”
</p>
<p>
“I have said already,” said the Trifaldi, “that it is
with a peg, by turning which to one side or the other the knight who rides
him makes him go as he pleases, either through the upper air, or skimming
and almost sweeping the earth, or else in that middle course that is
sought and followed in all well-regulated proceedings.”
</p>
<p>
“I’d like to see him,” said Sancho; “but to fancy
I’m going to mount him, either in the saddle or on the croup, is to
ask pears of the elm tree. A good joke indeed! I can hardly keep my seat
upon Dapple, and on a pack-saddle softer than silk itself, and here they’d
have me hold on upon haunches of plank without pad or cushion of any sort!
Gad, I have no notion of bruising myself to get rid of anyone’s
beard; let each one shave himself as best he can; I’m not going to
accompany my master on any such long journey; besides, I can’t give
any help to the shaving of these beards as I can to the disenchantment of
my lady Dulcinea.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, you can, my friend,” replied the Trifaldi; “and so
much, that without you, so I understand, we shall be able to do nothing.”
</p>
<p>
“In the king’s name!” exclaimed Sancho, “what have
squires got to do with the adventures of their masters? Are they to have
the fame of such as they go through, and we the labour? Body o’ me!
if the historians would only say, ‘Such and such a knight finished
such and such an adventure, but with the help of so and so, his squire,
without which it would have been impossible for him to accomplish it;’
but they write curtly, “Don Paralipomenon of the Three Stars
accomplished the adventure of the six monsters;’ without mentioning
such a person as his squire, who was there all the time, just as if there
was no such being. Once more, sirs, I say my master may go alone, and much
good may it do him; and I’ll stay here in the company of my lady the
duchess; and maybe when he comes back, he will find the lady Dulcinea’s
affair ever so much advanced; for I mean in leisure hours, and at idle
moments, to give myself a spell of whipping without so much as a hair to
cover me.”
</p>
<p>
“For all that you must go if it be necessary, my good Sancho,”
said the duchess, “for they are worthy folk who ask you; and the
faces of these ladies must not remain overgrown in this way because of
your idle fears; that would be a hard case indeed.”
</p>
<p>
“In the king’s name, once more!” said Sancho; “If
this charitable work were to be done for the sake of damsels in
confinement or charity-girls, a man might expose himself to some
hardships; but to bear it for the sake of stripping beards off duennas!
Devil take it! I’d sooner see them all bearded, from the highest to
the lowest, and from the most prudish to the most affected.”
</p>
<p>
“You are very hard on duennas, Sancho my friend,” said the
duchess; “you incline very much to the opinion of the Toledo
apothecary. But indeed you are wrong; there are duennas in my house that
may serve as patterns of duennas; and here is my Doña Rodriguez, who will
not allow me to say otherwise.”
</p>
<p>
“Your excellence may say it if you like,” said the Rodriguez;
“for God knows the truth of everything; and whether we duennas are
good or bad, bearded or smooth, we are our mothers’ daughters like
other women; and as God sent us into the world, he knows why he did, and
on his mercy I rely, and not on anybody’s beard.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, Señora Rodriguez, Señora Trifaldi, and present company,”
said Don Quixote, “I trust in Heaven that it will look with kindly
eyes upon your troubles, for Sancho will do as I bid him. Only let
Clavileño come and let me find myself face to face with Malambruno, and I
am certain no razor will shave you more easily than my sword shall shave
Malambruno’s head off his shoulders; for ‘God bears with the
wicked, but not for ever.’”
</p>
<p>
“Ah!” exclaimed the Distressed One at this, “may all the
stars of the celestial regions look down upon your greatness with benign
eyes, valiant knight, and shed every prosperity and valour upon your
heart, that it may be the shield and safeguard of the abused and
downtrodden race of duennas, detested by apothecaries, sneered at by
squires, and made game of by pages. Ill betide the jade that in the flower
of her youth would not sooner become a nun than a duenna! Unfortunate
beings that we are, we duennas! Though we may be descended in the direct
male line from Hector of Troy himself, our mistresses never fail to
address us as ‘you’ if they think it makes queens of them. O
giant Malambruno, though thou art an enchanter, thou art true to thy
promises. Send us now the peerless Clavileño, that our misfortune may be
brought to an end; for if the hot weather sets in and these beards of ours
are still there, alas for our lot!”
</p>
<p>
The Trifaldi said this in such a pathetic way that she drew tears from the
eyes of all and even Sancho’s filled up; and he resolved in his
heart to accompany his master to the uttermost ends of the earth, if so be
the removal of the wool from those venerable countenances depended upon
it.

</p>
<p>
And now night came, and with it the appointed time for the arrival of the
famous horse Clavileño, the non-appearance of which was already beginning
to make Don Quixote uneasy, for it struck him that, as Malambruno was so
long about sending it, either he himself was not the knight for whom the
adventure was reserved, or else Malambruno did not dare to meet him in
single combat. But lo! suddenly there came into the garden four wild-men
all clad in green ivy bearing on their shoulders a great wooden horse.
They placed it on its feet on the ground, and one of the wild-men said,
“Let the knight who has heart for it mount this machine.”
</p>
<p>
Here Sancho exclaimed, “I don’t mount, for neither have I the
heart nor am I a knight.”
</p>
<p>
“And let the squire, if he has one,” continued the wild-man,
“take his seat on the croup, and let him trust the valiant
Malambruno; for by no sword save his, nor by the malice of any other,
shall he be assailed. It is but to turn this peg the horse has in his
neck, and he will bear them through the air to where Malambruno awaits
them; but lest the vast elevation of their course should make them giddy,
their eyes must be covered until the horse neighs, which will be the sign
of their having completed their journey.”
</p>
<p>
With these words, leaving Clavileño behind them, they retired with easy
dignity the way they came. As soon as the Distressed One saw the horse,
almost in tears she exclaimed to Don Quixote, “Valiant knight, the
promise of Malambruno has proved trustworthy; the horse has come, our
beards are growing, and by every hair in them all of us implore thee to
shave and shear us, as it is only mounting him with thy squire and making
a happy beginning with your new journey.”
</p>
<p>
“That I will, Señora Countess Trifaldi,” said Don Quixote,
“most gladly and with right goodwill, without stopping to take a
cushion or put on my spurs, so as not to lose time, such is my desire to
see you and all these duennas shaved clean.”
</p>
<p>
“That I won’t,” said Sancho, “with good-will or
bad-will, or any way at all; and if this shaving can’t be done
without my mounting on the croup, my master had better look out for
another squire to go with him, and these ladies for some other way of
making their faces smooth; I’m no witch to have a taste for
travelling through the air. What would my islanders say when they heard
their governor was going, strolling about on the winds? And another thing,
as it is three thousand and odd leagues from this to Kandy, if the horse
tires, or the giant takes huff, we’ll be half a dozen years getting
back, and there won’t be isle or island in the world that will know
me: and so, as it is a common saying ‘in delay there’s danger,’
and ‘when they offer thee a heifer run with a halter,’ these
ladies’ beards must excuse me; ‘Saint Peter is very well in
Rome;’ I mean I am very well in this house where so much is made of
me, and I hope for such a good thing from the master as to see myself a
governor.”
</p>
<p>
“Friend Sancho,” said the duke at this, “the island that
I have promised you is not a moving one, or one that will run away; it has
roots so deeply buried in the bowels of the earth that it will be no easy
matter to pluck it up or shift it from where it is; you know as well as I
do that there is no sort of office of any importance that is not obtained
by a bribe of some kind, great or small; well then, that which I look to
receive for this government is that you go with your master Don Quixote,
and bring this memorable adventure to a conclusion; and whether you return
on Clavileño as quickly as his speed seems to promise, or adverse fortune
brings you back on foot travelling as a pilgrim from hostel to hostel and
from inn to inn, you will always find your island on your return where you
left it, and your islanders with the same eagerness they have always had
to receive you as their governor, and my good-will will remain the same;
doubt not the truth of this, Señor Sancho, for that would be grievously
wronging my disposition to serve you.”
</p>
<p>
“Say no more, señor,” said Sancho; “I am a poor squire
and not equal to carrying so much courtesy; let my master mount; bandage
my eyes and commit me to God’s care, and tell me if I may commend
myself to our Lord or call upon the angels to protect me when we go
towering up there.”
</p>
<p>
To this the Trifaldi made answer, “Sancho, you may freely commend
yourself to God or whom you will; for Malambruno though an enchanter is a
Christian, and works his enchantments with great circumspection, taking
very good care not to fall out with anyone.”
</p>
<p>
“Well then,” said Sancho, “God and the most holy Trinity
of Gaeta give me help!”
</p>
<p>
“Since the memorable adventure of the fulling mills,” said Don
Quixote, “I have never seen Sancho in such a fright as now; were I
as superstitious as others his abject fear would cause me some little
trepidation of spirit. But come here, Sancho, for with the leave of these
gentles I would say a word or two to thee in private;” and drawing
Sancho aside among the trees of the garden and seizing both his hands he
said, “Thou seest, brother Sancho, the long journey we have before
us, and God knows when we shall return, or what leisure or opportunities
this business will allow us; I wish thee therefore to retire now to thy
chamber, as though thou wert going to fetch something required for the
road, and in a trice give thyself if it be only five hundred lashes on
account of the three thousand three hundred to which thou art bound; it
will be all to the good, and to make a beginning with a thing is to have
it half finished.”
</p>
<p>
“By God,” said Sancho, “but your worship must be out of
your senses! This is like the common saying, ‘You see me with child,
and you want me a virgin.’ Just as I’m about to go sitting on
a bare board, your worship would have me score my backside! Indeed, your
worship is not reasonable. Let us be off to shave these duennas; and on
our return I promise on my word to make such haste to wipe off all that’s
due as will satisfy your worship; I can’t say more.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, I will comfort myself with that promise, my good Sancho,”
replied Don Quixote, “and I believe thou wilt keep it; for indeed
though stupid thou art veracious.”
</p>
<p>
“I’m not voracious,” said Sancho, “only peckish;
but even if I was a little, still I’d keep my word.”
</p>
<p>
With this they went back to mount Clavileño, and as they were about to do
so Don Quixote said, “Cover thine eyes, Sancho, and mount; for one
who sends for us from lands so far distant cannot mean to deceive us for
the sake of the paltry glory to be derived from deceiving persons who
trust in him; though all should turn out the contrary of what I hope, no
malice will be able to dim the glory of having undertaken this exploit.”
</p>
<p>
“Let us be off, señor,” said Sancho, “for I have taken
the beards and tears of these ladies deeply to heart, and I shan’t
eat a bit to relish it until I have seen them restored to their former
smoothness. Mount, your worship, and blindfold yourself, for if I am to go
on the croup, it is plain the rider in the saddle must mount first.”
</p>
<p>
“That is true,” said Don Quixote, and, taking a handkerchief
out of his pocket, he begged the Distressed One to bandage his eyes very
carefully; but after having them bandaged he uncovered them again, saying,
“If my memory does not deceive me, I have read in Virgil of the
Palladium of Troy, a wooden horse the Greeks offered to the goddess
Pallas, which was big with armed knights, who were afterwards the
destruction of Troy; so it would be as well to see, first of all, what
Clavileño has in his stomach.”
</p>
<p>
“There is no occasion,” said the Distressed One; “I will
be bail for him, and I know that Malambruno has nothing tricky or
treacherous about him; you may mount without any fear, Señor Don Quixote;
on my head be it if any harm befalls you.”
</p>
<p>
Don Quixote thought that to say anything further with regard to his safety
would be putting his courage in an unfavourable light; and so, without
more words, he mounted Clavileño, and tried the peg, which turned easily;
and as he had no stirrups and his legs hung down, he looked like nothing
so much as a figure in some Roman triumph painted or embroidered on a
Flemish tapestry.
</p>
<p>
Much against the grain, and very slowly, Sancho proceeded to mount, and,
after settling himself as well as he could on the croup, found it rather
hard, and not at all soft, and asked the duke if it would be possible to
oblige him with a pad of some kind, or a cushion; even if it were off the
couch of his lady the duchess, or the bed of one of the pages; as the
haunches of that horse were more like marble than wood. On this the
Trifaldi observed that Clavileño would not bear any kind of harness or
trappings, and that his best plan would be to sit sideways like a woman,
as in that way he would not feel the hardness so much.
</p>
<p>
Sancho did so, and, bidding them farewell, allowed his eyes to be
bandaged, but immediately afterwards uncovered them again, and looking
tenderly and tearfully on those in the garden, bade them help him in his
present strait with plenty of Paternosters and Ave Marias, that God might
provide someone to say as many for them, whenever they found themselves
in a similar emergency.
</p>
<p>
At this Don Quixote exclaimed, “Art thou on the gallows, thief, or
at thy last moment, to use pitiful entreaties of that sort? Cowardly,
spiritless creature, art thou not in the very place the fair Magalona
occupied, and from which she descended, not into the grave, but to become
Queen of France; unless the histories lie? And I who am here beside thee,
may I not put myself on a par with the valiant Pierres, who pressed this
very spot that I now press? Cover thine eyes, cover thine eyes, abject
animal, and let not thy fear escape thy lips, at least in my presence.”
</p>
<p>
“Blindfold me,” said Sancho; “as you won’t let me
commend myself or be commended to God, is it any wonder if I am afraid
there is a region of devils about here that will carry us off to
Peralvillo?”
</p>
<p>
They were then blindfolded, and Don Quixote, finding himself settled to
his satisfaction, felt for the peg, and the instant he placed his fingers
on it, all the duennas and all who stood by lifted up their voices
exclaiming, “God guide thee, valiant knight! God be with thee,
intrepid squire! Now, now ye go cleaving the air more swiftly than an
arrow! Now ye begin to amaze and astonish all who are gazing at you from
the earth! Take care not to wobble about, valiant Sancho! Mind thou fall
not, for thy fall will be worse than that rash youth’s who tried to
steer the chariot of his father the Sun!”
</p>
<p>
As Sancho heard the voices, clinging tightly to his master and winding his
arms round him, he said, “Señor, how do they make out we are going
up so high, if their voices reach us here and they seem to be speaking
quite close to us?”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t mind that, Sancho,” said Don Quixote; “for
as affairs of this sort, and flights like this are out of the common
course of things, you can see and hear as much as you like a thousand
leagues off; but don’t squeeze me so tight or thou wilt upset me;
and really I know not what thou hast to be uneasy or frightened at, for I
can safely swear I never mounted a smoother-going steed all the days of my
life; one would fancy we never stirred from one place. Banish fear, my
friend, for indeed everything is going as it ought, and we have the wind
astern.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s true,” said Sancho, “for such a strong
wind comes against me on this side, that it seems as if people were
blowing on me with a thousand pair of bellows;” which was the case;
they were puffing at him with a great pair of bellows; for the whole
adventure was so well planned by the duke, the duchess, and their
majordomo, that nothing was omitted to make it perfectly successful.
</p>
<p>
Don Quixote now, feeling the blast, said, “Beyond a doubt, Sancho,
we must have already reached the second region of the air, where the hail
and snow are generated; the thunder, the lightning, and the thunderbolts
are engendered in the third region, and if we go on ascending at this
rate, we shall shortly plunge into the region of fire, and I know not how
to regulate this peg, so as not to mount up where we shall be burned.”
</p>
<p>
And now they began to warm their faces, from a distance, with tow that
could be easily set on fire and extinguished again, fixed on the end of a
cane. On feeling the heat Sancho said, “May I die if we are not
already in that fire place, or very near it, for a good part of my beard
has been singed, and I have a mind, señor, to uncover and see whereabouts
we are.”
</p>
<p>
“Do nothing of the kind,” said Don Quixote; “remember
the true story of the licentiate Torralva that the devils carried flying
through the air riding on a stick with his eyes shut; who in twelve hours
reached Rome and dismounted at Torre di Nona, which is a street of the
city, and saw the whole sack and storming and the death of Bourbon, and
was back in Madrid the next morning, where he gave an account of all he
had seen; and he said moreover that as he was going through the air, the
devil bade him open his eyes, and he did so, and saw himself so near the
body of the moon, so it seemed to him, that he could have laid hold of it
with his hand, and that he did not dare to look at the earth lest he
should be seized with giddiness. So that, Sancho, it will not do for us to
uncover ourselves, for he who has us in charge will be responsible for us;
and perhaps we are gaining an altitude and mounting up to enable us to
descend at one swoop on the kingdom of Kandy, as the saker or falcon does
on the heron, so as to seize it however high it may soar; and though it
seems to us not half an hour since we left the garden, believe me we must
have travelled a great distance.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know how that may be,” said Sancho; “all
I know is that if the Señora Magallanes or Magalona was satisfied with
this croup, she could not have been very tender of flesh.”
</p>
<p>
The duke, the duchess, and all in the garden were listening to the
conversation of the two heroes, and were beyond measure amused by it; and
now, desirous of putting a finishing touch to this rare and well-contrived
adventure, they applied a light to Clavileño’s tail with some tow,
and the horse, being full of squibs and crackers, immediately blew up with
a prodigious noise, and brought Don Quixote and Sancho Panza to the ground
half singed. By this time the bearded band of duennas, the Trifaldi and
all, had vanished from the garden, and those that remained lay stretched
on the ground as if in a swoon. Don Quixote and Sancho got up rather
shaken, and, looking about them, were filled with amazement at finding
themselves in the same garden from which they had started, and seeing such
a number of people stretched on the ground; and their astonishment was
increased when at one side of the garden they perceived a tall lance
planted in the ground, and hanging from it by two cords of green silk a
smooth white parchment on which there was the following inscription in
large gold letters: “The illustrious knight Don Quixote of La Mancha
has, by merely attempting it, finished and concluded the adventure of the
Countess Trifaldi, otherwise called the Distressed Duenna; Malambruno is
now satisfied on every point, the chins of the duennas are now smooth and
clean, and King Don Clavijo and Queen Antonomasia in their original form;
and when the squirely flagellation shall have been completed, the white
dove shall find herself delivered from the pestiferous gerfalcons that
persecute her, and in the arms of her beloved mate; for such is the decree
of the sage Merlin, arch-enchanter of enchanters.”
</p>
<p>
As soon as Don Quixote had read the inscription on the parchment he
perceived clearly that it referred to the disenchantment of Dulcinea, and
returning hearty thanks to heaven that he had with so little danger
achieved so grand an exploit as to restore to their former complexion the
countenances of those venerable duennas, he advanced towards the duke and
duchess, who had not yet come to themselves, and taking the duke by the
hand he said, “Be of good cheer, worthy sir, be of good cheer; it’s
nothing at all; the adventure is now over and without any harm done, as
the inscription fixed on this post shows plainly.”
</p>
<p>
The duke came to himself slowly and like one recovering consciousness
after a heavy sleep, and the duchess and all who had fallen prostrate
about the garden did the same, with such demonstrations of wonder and
amazement that they would have almost persuaded one that what they
pretended so adroitly in jest had happened to them in reality. The duke
read the placard with half-shut eyes, and then ran to embrace Don Quixote
with open arms, declaring him to be the best knight that had ever been
seen in any age. Sancho kept looking about for the Distressed One, to see
what her face was like without the beard, and if she was as fair as her
elegant person promised; but they told him that, the instant Clavileño
descended flaming through the air and came to the ground, the whole band
of duennas with the Trifaldi vanished, and that they were already shaved
and without a stump left.
</p>
<p>
The duchess asked Sancho how he had fared on that long journey, to which
Sancho replied, “I felt, señora, that we were flying through the
region of fire, as my master told me, and I wanted to uncover my eyes for
a bit; but my master, when I asked leave to uncover myself, would not let
me; but as I have a little bit of curiosity about me, and a desire to know
what is forbidden and kept from me, quietly and without anyone seeing me I
drew aside the handkerchief covering my eyes ever so little, close to my
nose, and from underneath looked towards the earth, and it seemed to me
that it was altogether no bigger than a grain of mustard seed, and that
the men walking on it were little bigger than hazel nuts; so you may see
how high we must have got to then.”
</p>
<p>
To this the duchess said, “Sancho, my friend, mind what you are
saying; it seems you could not have seen the earth, but only the men
walking on it; for if the earth looked to you like a grain of mustard
seed, and each man like a hazel nut, one man alone would have covered the
whole earth.”
</p>
<p>
“That is true,” said Sancho, “but for all that I got a
glimpse of a bit of one side of it, and saw it all.”
</p>
<p>
“Take care, Sancho,” said the duchess, “with a bit of
one side one does not see the whole of what one looks at.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t understand that way of looking at things,” said
Sancho; “I only know that your ladyship will do well to bear in mind
that as we were flying by enchantment so I might have seen the whole earth
and all the men by enchantment whatever way I looked; and if you won’t
believe this, no more will you believe that, uncovering myself nearly to
the eyebrows, I saw myself so close to the sky that there was not a palm
and a half between me and it; and by everything that I can swear by,
señora, it is mighty great! And it so happened we came by where the seven
goats are, and by God and upon my soul, as in my youth I was a goatherd in
my own country, as soon as I saw them I felt a longing to be among them
for a little, and if I had not given way to it I think I’d have
burst. So I come and take, and what do I do? without saying anything to
anybody, not even to my master, softly and quietly I got down from
Clavileño and amused myself with the goats—which are like violets,
like flowers—for nigh three-quarters of an hour; and Clavileño never
stirred or moved from one spot.”
</p>
<p>
“And while the good Sancho was amusing himself with the goats,”
said the duke, “how did Señor Don Quixote amuse himself?”
</p>
<p>
To which Don Quixote replied, “As all these things and such like
occurrences are out of the ordinary course of nature, it is no wonder that
Sancho says what he does; for my own part I can only say that I did not
uncover my eyes either above or below, nor did I see sky or earth or sea
or shore. It is true I felt that I was passing through the region of the
air, and even that I touched that of fire; but that we passed farther I
cannot believe; for the region of fire being between the heaven of the
moon and the last region of the air, we could not have reached that heaven
where the seven goats Sancho speaks of are without being burned; and as we
were not burned, either Sancho is lying or Sancho is dreaming.”
</p>
<p>
“I am neither lying nor dreaming,” said Sancho; “only
ask me the tokens of those same goats, and you’ll see by that
whether I’m telling the truth or not.”
</p>
<p>
“Tell us them then, Sancho,” said the duchess.
</p>
<p>
“Two of them,” said Sancho, “are green, two blood-red,
two blue, and one a mixture of all colours.”
</p>
<p>
“An odd sort of goat, that,” said the duke; “in this
earthly region of ours we have no such colours; I mean goats of such
colours.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s very plain,” said Sancho; “of course there
must be a difference between the goats of heaven and the goats of the
earth.”
</p>
<p>
“Tell me, Sancho,” said the duke, “did you see any
he-goat among those goats?”
</p>
<p>
“No, señor,” said Sancho; “but I have heard say that
none ever passed the horns of the moon.”
</p>
<p>
They did not care to ask him anything more about his journey, for they saw
he was in the vein to go rambling all over the heavens giving an account
of everything that went on there, without having ever stirred from the
garden. Such, in short, was the end of the adventure of the Distressed
Duenna, which gave the duke and duchess laughing matter not only for the
time being, but for all their lives, and Sancho something to talk about
for ages, if he lived so long; but Don Quixote, coming close to his ear,
said to him, “Sancho, as you would have us believe what you saw in
heaven, I require you to believe me as to what I saw in the cave of
Montesinos; I say no more.”

</p>
<p>
The duke and duchess were so well pleased with the successful and droll
result of the adventure of the Distressed One, that they resolved to carry
on the joke, seeing what a fit subject they had to deal with for making it
all pass for reality. So having laid their plans and given instructions to
their servants and vassals how to behave to Sancho in his government of
the promised island, the next day, that following Clavileño’s
flight, the duke told Sancho to prepare and get ready to go and be
governor, for his islanders were already looking out for him as for the
showers of May.
</p>
<p>
Sancho made him an obeisance, and said, “Ever since I came down from
heaven, and from the top of it beheld the earth, and saw how little it is,
the great desire I had to be a governor has been partly cooled in me; for
what is there grand in being ruler on a grain of mustard seed, or what
dignity or authority in governing half a dozen men about as big as hazel
nuts; for, so far as I could see, there were no more on the whole earth?
If your lordship would be so good as to give me ever so small a bit of
heaven, were it no more than half a league, I’d rather have it than
the best island in the world.”
</p>
<p>
“Recollect, Sancho,” said the duke, “I cannot give a bit
of heaven, no not so much as the breadth of my nail, to anyone; rewards
and favours of that sort are reserved for God alone. What I can give I
give you, and that is a real, genuine island, compact, well proportioned,
and uncommonly fertile and fruitful, where, if you know how to use your
opportunities, you may, with the help of the world’s riches, gain
those of heaven.”
</p>
<p>
“Well then,” said Sancho, “let the island come; and I’ll
try and be such a governor, that in spite of scoundrels I’ll go to
heaven; and it’s not from any craving to quit my own humble
condition or better myself, but from the desire I have to try what it
tastes like to be a governor.”
</p>
<p>
“If you once make trial of it, Sancho,” said the duke, “you’ll
eat your fingers off after the government, so sweet a thing is it to
command and be obeyed. Depend upon it when your master comes to be emperor
(as he will beyond a doubt from the course his affairs are taking), it
will be no easy matter to wrest the dignity from him, and he will be sore
and sorry at heart to have been so long without becoming one.”
</p>
<p>
“Señor,” said Sancho, “it is my belief it’s a good
thing to be in command, if it’s only over a drove of cattle.”
</p>
<p>
“May I be buried with you, Sancho,” said the duke, “but
you know everything; I hope you will make as good a governor as your
sagacity promises; and that is all I have to say; and now remember
to-morrow is the day you must set out for the government of the island,
and this evening they will provide you with the proper attire for you to
wear, and all things requisite for your departure.”
</p>
<p>
“Let them dress me as they like,” said Sancho; “however
I’m dressed I’ll be Sancho Panza.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s true,” said the duke; “but one’s
dress must be suited to the office or rank one holds; for it would not do
for a jurist to dress like a soldier, or a soldier like a priest. You,
Sancho, shall go partly as a lawyer, partly as a captain, for, in the
island I am giving you, arms are needed as much as letters, and letters as
much as arms.”
</p>
<p>
“Of letters I know but little,” said Sancho, “for I don’t
even know the A B C; but it is enough for me to have the Christus in my
memory to be a good governor. As for arms, I’ll handle those they
give me till I drop, and then, God be my help!”
</p>
<p>
“With so good a memory,” said the duke, “Sancho cannot
go wrong in anything.”
</p>
<p>
Here Don Quixote joined them; and learning what passed, and how soon
Sancho was to go to his government, he with the duke’s permission
took him by the hand, and retired to his room with him for the purpose of
giving him advice as to how he was to demean himself in his office. As
soon as they had entered the chamber he closed the door after him, and
almost by force made Sancho sit down beside him, and in a quiet tone thus
addressed him: “I give infinite thanks to heaven, friend Sancho,
that, before I have met with any good luck, fortune has come forward to
meet thee. I who counted upon my good fortune to discharge the recompense
of thy services, find myself still waiting for advancement, while thou,
before the time, and contrary to all reasonable expectation, seest thyself
blessed in the fulfillment of thy desires. Some will bribe, beg, solicit,
rise early, entreat, persist, without attaining the object of their suit;
while another comes, and without knowing why or wherefore, finds himself
invested with the place or office so many have sued for; and here it is
that the common saying, ‘There is good luck as well as bad luck in
suits,’ applies. Thou, who, to my thinking, art beyond all doubt a
dullard, without early rising or night watching or taking any trouble,
with the mere breath of knight-errantry that has breathed upon thee, seest
thyself without more ado governor of an island, as though it were a mere
matter of course. This I say, Sancho, that thou attribute not the favour
thou hast received to thine own merits, but give thanks to heaven that
disposes matters beneficently, and secondly thanks to the great power the
profession of knight-errantry contains in itself. With a heart, then,
inclined to believe what I have said to thee, attend, my son, to thy Cato
here who would counsel thee and be thy polestar and guide to direct and
pilot thee to a safe haven out of this stormy sea wherein thou art about
to ingulf thyself; for offices and great trusts are nothing else but a
mighty gulf of troubles.
</p>
<p>
“First of all, my son, thou must fear God, for in the fear of him is
wisdom, and being wise thou canst not err in aught.
</p>
<p>
“Secondly, thou must keep in view what thou art, striving to know
thyself, the most difficult thing to know that the mind can imagine. If
thou knowest thyself, it will follow thou wilt not puff thyself up like
the frog that strove to make himself as large as the ox; if thou dost, the
recollection of having kept pigs in thine own country will serve as the
ugly feet for the wheel of thy folly.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s the truth,” said Sancho; “but that was
when I was a boy; afterwards when I was something more of a man it was
geese I kept, not pigs. But to my thinking that has nothing to do with it;
for all who are governors don’t come of a kingly stock.”
</p>
<p>
“True,” said Don Quixote, “and for that reason those who
are not of noble origin should take care that the dignity of the office
they hold be accompanied by a gentle suavity, which wisely managed will
save them from the sneers of malice that no station escapes.
</p>
<p>
“Glory in thy humble birth, Sancho, and be not ashamed of saying
thou art peasant-born; for when it is seen thou art not ashamed no one
will set himself to put thee to the blush; and pride thyself rather upon
being one of lowly virtue than a lofty sinner. Countless are they who,
born of mean parentage, have risen to the highest dignities, pontifical
and imperial, and of the truth of this I could give thee instances enough
to weary thee.
</p>
<p>
“Remember, Sancho, if thou make virtue thy aim, and take a pride in
doing virtuous actions, thou wilt have no cause to envy those who have
princely and lordly ones, for blood is an inheritance, but virtue an
acquisition, and virtue has in itself alone a worth that blood does not
possess.
</p>
<p>
“This being so, if perchance anyone of thy kinsfolk should come to
see thee when thou art in thine island, thou art not to repel or slight
him, but on the contrary to welcome him, entertain him, and make much of
him; for in so doing thou wilt be approved of heaven (which is not pleased
that any should despise what it hath made), and wilt comply with the laws
of well-ordered nature.
</p>
<p>
“If thou carriest thy wife with thee (and it is not well for those
that administer governments to be long without their wives), teach and
instruct her, and strive to smooth down her natural roughness; for all
that may be gained by a wise governor may be lost and wasted by a boorish
stupid wife.
</p>
<p>
“If perchance thou art left a widower—a thing which may happen—and
in virtue of thy office seekest a consort of higher degree, choose not one
to serve thee for a hook, or for a fishing-rod, or for the hood of thy
‘won’t have it;’ for verily, I tell thee, for all the
judge’s wife receives, the husband will be held accountable at the
general calling to account; where he will have repay in death fourfold,
items that in life he regarded as naught.
</p>
<p>
“Never go by arbitrary law, which is so much favoured by ignorant
men who plume themselves on cleverness.
</p>
<p>
“Let the tears of the poor man find with thee more compassion, but
not more justice, than the pleadings of the rich.
</p>
<p>
“Strive to lay bare the truth, as well amid the promises and
presents of the rich man, as amid the sobs and entreaties of the poor.
</p>
<p>
“When equity may and should be brought into play, press not the
utmost rigour of the law against the guilty; for the reputation of the
stern judge stands not higher than that of the compassionate.
</p>
<p>
“If perchance thou permittest the staff of justice to swerve, let it
be not by the weight of a gift, but by that of mercy.
</p>
<p>
“If it should happen to thee to give judgment in the cause of one
who is thine enemy, turn thy thoughts away from thy injury and fix them on
the justice of the case.
</p>
<p>
“Let not thine own passion blind thee in another man’s cause;
for the errors thou wilt thus commit will be most frequently irremediable;
or if not, only to be remedied at the expense of thy good name and even of
thy fortune.
</p>
<p>
“If any handsome woman come to seek justice of thee, turn away thine
eyes from her tears and thine ears from her lamentations, and consider
deliberately the merits of her demand, if thou wouldst not have thy reason
swept away by her weeping, and thy rectitude by her sighs.
</p>
<p>
“Abuse not by word him whom thou hast to punish in deed, for the
pain of punishment is enough for the unfortunate without the addition of
thine objurgations.
</p>
<p>
“Bear in mind that the culprit who comes under thy jurisdiction is
but a miserable man subject to all the propensities of our depraved
nature, and so far as may be in thy power show thyself lenient and
forbearing; for though the attributes of God are all equal, to our eyes
that of mercy is brighter and loftier than that of justice.
</p>
<p>
“If thou followest these precepts and rules, Sancho, thy days will
be long, thy fame eternal, thy reward abundant, thy felicity unutterable;
thou wilt marry thy children as thou wouldst; they and thy grandchildren
will bear titles; thou wilt live in peace and concord with all men; and,
when life draws to a close, death will come to thee in calm and ripe old
age, and the light and loving hands of thy great-grandchildren will close
thine eyes.
</p>
<p>
“What I have thus far addressed to thee are instructions for the
adornment of thy mind; listen now to those which tend to that of the body.”

<p>
Who, hearing the foregoing discourse of Don Quixote, would not have set
him down for a person of great good sense and greater rectitude of
purpose? But, as has been frequently observed in the course of this great
history, he only talked nonsense when he touched on chivalry, and in
discussing all other subjects showed that he had a clear and unbiassed
understanding; so that at every turn his acts gave the lie to his
intellect, and his intellect to his acts; but in the case of these second
counsels that he gave Sancho, he showed himself to have a lively turn of
humour, and displayed conspicuously his wisdom, and also his folly.
</p>
<p>
Sancho listened to him with the deepest attention, and endeavoured to fix
his counsels in his memory, like one who meant to follow them and by their
means bring the full promise of his government to a happy issue. Don
Quixote, then, went on to say:
</p>
<p>
“With regard to the mode in which thou shouldst govern thy person
and thy house, Sancho, the first charge I have to give thee is to be
clean, and to cut thy nails, not letting them grow as some do, whose
ignorance makes them fancy that long nails are an ornament to their hands,
as if those excrescences they neglect to cut were nails, and not the
talons of a lizard-catching kestrel—a filthy and unnatural abuse.
</p>
<p>
“Go not ungirt and loose, Sancho; for disordered attire is a sign of
an unstable mind, unless indeed the slovenliness and slackness is to be
set down to craft, as was the common opinion in the case of Julius Cæsar.
</p>
<p>
“Ascertain cautiously what thy office may be worth; and if it will
allow thee to give liveries to thy servants, give them respectable and
serviceable, rather than showy and gay ones, and divide them between thy
servants and the poor; that is to say, if thou canst clothe six pages,
clothe three and three poor men, and thus thou wilt have pages for heaven
and pages for earth; the vainglorious never think of this new mode of
giving liveries.
</p>
<p>
“Eat not garlic nor onions, lest they find out thy boorish origin by
the smell; walk slowly and speak deliberately, but not in such a way as to
make it seem thou art listening to thyself, for all affectation is bad.
</p>
<p>
“Dine sparingly and sup more sparingly still; for the health of the
whole body is forged in the workshop of the stomach.
</p>
<p>
“Be temperate in drinking, bearing in mind that wine in excess keeps
neither secrets nor promises.
</p>
<p>
“Take care, Sancho, not to chew on both sides, and not to eruct in
anybody’s presence.”
</p>
<p>
“Eruct!” said Sancho; “I don’t know what that
means.”
</p>
<p>
“To eruct, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “means to belch,
and that is one of the filthiest words in the Spanish language, though a
very expressive one; and therefore nice folk have had recourse to the
Latin, and instead of belch say eruct, and instead of belches say
eructations; and if some do not understand these terms it matters little,
for custom will bring them into use in the course of time, so that they
will be readily understood; this is the way a language is enriched; custom
and the public are all-powerful there.”
</p>
<p>
“In truth, señor,” said Sancho, “one of the counsels and
cautions I mean to bear in mind shall be this, not to belch, for I’m
constantly doing it.”
</p>
<p>
“Eruct, Sancho, not belch,” said Don Quixote.
</p>
<p>
“Eruct, I shall say henceforth, and I swear not to forget it,”
said Sancho.
</p>
<p>
“Likewise, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “thou must not
mingle such a quantity of proverbs in thy discourse as thou dost; for
though proverbs are short maxims, thou dost drag them in so often by the
head and shoulders that they savour more of nonsense than of maxims.”
</p>
<p>
“God alone can cure that,” said Sancho; “for I have more
proverbs in me than a book, and when I speak they come so thick together
into my mouth that they fall to fighting among themselves to get out; that’s
why my tongue lets fly the first that come, though they may not be pat to
the purpose. But I’ll take care henceforward to use such as befit
the dignity of my office; for ‘in a house where there’s
plenty, supper is soon cooked,’ and ‘he who binds does not
wrangle,’ and ‘the bell-ringer’s in a safe berth,’
and ‘giving and keeping require brains.’”
</p>
<p>
“That’s it, Sancho!” said Don Quixote; “pack,
tack, string proverbs together; nobody is hindering thee! ‘My mother
beats me, and I go on with my tricks.’ I am bidding thee avoid
proverbs, and here in a second thou hast shot out a whole litany of them,
which have as much to do with what we are talking about as ‘over the
hills of Úbeda.’ Mind, Sancho, I do not say that a proverb aptly
brought in is objectionable; but to pile up and string together proverbs
at random makes conversation dull and vulgar.
</p>
<p>
“When thou ridest on horseback, do not go lolling with thy body on
the back of the saddle, nor carry thy legs stiff or sticking out from the
horse’s belly, nor yet sit so loosely that one would suppose thou
wert on Dapple; for the seat on a horse makes gentlemen of some and grooms
of others.
</p>
<p>
“Be moderate in thy sleep; for he who does not rise early does not
get the benefit of the day; and remember, Sancho, diligence is the mother
of good fortune, and indolence, its opposite, never yet attained the
object of an honest ambition.
</p>
<p>
“The last counsel I will give thee now, though it does not tend to
bodily improvement, I would have thee carry carefully in thy memory, for I
believe it will be no less useful to thee than those I have given thee
already, and it is this—never engage in a dispute about families, at
least in the way of comparing them one with another; for necessarily one
of those compared will be better than the other, and thou wilt be hated by
the one thou hast disparaged, and get nothing in any shape from the one
thou hast exalted.
</p>
<p>
“Thy attire shall be hose of full length, a long jerkin, and a cloak
a trifle longer; loose breeches by no means, for they are becoming neither
for gentlemen nor for governors.
</p>
<p>
“For the present, Sancho, this is all that has occurred to me to
advise thee; as time goes by and occasions arise my instructions shall
follow, if thou take care to let me know how thou art circumstanced.”
</p>
<p>
“Señor,” said Sancho, “I see well enough that all these
things your worship has said to me are good, holy, and profitable; but
what use will they be to me if I don’t remember one of them? To be
sure that about not letting my nails grow, and marrying again if I have
the chance, will not slip out of my head; but all that other hash, muddle,
and jumble—I don’t and can’t recollect any more of it
than of last year’s clouds; so it must be given me in writing; for
though I can’t either read or write, I’ll give it to my
confessor, to drive it into me and remind me of it whenever it is
necessary.”
</p>
<p>
“Ah, sinner that I am!” said Don Quixote, “how bad it
looks in governors not to know how to read or write; for let me tell thee,
Sancho, when a man knows not how to read, or is left-handed, it argues one
of two things; either that he was the son of exceedingly mean and lowly
parents, or that he himself was so incorrigible and ill-conditioned that
neither good company nor good teaching could make any impression on him.
It is a great defect that thou labourest under, and therefore I would have
thee learn at any rate to sign thy name.”
</p>
<p>
“I can sign my name well enough,” said Sancho, “for when I
was steward of the brotherhood in my village I learned to make certain letters,
like the marks on bales of goods, which they told me made out my name. Besides
I can pretend my right hand is disabled and make someone else sign for me, for
‘there’s a remedy for everything except death;’ and as I
shall be in command and hold the staff, I can do as I like; moreover, ‘he
who has the alcalde for his father—,’ and I’ll be governor,
and that’s higher than alcalde. Only come and see! Let them make light of
me and abuse me; ‘they’ll come for wool and go back shorn;’
‘whom God loves, his house is known to Him;’ ‘the silly
sayings of the rich pass for saws in the world;’ and as I’ll be
rich, being a governor, and at the same time generous, as I mean to be, no
fault will be seen in me. ‘Only make yourself honey and the flies will
suck you;’ ‘as much as thou hast so much art thou worth,’ as
my grandmother used to say; and ‘thou canst have no revenge of a man of
substance.’”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, God’s curse upon thee, Sancho!” here exclaimed Don
Quixote; “sixty thousand devils fly away with thee and thy proverbs!
For the last hour thou hast been stringing them together and inflicting
the pangs of torture on me with every one of them. Those proverbs will
bring thee to the gallows one day, I promise thee; thy subjects will take
the government from thee, or there will be revolts among them. Tell me,
where dost thou pick them up, thou booby? How dost thou apply them, thou
blockhead? For with me, to utter one and make it apply properly, I have to
sweat and labour as if I were digging.”
</p>
<p>
“By God, master mine,” said Sancho, “your worship is
making a fuss about very little. Why the devil should you be vexed if I
make use of what is my own? And I have got nothing else, nor any other
stock in trade except proverbs and more proverbs; and here are three just
this instant come into my head, pat to the purpose and like pears in a
basket; but I won’t repeat them, for ‘sage silence is called
Sancho.’”
