Don Quixote’s neck, said to him, “Your appearance cannot leave
any question as to your name, nor can your name fail to identify your
appearance; unquestionably, señor, you are the real Don Quixote of La
Mancha, cynosure and morning star of knight-errantry, despite and in
defiance of him who has sought to usurp your name and bring to naught your
achievements, as the author of this book which I here present to you has
done;” and with this he put a book which his companion carried into
the hands of Don Quixote, who took it, and without replying began to run
his eye over it; but he presently returned it saying, “In the little
I have seen I have discovered three things in this author that deserve to
be censured. The first is some words that I have read in the preface; the
next that the language is Aragonese, for sometimes he writes without
articles; and the third, which above all stamps him as ignorant, is that
he goes wrong and departs from the truth in the most important part of the
history, for here he says that my squire Sancho Panza’s wife is
called Mari Gutierrez, when she is called nothing of the sort, but Teresa
Panza; and when a man errs on such an important point as this there is
good reason to fear that he is in error on every other point in the
history.”
</p>
<p>
“A nice sort of historian, indeed!” exclaimed Sancho at this;
“he must know a deal about our affairs when he calls my wife Teresa
Panza, Mari Gutierrez; take the book again, señor, and see if I am in it
and if he has changed my name.”
</p>
<p>
“From your talk, friend,” said Don Jeronimo, “no doubt
you are Sancho Panza, Señor Don Quixote’s squire.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, I am,” said Sancho; “and I’m proud of it.”
</p>
<p>
“Faith, then,” said the gentleman, “this new author does
not handle you with the decency that displays itself in your person; he
makes you out a heavy feeder and a fool, and not in the least droll, and a
very different being from the Sancho described in the First Part of your
master’s history.”
</p>
<p>
“God forgive him,” said Sancho; “he might have left me
in my corner without troubling his head about me; ‘let him who knows
how ring the bells; ‘Saint Peter is very well in Rome.’”
</p>
<p>
The two gentlemen pressed Don Quixote to come into their room and have
supper with them, as they knew very well there was nothing in that inn fit
for one of his sort. Don Quixote, who was always polite, yielded to their
request and supped with them. Sancho stayed behind with the stew. and
invested with plenary delegated authority seated himself at the head of
the table, and the landlord sat down with him, for he was no less fond of
cow-heel and calves’ feet than Sancho was.
</p>
<p>
While at supper Don Juan asked Don Quixote what news he had of the lady
Dulcinea del Toboso, was she married, had she been brought to bed, or was
she with child, or did she in maidenhood, still preserving her modesty and
delicacy, cherish the remembrance of the tender passion of Señor Don
Quixote?
</p>
<p>
To this he replied, “Dulcinea is a maiden still, and my passion more
firmly rooted than ever, our intercourse unsatisfactory as before, and her
beauty transformed into that of a foul country wench;” and then he
proceeded to give them a full and particular account of the enchantment of
Dulcinea, and of what had happened him in the cave of Montesinos, together
with what the sage Merlin had prescribed for her disenchantment, namely
the scourging of Sancho.
</p>
<p>
Exceedingly great was the amusement the two gentlemen derived from hearing
Don Quixote recount the strange incidents of his history; and if they were
amazed by his absurdities they were equally amazed by the elegant style in
which he delivered them. On the one hand they regarded him as a man of wit
and sense, and on the other he seemed to them a maundering blockhead, and
they could not make up their minds whereabouts between wisdom and folly
they ought to place him.
</p>
<p>
Sancho having finished his supper, and left the landlord in the X
condition, repaired to the room where his master was, and as he came in
said, “May I die, sirs, if the author of this book your worships
have got has any mind that we should agree; as he calls me glutton
(according to what your worships say) I wish he may not call me drunkard
too.”
</p>
<p>
“But he does,” said Don Jeronimo; “I cannot remember,
however, in what way, though I know his words are offensive, and what is
more, lying, as I can see plainly by the physiognomy of the worthy Sancho
before me.”
</p>
<p>
“Believe me,” said Sancho, “the Sancho and the Don
Quixote of this history must be different persons from those that appear
in the one Cide Hamete Benengeli wrote, who are ourselves; my master
valiant, wise, and true in love, and I simple, droll, and neither glutton
nor drunkard.”
</p>
<p>
“I believe it,” said Don Juan; “and were it possible, an
order should be issued that no one should have the presumption to deal
with anything relating to Don Quixote, save his original author Cide
Hamete; just as Alexander commanded that no one should presume to paint
his portrait save Apelles.”

</p>
<p>
“Let him who will paint me,” said Don Quixote; “but let
him not abuse me; for patience will often break down when they heap
insults upon it.”
</p>
<p>
“None can be offered to Señor Don Quixote,” said Don Juan,
“that he himself will not be able to avenge, if he does not ward it
off with the shield of his patience, which, I take it, is great and
strong.”
</p>
<p>
A considerable portion of the night passed in conversation of this sort,
and though Don Juan wished Don Quixote to read more of the book to see
what it was all about, he was not to be prevailed upon, saying that he
treated it as read and pronounced it utterly silly; and, if by any chance
it should come to its author’s ears that he had it in his hand, he
did not want him to flatter himself with the idea that he had read it; for
our thoughts, and still more our eyes, should keep themselves aloof from
what is obscene and filthy.
</p>
<p>
They asked him whither he meant to direct his steps. He replied, to
Saragossa, to take part in the harness jousts which were held in that city
every year. Don Juan told him that the new history described how Don
Quixote, let him be who he might, took part there in a tilting at the
ring, utterly devoid of invention, poor in mottoes, very poor in costume,
though rich in sillinesses.
</p>
<p>
“For that very reason,” said Don Quixote, “I will not
set foot in Saragossa; and by that means I shall expose to the world the
lie of this new history writer, and people will see that I am not the Don
Quixote he speaks of.”
</p>
<p>
“You will do quite right,” said Don Jeronimo; “and there
are other jousts at Barcelona in which Señor Don Quixote may display his
prowess.”
</p>
<p>
“That is what I mean to do,” said Don Quixote; “and as
it is now time, I pray your worships to give me leave to retire to bed,
and to place and retain me among the number of your greatest friends and
servants.”
</p>
<p>
“And me too,” said Sancho; “maybe I’ll be good for
something.”
</p>
<p>
With this they exchanged farewells, and Don Quixote and Sancho retired to
their room, leaving Don Juan and Don Jeronimo amazed to see the medley he
made of his good sense and his craziness; and they felt thoroughly
convinced that these, and not those their Aragonese author described, were
the genuine Don Quixote and Sancho. Don Quixote rose betimes, and bade
adieu to his hosts by knocking at the partition of the other room. Sancho
paid the landlord magnificently, and recommended him either to say less
about the providing of his inn or to keep it better provided.

</p>
<p>
It was a fresh morning giving promise of a cool day as Don Quixote quitted
the inn, first of all taking care to ascertain the most direct road to
Barcelona without touching upon Saragossa; so anxious was he to make out
this new historian, who they said abused him so, to be a liar. Well, as it
fell out, nothing worthy of being recorded happened him for six days, at
the end of which, having turned aside out of the road, he was overtaken by
night in a thicket of oak or cork trees; for on this point Cide Hamete is
not as precise as he usually is on other matters.
</p>
<p>
Master and man dismounted from their beasts, and as soon as they had
settled themselves at the foot of the trees, Sancho, who had had a good
noontide meal that day, let himself, without more ado, pass the gates of
sleep. But Don Quixote, whom his thoughts, far more than hunger, kept
awake, could not close an eye, and roamed in fancy to and fro through all
sorts of places. At one moment it seemed to him that he was in the cave of
Montesinos and saw Dulcinea, transformed into a country wench, skipping
and mounting upon her she-ass; again that the words of the sage Merlin
were sounding in his ears, setting forth the conditions to be observed and
the exertions to be made for the disenchantment of Dulcinea. He lost all
patience when he considered the laziness and want of charity of his squire
Sancho; for to the best of his belief he had only given himself five
lashes, a number paltry and disproportioned to the vast number required.
At this thought he felt such vexation and anger that he reasoned the
matter thus: “If Alexander the Great cut the Gordian knot, saying,
‘To cut comes to the same thing as to untie,’ and yet did not
fail to become lord paramount of all Asia, neither more nor less could
happen now in Dulcinea’s disenchantment if I scourge Sancho against
his will; for, if it is the condition of the remedy that Sancho shall
receive three thousand and odd lashes, what does it matter to me whether
he inflicts them himself, or someone else inflicts them, when the
essential point is that he receives them, let them come from whatever
quarter they may?”
</p>
<p>
With this idea he went over to Sancho, having first taken Rocinante’s
reins and arranged them so as to be able to flog him with them, and began
to untie the points (the common belief is he had but one in front) by
which his breeches were held up; but the instant he approached him Sancho
woke up in his full senses and cried out, “What is this? Who is
touching me and untrussing me?”
</p>
<p>
“It is I,” said Don Quixote, “and I come to make good
thy shortcomings and relieve my own distresses; I come to whip thee,
Sancho, and wipe off some portion of the debt thou hast undertaken.
Dulcinea is perishing, thou art living on regardless, I am dying of hope
deferred; therefore untruss thyself with a good will, for mine it is,
here, in this retired spot, to give thee at least two thousand lashes.”
</p>
<p>
“Not a bit of it,” said Sancho; “let your worship keep
quiet, or else by the living God the deaf shall hear us; the lashes I
pledged myself to must be voluntary and not forced upon me, and just now I
have no fancy to whip myself; it is enough if I give you my word to flog
and flap myself when I have a mind.”
</p>
<p>
“It will not do to leave it to thy courtesy, Sancho,” said Don
Quixote, “for thou art hard of heart and, though a clown, tender of
flesh;” and at the same time he strove and struggled to untie him.
</p>
<p>
Seeing this Sancho got up, and grappling with his master he gripped him
with all his might in his arms, giving him a trip with the heel stretched
him on the ground on his back, and pressing his right knee on his chest
held his hands in his own so that he could neither move nor breathe.
</p>
<p>
“How now, traitor!” exclaimed Don Quixote. “Dost thou
revolt against thy master and natural lord? Dost thou rise against him who
gives thee his bread?”
</p>
<p>
“I neither put down king, nor set up king,” said Sancho;
“I only stand up for myself who am my own lord; if your worship
promises me to be quiet, and not to offer to whip me now, I’ll let
you go free and unhindered; if not—
</p>
<p class="poem">
Traitor and Doña Sancha’s foe,<br>
Thou diest on the spot.”
</p>
<p>
Don Quixote gave his promise, and swore by the life of his thoughts not to
touch so much as a hair of his garments, and to leave him entirely free
and to his own discretion to whip himself whenever he pleased.
</p>
<p>
<br><br><br><br> <a id="p60c"></a>
</p>
<div class="fig" style="width:60%;">

</p>
<p>
Sancho rose and removed some distance from the spot, but as he was about
to place himself leaning against another tree he felt something touch his
head, and putting up his hands encountered somebody’s two feet with
shoes and stockings on them. He trembled with fear and made for another
tree, where the very same thing happened to him, and he fell a-shouting,
calling upon Don Quixote to come and protect him. Don Quixote did so, and
asked him what had happened to him, and what he was afraid of. Sancho
replied that all the trees were full of men’s feet and legs. Don
Quixote felt them, and guessed at once what it was, and said to Sancho,
“Thou hast nothing to be afraid of, for these feet and legs that
thou feelest but canst not see belong no doubt to some outlaws and
freebooters that have been hanged on these trees; for the authorities in
these parts are wont to hang them up by twenties and thirties when they
catch them; whereby I conjecture that I must be near Barcelona;” and
it was, in fact, as he supposed; with the first light they looked up and
saw that the fruit hanging on those trees were freebooters’ bodies.
</p>
<p>
And now day dawned; and if the dead freebooters had scared them, their
hearts were no less troubled by upwards of forty living ones, who all of a
sudden surrounded them, and in the Catalan tongue bade them stand and wait
until their captain came up. Don Quixote was on foot with his horse
unbridled and his lance leaning against a tree, and in short completely
defenceless; he thought it best therefore to fold his arms and bow his
head and reserve himself for a more favourable occasion and opportunity.
The robbers made haste to search Dapple, and did not leave him a single
thing of all he carried in the alforjas and in the valise; and lucky it
was for Sancho that the duke’s crowns and those he brought from home
were in a girdle that he wore round him; but for all that these good folk
would have stripped him, and even looked to see what he had hidden between
the skin and flesh, but for the arrival at that moment of their captain,
who was about thirty-four years of age apparently, strongly built, above
the middle height, of stern aspect and swarthy complexion. He was mounted
upon a powerful horse, and had on a coat of mail, with four of the pistols
they call petronels in that country at his waist. He saw that his squires
(for so they call those who follow that trade) were about to rifle Sancho
Panza, but he ordered them to desist and was at once obeyed, so the girdle
escaped. He wondered to see the lance leaning against the tree, the shield
on the ground, and Don Quixote in armour and dejected, with the saddest
and most melancholy face that sadness itself could produce; and going up
to him he said, “Be not so cast down, good man, for you have not
fallen into the hands of any inhuman Busiris, but into Roque Guinart’s,
which are more merciful than cruel.”
</p>
<p>
“The cause of my dejection,” returned Don Quixote, “is
not that I have fallen into thy hands, O valiant Roque, whose fame is
bounded by no limits on earth, but that my carelessness should have been
so great that thy soldiers should have caught me unbridled, when it is my
duty, according to the rule of knight-errantry which I profess, to be
always on the alert and at all times my own sentinel; for let me tell
thee, great Roque, had they found me on my horse, with my lance and
shield, it would not have been very easy for them to reduce me to
submission, for I am Don Quixote of La Mancha, he who hath filled the
whole world with his achievements.”
</p>
<p>
Roque Guinart at once perceived that Don Quixote’s weakness was more
akin to madness than to swagger; and though he had sometimes heard him
spoken of, he never regarded the things attributed to him as true, nor
could he persuade himself that such a humour could become dominant in the
heart of man; he was extremely glad, therefore, to meet him and test at
close quarters what he had heard of him at a distance; so he said to him,
“Despair not, valiant knight, nor regard as an untoward fate the
position in which thou findest thyself; it may be that by these slips thy
crooked fortune will make itself straight; for heaven by strange
circuitous ways, mysterious and incomprehensible to man, raises up the
fallen and makes rich the poor.”
</p>
<p>
Don Quixote was about to thank him, when they heard behind them a noise as
of a troop of horses; there was, however, but one, riding on which at a
furious pace came a youth, apparently about twenty years of age, clad in
green damask edged with gold and breeches and a loose frock, with a hat
looped up in the Walloon fashion, tight-fitting polished boots, gilt
spurs, dagger and sword, and in his hand a musketoon, and a pair of
pistols at his waist.
</p>
<p>
Roque turned round at the noise and perceived this comely figure, which
drawing near thus addressed him, “I came in quest of thee, valiant
Roque, to find in thee if not a remedy at least relief in my misfortune;
and not to keep thee in suspense, for I see thou dost not recognise me, I
will tell thee who I am; I am Claudia Jeronima, the daughter of Simon
Forte, thy good friend, and special enemy of Clauquel Torrellas, who is
thine also as being of the faction opposed to thee. Thou knowest that this
Torrellas has a son who is called, or at least was not two hours since,
Don Vicente Torrellas. Well, to cut short the tale of my misfortune, I
will tell thee in a few words what this youth has brought upon me. He saw
me, he paid court to me, I listened to him, and, unknown to my father, I
loved him; for there is no woman, however secluded she may live or close
she may be kept, who will not have opportunities and to spare for
following her headlong impulses. In a word, he pledged himself to be mine,
and I promised to be his, without carrying matters any further. Yesterday
I learned that, forgetful of his pledge to me, he was about to marry
another, and that he was to go this morning to plight his troth,
intelligence which overwhelmed and exasperated me; my father not being at
home I was able to adopt this costume you see, and urging my horse to
speed I overtook Don Vicente about a league from this, and without waiting
to utter reproaches or hear excuses I fired this musket at him, and these
two pistols besides, and to the best of my belief I must have lodged more
than two bullets in his body, opening doors to let my honour go free,
enveloped in his blood. I left him there in the hands of his servants, who
did not dare and were not able to interfere in his defence, and I come to
seek from thee a safe-conduct into France, where I have relatives with
whom I can live; and also to implore thee to protect my father, so that
Don Vicente’s numerous kinsmen may not venture to wreak their
lawless vengeance upon him.”
</p>
<p>
Roque, filled with admiration at the gallant bearing, high spirit, comely
figure, and adventure of the fair Claudia, said to her, “Come,
señora, let us go and see if thy enemy is dead; and then we will consider
what will be best for thee.” Don Quixote, who had been listening to
what Claudia said and Roque Guinart said in reply to her, exclaimed,
“Nobody need trouble himself with the defence of this lady, for I
take it upon myself. Give me my horse and arms, and wait for me here; I
will go in quest of this knight, and dead or alive I will make him keep
his word plighted to so great beauty.”
</p>
<p>
“Nobody need have any doubt about that,” said Sancho, “for
my master has a very happy knack of matchmaking; it’s not many days
since he forced another man to marry, who in the same way backed out of
his promise to another maiden; and if it had not been for his persecutors
the enchanters changing the man’s proper shape into a lacquey’s
the said maiden would not be one this minute.”
</p>
<p>
Roque, who was paying more attention to the fair Claudia’s adventure
than to the words of master or man, did not hear them; and ordering his
squires to restore to Sancho everything they had stripped Dapple of, he
directed them to return to the place where they had been quartered during
the night, and then set off with Claudia at full speed in search of the
wounded or slain Don Vicente. They reached the spot where Claudia met him,
but found nothing there save freshly spilt blood; looking all round,
however, they descried some people on the slope of a hill above them, and
concluded, as indeed it proved to be, that it was Don Vicente, whom either
dead or alive his servants were removing to attend to his wounds or to
bury him. They made haste to overtake them, which, as the party moved
slowly, they were able to do with ease. They found Don Vicente in the arms
of his servants, whom he was entreating in a broken feeble voice to leave
him there to die, as the pain of his wounds would not suffer him to go any
farther. Claudia and Roque threw themselves off their horses and advanced
towards him; the servants were overawed by the appearance of Roque, and
Claudia was moved by the sight of Don Vicente, and going up to him half
tenderly half sternly, she seized his hand and said to him, “Hadst
thou given me this according to our compact thou hadst never come to this
pass.”
</p>
<p>
The wounded gentleman opened his all but closed eyes, and recognising
Claudia said, “I see clearly, fair and mistaken lady, that it is
thou that hast slain me, a punishment not merited or deserved by my
feelings towards thee, for never did I mean to, nor could I, wrong thee in
thought or deed.”
</p>
<p>
“It is not true, then,” said Claudia, “that thou wert
going this morning to marry Leonora the daughter of the rich Balvastro?”
</p>
<p>
“Assuredly not,” replied Don Vicente; “my cruel fortune
must have carried those tidings to thee to drive thee in thy jealousy to
take my life; and to assure thyself of this, press my hands and take me
for thy husband if thou wilt; I have no better satisfaction to offer thee
for the wrong thou fanciest thou hast received from me.”
</p>
<p>
Claudia wrung his hands, and her own heart was so wrung that she lay
fainting on the bleeding breast of Don Vicente, whom a death spasm seized
the same instant. Roque was in perplexity and knew not what to do; the
servants ran to fetch water to sprinkle their faces, and brought some and
bathed them with it. Claudia recovered from her fainting fit, but not so
Don Vicente from the paroxysm that had overtaken him, for his life had
come to an end. On perceiving this, Claudia, when she had convinced
herself that her beloved husband was no more, rent the air with her sighs
and made the heavens ring with her lamentations; she tore her hair and
scattered it to the winds, she beat her face with her hands and showed all
the signs of grief and sorrow that could be conceived to come from an
afflicted heart. “Cruel, reckless woman!” she cried, “how
easily wert thou moved to carry out a thought so wicked! O furious force
of jealousy, to what desperate lengths dost thou lead those that give thee
lodging in their bosoms! O husband, whose unhappy fate in being mine hath
borne thee from the marriage bed to the grave!”
</p>
<p>
So vehement and so piteous were the lamentations of Claudia that they drew
tears from Roque’s eyes, unused as they were to shed them on any
occasion. The servants wept, Claudia swooned away again and again, and the
whole place seemed a field of sorrow and an abode of misfortune. In the
end Roque Guinart directed Don Vicente’s servants to carry his body
to his father’s village, which was close by, for burial. Claudia
told him she meant to go to a monastery of which an aunt of hers was
abbess, where she intended to pass her life with a better and everlasting
spouse. He applauded her pious resolution, and offered to accompany her
whithersoever she wished, and to protect her father against the kinsmen of
Don Vicente and all the world, should they seek to injure him. Claudia
would not on any account allow him to accompany her; and thanking him for
his offers as well as she could, took leave of him in tears. The servants
of Don Vicente carried away his body, and Roque returned to his comrades,
and so ended the love of Claudia Jeronima; but what wonder, when it was
the insuperable and cruel might of jealousy that wove the web of her sad
story?

</p>
<p>
Roque Guinart found his squires at the place to which he had ordered them,
and Don Quixote on Rocinante in the midst of them delivering a harangue to
them in which he urged them to give up a mode of life so full of peril, as
well to the soul as to the body; but as most of them were Gascons, rough
lawless fellows, his speech did not make much impression on them. Roque on
coming up asked Sancho if his men had returned and restored to him the
treasures and jewels they had stripped off Dapple. Sancho said they had,
but that three kerchiefs that were worth three cities were missing.
</p>
<p>
“What are you talking about, man?” said one of the bystanders;
“I have got them, and they are not worth three reals.”
</p>
<p>
“That is true,” said Don Quixote; “but my squire values
them at the rate he says, as having been given me by the person who gave
them.”
</p>
<p>
Roque Guinart ordered them to be restored at once; and making his men fall
in in line he directed all the clothing, jewellery, and money that they
had taken since the last distribution to be produced; and making a hasty
valuation, and reducing what could not be divided into money, he made
shares for the whole band so equitably and carefully, that in no case did
he exceed or fall short of strict distributive justice.
</p>
<p>
When this had been done, and all left satisfied, Roque observed to Don
Quixote, “If this scrupulous exactness were not observed with these
fellows there would be no living with them.”
</p>
<p>
Upon this Sancho remarked, “From what I have seen here, justice is
such a good thing that there is no doing without it, even among the
thieves themselves.”
</p>
<p>
One of the squires heard this, and raising the butt-end of his harquebuss
would no doubt have broken Sancho’s head with it had not Roque
Guinart called out to him to hold his hand. Sancho was frightened out of
his wits, and vowed not to open his lips so long as he was in the company
of these people.
</p>
<p>
At this instant one or two of those squires who were posted as sentinels
on the roads, to watch who came along them and report what passed to their
chief, came up and said, “Señor, there is a great troop of people
not far off coming along the road to Barcelona.”
</p>
<p>
To which Roque replied, “Hast thou made out whether they are of the
sort that are after us, or of the sort we are after?”
</p>
<p>
“The sort we are after,” said the squire.
</p>
<p>
“Well then, away with you all,” said Roque, “and bring
them here to me at once without letting one of them escape.”
</p>

</p>
<p>
They obeyed, and Don Quixote, Sancho, and Roque, left by themselves,
waited to see what the squires brought, and while they were waiting Roque
said to Don Quixote, “It must seem a strange sort of life to Señor
Don Quixote, this of ours, strange adventures, strange incidents, and all
full of danger; and I do not wonder that it should seem so, for in truth I
must own there is no mode of life more restless or anxious than ours. What
led me into it was a certain thirst for vengeance, which is strong enough
to disturb the quietest hearts. I am by nature tender-hearted and kindly,
but, as I said, the desire to revenge myself for a wrong that was done me
so overturns all my better impulses that I keep on in this way of life in
spite of what conscience tells me; and as one depth calls to another, and
one sin to another sin, revenges have linked themselves together, and I
have taken upon myself not only my own but those of others: it pleases
God, however, that, though I see myself in this maze of entanglements, I
do not lose all hope of escaping from it and reaching a safe port.”
</p>
<p>
Don Quixote was amazed to hear Roque utter such excellent and just
sentiments, for he did not think that among those who followed such trades
as robbing, murdering, and waylaying, there could be anyone capable of a
virtuous thought, and he said in reply, “Señor Roque, the beginning
of health lies in knowing the disease and in the sick man’s
willingness to take the medicines which the physician prescribes; you are
sick, you know what ails you, and heaven, or more properly speaking God,
who is our physician, will administer medicines that will cure you, and
cure gradually, and not of a sudden or by a miracle; besides, sinners of
discernment are nearer amendment than those who are fools; and as your
worship has shown good sense in your remarks, all you have to do is to
keep up a good heart and trust that the weakness of your conscience will
be strengthened. And if you have any desire to shorten the journey and put
yourself easily in the way of salvation, come with me, and I will show you
how to become a knight-errant, a calling wherein so many hardships and
mishaps are encountered that if they be taken as penances they will lodge
you in heaven in a trice.”
</p>
<p>
Roque laughed at Don Quixote’s exhortation, and changing the
conversation he related the tragic affair of Claudia Jeronima, at which
Sancho was extremely grieved; for he had not found the young woman’s
beauty, boldness, and spirit at all amiss.
</p>
<p>
And now the squires despatched to make the prize came up, bringing with
them two gentlemen on horseback, two pilgrims on foot, and a coach full of
women with some six servants on foot and on horseback in attendance on
them, and a couple of muleteers whom the gentlemen had with them. The
squires made a ring round them, both victors and vanquished maintaining
profound silence, waiting for the great Roque Guinart to speak. He asked
the gentlemen who they were, whither they were going, and what money they
carried with them; “Señor,” replied one of them, “we are
two captains of Spanish infantry; our companies are at Naples, and we are
on our way to embark in four galleys which they say are at Barcelona under
orders for Sicily; and we have about two or three hundred crowns, with
which we are, according to our notions, rich and contented, for a soldier’s
poverty does not allow a more extensive hoard.”
</p>
<p>
Roque asked the pilgrims the same questions he had put to the captains,
and was answered that they were going to take ship for Rome, and that
between them they might have about sixty reals. He asked also who was in
the coach, whither they were bound and what money they had, and one of the
men on horseback replied, “The persons in the coach are my lady Doña
Guiomar de Quiñones, wife of the regent of the Vicaria at Naples, her
little daughter, a handmaid and a duenna; we six servants are in
attendance upon her, and the money amounts to six hundred crowns.”
</p>
<p>
“So then,” said Roque Guinart, “we have got here nine
hundred crowns and sixty reals; my soldiers must number some sixty; see
how much there falls to each, for I am a bad arithmetician.” As soon
as the robbers heard this they raised a shout of “Long life to Roque
Guinart, in spite of the lladres that seek his ruin!”
</p>
<p>
The captains showed plainly the concern they felt, the regent’s lady
was downcast, and the pilgrims did not at all enjoy seeing their property
confiscated. Roque kept them in suspense in this way for a while; but he
had no desire to prolong their distress, which might be seen a bowshot
off, and turning to the captains he said, “Sirs, will your worships
be pleased of your courtesy to lend me sixty crowns, and her ladyship the
regent’s wife eighty, to satisfy this band that follows me, for
‘it is by his singing the abbot gets his dinner;’ and then you
may at once proceed on your journey, free and unhindered, with a
safe-conduct which I shall give you, so that if you come across any other
bands of mine that I have scattered in these parts, they may do you no
harm; for I have no intention of doing injury to soldiers, or to any
woman, especially one of quality.”
</p>
<p>
Profuse and hearty were the expressions of gratitude with which the
captains thanked Roque for his courtesy and generosity; for such they
regarded his leaving them their own money. Señora Doña Guiomar de Quiñones
wanted to throw herself out of the coach to kiss the feet and hands of the
great Roque, but he would not suffer it on any account; so far from that,
he begged her pardon for the wrong he had done her under pressure of the
inexorable necessities of his unfortunate calling. The regent’s lady
ordered one of her servants to give the eighty crowns that had been
assessed as her share at once, for the captains had already paid down
their sixty. The pilgrims were about to give up the whole of their little
hoard, but Roque bade them keep quiet, and turning to his men he said,
“Of these crowns two fall to each man and twenty remain over; let
ten be given to these pilgrims, and the other ten to this worthy squire
that he may be able to speak favourably of this adventure;” and then
having writing materials, with which he always went provided, brought to
him, he gave them in writing a safe-conduct to the leaders of his bands;
and bidding them farewell let them go free and filled with admiration at
his magnanimity, his generous disposition, and his unusual conduct, and
inclined to regard him as an Alexander the Great rather than a notorious
robber.
</p>
<p>
One of the squires observed in his mixture of Gascon and Catalan, “This
captain of ours would make a better friar than highwayman; if he wants to
be so generous another time, let it be with his own property and not ours.”

<p>
The unlucky wight did not speak so low but that Roque overheard him, and
drawing his sword almost split his head in two, saying, “That is the
way I punish impudent saucy fellows.” They were all taken aback, and
not one of them dared to utter a word, such deference did they pay him.
Roque then withdrew to one side and wrote a letter to a friend of his at
Barcelona, telling him that the famous Don Quixote of La Mancha, the
knight-errant of whom there was so much talk, was with him, and was, he
assured him, the drollest and wisest man in the world; and that in four
days from that date, that is to say, on Saint John the Baptist’s
Day, he was going to deposit him in full armour mounted on his horse
Rocinante, together with his squire Sancho on an ass, in the middle of the
strand of the city; and bidding him give notice of this to his friends the
Niarros, that they might divert themselves with him. He wished, he said,
his enemies the Cadells could be deprived of this pleasure; but that was
impossible, because the crazes and shrewd sayings of Don Quixote and the
humours of his squire Sancho Panza could not help giving general pleasure
to all the world. He despatched the letter by one of his squires, who,
exchanging the costume of a highwayman for that of a peasant, made his way
into Barcelona and gave it to the person to whom it was directed.

Don Quixote passed three days and three nights with Roque, and had he
passed three hundred years he would have found enough to observe and
wonder at in his mode of life. At daybreak they were in one spot, at
dinner-time in another; sometimes they fled without knowing from whom, at
other times they lay in wait, not knowing for what. They slept standing,
breaking their slumbers to shift from place to place. There was nothing
but sending out spies and scouts, posting sentinels and blowing the
matches of harquebusses, though they carried but few, for almost all used
flintlocks. Roque passed his nights in some place or other apart from his
men, that they might not know where he was, for the many proclamations the
viceroy of Barcelona had issued against his life kept him in fear and
uneasiness, and he did not venture to trust anyone, afraid that even his
own men would kill him or deliver him up to the authorities; of a truth, a
weary miserable life! At length, by unfrequented roads, short cuts, and
secret paths, Roque, Don Quixote, and Sancho, together with six squires,
set out for Barcelona. They reached the strand on Saint John’s Eve
during the night; and Roque, after embracing Don Quixote and Sancho (to
whom he presented the ten crowns he had promised but had not until then
given), left them with many expressions of good-will on both sides.
</p>
<p>
Roque went back, while Don Quixote remained on horseback, just as he was,
waiting for day, and it was not long before the countenance of the fair
Aurora began to show itself at the balconies of the east, gladdening the
grass and flowers, if not the ear, though to gladden that too there came
at the same moment a sound of clarions and drums, and a din of bells, and
a tramp, tramp, and cries of “Clear the way there!” of some
runners, that seemed to issue from the city.

</p>
<p>
The dawn made way for the sun that with a face broader than a buckler
began to rise slowly above the low line of the horizon; Don Quixote and
Sancho gazed all round them; they beheld the sea, a sight until then
unseen by them; it struck them as exceedingly spacious and broad, much
more so than the lakes of Ruidera which they had seen in La Mancha. They
saw the galleys along the beach, which, lowering their awnings, displayed
themselves decked with streamers and pennons that trembled in the breeze
and kissed and swept the water, while on board the bugles, trumpets, and
clarions were sounding and filling the air far and near with melodious
warlike notes. Then they began to move and execute a kind of skirmish upon
the calm water, while a vast number of horsemen on fine horses and in
showy liveries, issuing from the city, engaged on their side in a somewhat
similar movement. The soldiers on board the galleys kept up a ceaseless
fire, which they on the walls and forts of the city returned, and the
heavy cannon rent the air with the tremendous noise they made, to which
the gangway guns of the galleys replied. The bright sea, the smiling
earth, the clear air—though at times darkened by the smoke of the
guns—all seemed to fill the whole multitude with unexpected delight.
Sancho could not make out how it was that those great masses that moved
over the sea had so many feet.
</p>
<p>
And now the horsemen in livery came galloping up with shouts and
outlandish cries and cheers to where Don Quixote stood amazed and
wondering; and one of them, he to whom Roque had sent word, addressing him
exclaimed, “Welcome to our city, mirror, beacon, star and cynosure
of all knight-errantry in its widest extent! Welcome, I say, valiant Don
Quixote of La Mancha; not the false, the fictitious, the apocryphal, that
these latter days have offered us in lying histories, but the true, the
legitimate, the real one that Cide Hamete Benengeli, flower of historians,
has described to us!”
</p>
<p>
Don Quixote made no answer, nor did the horsemen wait for one, but
wheeling again with all their followers, they began curvetting round Don
Quixote, who, turning to Sancho, said, “These gentlemen have plainly
recognised us; I will wager they have read our history, and even that
newly printed one by the Aragonese.”
</p>
<p>
The cavalier who had addressed Don Quixote again approached him and said,
“Come with us, Señor Don Quixote, for we are all of us your servants
and great friends of Roque Guinart’s;” to which Don Quixote
returned, “If courtesy breeds courtesy, yours, sir knight, is
daughter or very nearly akin to the great Roque’s; carry me where
you please; I will have no will but yours, especially if you deign to
employ it in your service.”
</p>
<p>
<br><br><br><br> <a id="p61c"></a>

<div class="fig" style="width:60%;">

</p>
<p>
The cavalier replied with words no less polite, and then, all closing in
around him, they set out with him for the city, to the music of the
clarions and the drums. As they were entering it, the wicked one, who is
the author of all mischief, and the boys who are wickeder than the wicked
one, contrived that a couple of these audacious irrepressible urchins
should force their way through the crowd, and lifting up, one of them
Dapple’s tail and the other Rocinante’s, insert a bunch of
furze under each. The poor beasts felt the strange spurs and added to
their anguish by pressing their tails tight, so much so that, cutting a
multitude of capers, they flung their masters to the ground. Don Quixote,
covered with shame and out of countenance, ran to pluck the plume from his
poor jade’s tail, while Sancho did the same for Dapple. His
conductors tried to punish the audacity of the boys, but there was no
possibility of doing so, for they hid themselves among the hundreds of
others that were following them. Don Quixote and Sancho mounted once more,
and with the same music and acclamations reached their conductor’s
house, which was large and stately, that of a rich gentleman, in short;
and there for the present we will leave them, for such is Cide Hamete’s
pleasure.

</p>
<p>
Don Quixote’s host was one Don Antonio Moreno by name, a gentleman
of wealth and intelligence, and very fond of diverting himself in any fair
and good-natured way; and having Don Quixote in his house he set about
devising modes of making him exhibit his mad points in some harmless
fashion; for jests that give pain are no jests, and no sport is worth
anything if it hurts another. The first thing he did was to make Don
Quixote take off his armour, and lead him, in that tight chamois suit we
have already described and depicted more than once, out on a balcony
overhanging one of the chief streets of the city, in full view of the
crowd and of the boys, who gazed at him as they would at a monkey. The
cavaliers in livery careered before him again as though it were for him
alone, and not to enliven the festival of the day, that they wore it, and
Sancho was in high delight, for it seemed to him that, how he knew not, he
had fallen upon another Camacho’s wedding, another house like Don
Diego de Miranda’s, another castle like the duke’s. Some of
Don Antonio’s friends dined with him that day, and all showed honour
to Don Quixote and treated him as a knight-errant, and he becoming puffed
up and exalted in consequence could not contain himself for satisfaction.
Such were the drolleries of Sancho that all the servants of the house, and
all who heard him, were kept hanging upon his lips. While at table Don
Antonio said to him, “We hear, worthy Sancho, that you are so fond
of manjar blanco and forced-meat balls, that if you have any left, you
keep them in your bosom for the next day.”
</p>
<p>
“No, señor, that’s not true,” said Sancho, “for I
am more cleanly than greedy, and my master Don Quixote here knows well
that we two are used to live for a week on a handful of acorns or nuts. To
be sure, if it so happens that they offer me a heifer, I run with a
halter; I mean, I eat what I’m given, and make use of opportunities
as I find them; but whoever says that I’m an out-of-the-way eater or
not cleanly, let me tell him that he is wrong; and I’d put it in a
different way if I did not respect the honourable beards that are at the
table.”
</p>
<p>
“Indeed,” said Don Quixote, “Sancho’s moderation
and cleanliness in eating might be inscribed and graved on plates of
brass, to be kept in eternal remembrance in ages to come. It is true that
when he is hungry there is a certain appearance of voracity about him, for
he eats at a great pace and chews with both jaws; but cleanliness he is
always mindful of; and when he was governor he learned how to eat
daintily, so much so that he eats grapes, and even pomegranate pips, with
a fork.”
</p>
<p>
“What!” said Don Antonio, “has Sancho been a governor?”
</p>
<p>
“Ay,” said Sancho, “and of an island called Barataria. I
governed it to perfection for ten days; and lost my rest all the time; and
learned to look down upon all the governments in the world; I got out of
it by taking to flight, and fell into a pit where I gave myself up for
dead, and out of which I escaped alive by a miracle.”
</p>
<p>
Don Quixote then gave them a minute account of the whole affair of Sancho’s
government, with which he greatly amused his hearers.
</p>
<p>
On the cloth being removed Don Antonio, taking Don Quixote by the hand,
passed with him into a distant room in which there was nothing in the way
of furniture except a table, apparently of jasper, resting on a pedestal
of the same, upon which was set up, after the fashion of the busts of the
Roman emperors, a head which seemed to be of bronze. Don Antonio traversed
the whole apartment with Don Quixote and walked round the table several
times, and then said, “Now, Señor Don Quixote, that I am satisfied
that no one is listening to us, and that the door is shut, I will tell you
of one of the rarest adventures, or more properly speaking strange things,
that can be imagined, on condition that you will keep what I say to you in
the remotest recesses of secrecy.”
</p>
<p>
“I swear it,” said Don Quixote, “and for greater
security I will put a flag-stone over it; for I would have you know, Señor
Don Antonio” (he had by this time learned his name), “that you
are addressing one who, though he has ears to hear, has no tongue to
speak; so that you may safely transfer whatever you have in your bosom
into mine, and rely upon it that you have consigned it to the depths of
silence.”
</p>
<p>
“In reliance upon that promise,” said Don Antonio, “I
will astonish you with what you shall see and hear, and relieve myself of
some of the vexation it gives me to have no one to whom I can confide my
secrets, for they are not of a sort to be entrusted to everybody.”
</p>
<p>
Don Quixote was puzzled, wondering what could be the object of such
precautions; whereupon Don Antonio taking his hand passed it over the
bronze head and the whole table and the pedestal of jasper on which it
stood, and then said, “This head, Señor Don Quixote, has been made
and fabricated by one of the greatest magicians and wizards the world ever
saw, a Pole, I believe, by birth, and a pupil of the famous Escotillo of
whom such marvellous stories are told. He was here in my house, and for a
consideration of a thousand crowns that I gave him he constructed this
head, which has the property and virtue of answering whatever questions
are put to its ear. He observed the points of the compass, he traced
figures, he studied the stars, he watched favourable moments, and at
length brought it to the perfection we shall see to-morrow, for on Fridays
it is mute, and this being Friday we must wait till the next day. In the
interval your worship may consider what you would like to ask it; and I
know by experience that in all its answers it tells the truth.”
</p>
<p>
Don Quixote was amazed at the virtue and property of the head, and was
inclined to disbelieve Don Antonio; but seeing what a short time he had to
wait to test the matter, he did not choose to say anything except that he
thanked him for having revealed to him so mighty a secret. They then
quitted the room, Don Antonio locked the door, and they repaired to the
chamber where the rest of the gentlemen were assembled. In the meantime
Sancho had recounted to them several of the adventures and accidents that
had happened his master.
</p>
<p>
That afternoon they took Don Quixote out for a stroll, not in his armour
but in street costume, with a surcoat of tawny cloth upon him, that at
that season would have made ice itself sweat. Orders were left with the
servants to entertain Sancho so as not to let him leave the house. Don
Quixote was mounted, not on Rocinante, but upon a tall mule of easy pace
and handsomely caparisoned. They put the surcoat on him, and on the back,
without his perceiving it, they stitched a parchment on which they wrote
in large letters, “This is Don Quixote of La Mancha.” As they
set out upon their excursion the placard attracted the eyes of all who
chanced to see him, and as they read out, “This is Don Quixote of La
Mancha,” Don Quixote was amazed to see how many people gazed at him,
called him by his name, and recognised him, and turning to Don Antonio,
who rode at his side, he observed to him, “Great are the privileges
knight-errantry involves, for it makes him who professes it known and
famous in every region of the earth; see, Don Antonio, even the very boys
of this city know me without ever having seen me.”
</p>
<p>
“True, Señor Don Quixote,” returned Don Antonio; “for as
fire cannot be hidden or kept secret, virtue cannot escape being
recognised; and that which is attained by the profession of arms shines
distinguished above all others.”
</p>
<p>
It came to pass, however, that as Don Quixote was proceeding amid the
acclamations that have been described, a Castilian, reading the
inscription on his back, cried out in a loud voice, “The devil take
thee for a Don Quixote of La Mancha! What! art thou here, and not dead of
the countless drubbings that have fallen on thy ribs? Thou art mad; and if
thou wert so by thyself, and kept thyself within thy madness, it would not
be so bad; but thou hast the gift of making fools and blockheads of all
who have anything to do with thee or say to thee. Why, look at these
gentlemen bearing thee company! Get thee home, blockhead, and see after
thy affairs, and thy wife and children, and give over these fooleries that
are sapping thy brains and skimming away thy wits.”
</p>
<p>
“Go your own way, brother,” said Don Antonio, “and don’t
offer advice to those who don’t ask you for it. Señor Don Quixote is
in his full senses, and we who bear him company are not fools; virtue is
to be honoured wherever it may be found; go, and bad luck to you, and don’t
meddle where you are not wanted.”
</p>
<p>
“By God, your worship is right,” replied the Castilian;
“for to advise this good man is to kick against the pricks; still
for all that it fills me with pity that the sound wit they say the
blockhead has in everything should dribble away by the channel of his
knight-errantry; but may the bad luck your worship talks of follow me and
all my descendants, if, from this day forth, though I should live longer
than Methuselah, I ever give advice to anybody even if he asks me for it.”
</p>
<p>
The advice-giver took himself off, and they continued their stroll; but so
great was the press of the boys and people to read the placard, that Don
Antonio was forced to remove it as if he were taking off something else.

Night came and they went home, and there was a ladies’ dancing
party, for Don Antonio’s wife, a lady of rank and gaiety, beauty and
wit, had invited some friends of hers to come and do honour to her guest
and amuse themselves with his strange delusions. Several of them came,
they supped sumptuously, the dance began at about ten o’clock. Among
the ladies were two of a mischievous and frolicsome turn, and, though
perfectly modest, somewhat free in playing tricks for harmless diversion’s
sake. These two were so indefatigable in taking Don Quixote out to dance
that they tired him down, not only in body but in spirit. It was a sight
to see the figure Don Quixote made, long, lank, lean, and yellow, his
garments clinging tight to him, ungainly, and above all anything but
agile.

</p>
<p>
The gay ladies made secret love to him, and he on his part secretly repelled
them, but finding himself hard pressed by their blandishments he lifted up his
voice and exclaimed, “<i>Fugite, partes adversæ!</i> Leave me in peace,
unwelcome overtures; avaunt, with your desires, ladies, for she who is queen of
mine, the peerless Dulcinea del Toboso, suffers none but hers to lead me
captive and subdue me;” and so saying he sat down on the floor in the
middle of the room, tired out and broken down by all this exertion in the dance.
</p>
<p>
Don Antonio directed him to be taken up bodily and carried to bed, and the
first that laid hold of him was Sancho, saying as he did so, “In an
evil hour you took to dancing, master mine; do you fancy all mighty men of
valour are dancers, and all knights-errant given to capering? If you do, I
can tell you you are mistaken; there’s many a man would rather
undertake to kill a giant than cut a caper. If it had been the shoe-fling
you were at I could take your place, for I can do the shoe-fling like a
gerfalcon; but I’m no good at dancing.”
</p>
<p>
With these and other observations Sancho set the whole ball-room laughing,
and then put his master to bed, covering him up well so that he might
sweat out any chill caught after his dancing.
</p>
<p>
The next day Don Antonio thought he might as well make trial of the
enchanted head, and with Don Quixote, Sancho, and two others, friends of
his, besides the two ladies that had tired out Don Quixote at the ball,
who had remained for the night with Don Antonio’s wife, he locked
himself up in the chamber where the head was. He explained to them the
property it possessed and entrusted the secret to them, telling them that
now for the first time he was going to try the virtue of the enchanted
head; but except Don Antonio’s two friends no one else was privy to
the mystery of the enchantment, and if Don Antonio had not first revealed
it to them they would have been inevitably reduced to the same state of
amazement as the rest, so artfully and skilfully was it contrived.
</p>
<p>
The first to approach the ear of the head was Don Antonio himself, and in
a low voice but not so low as not to be audible to all, he said to it,
“Head, tell me by the virtue that lies in thee what am I at this
moment thinking of?”
</p>
<p>
The head, without any movement of the lips, answered in a clear and
distinct voice, so as to be heard by all, “I cannot judge of
thoughts.”
</p>
<p>
All were thunderstruck at this, and all the more so as they saw that there
was nobody anywhere near the table or in the whole room that could have
answered. “How many of us are here?” asked Don Antonio once
more; and it was answered him in the same way softly, “Thou and thy
wife, with two friends of thine and two of hers, and a famous knight
called Don Quixote of La Mancha, and a squire of his, Sancho Panza by
name.”
</p>
<p>
Now there was fresh astonishment; now everyone’s hair was standing on end
with awe; and Don Antonio retiring from the head exclaimed, “This
suffices to show me that I have not been deceived by him who sold thee to me, O
sage head, talking head, answering head, wonderful head! Let someone else go
and put what question he likes to it.”
</p>
<p>
And as women are commonly impulsive and inquisitive, the first to come
forward was one of the two friends of Don Antonio’s wife, and her
question was, “Tell me, Head, what shall I do to be very beautiful?”
and the answer she got was, “Be very modest.”
</p>
<p>
“I question thee no further,” said the fair querist.
</p>
<p>
Her companion then came up and said, “I should like to know, Head,
whether my husband loves me or not;” the answer given to her was,
“Think how he uses thee, and thou mayest guess;” and the
married lady went off saying, “That answer did not need a question;
for of course the treatment one receives shows the disposition of him from
whom it is received.”
</p>
<p>
Then one of Don Antonio’s two friends advanced and asked it, “Who
am I?” “Thou knowest,” was the answer. “That is
not what I ask thee,” said the gentleman, “but to tell me if
thou knowest me.” “Yes, I know thee, thou art Don Pedro Noriz,”
was the reply.
</p>
<p>
“I do not seek to know more,” said the gentleman, “for
this is enough to convince me, O Head, that thou knowest everything;”
and as he retired the other friend came forward and asked it, “Tell
me, Head, what are the wishes of my eldest son?”
</p>
<p>
“I have said already,” was the answer, “that I cannot
judge of wishes; however, I can tell thee the wish of thy son is to bury
thee.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s ‘what I see with my eyes I point out with my
finger,’” said the gentleman, “so I ask no more.”
</p>
<p>
Don Antonio’s wife came up and said, “I know not what to ask
thee, Head; I would only seek to know of thee if I shall have many years
of enjoyment of my good husband;” and the answer she received was,
“Thou shalt, for his vigour and his temperate habits promise many
years of life, which by their intemperance others so often cut short.”
</p>
<p>
Then Don Quixote came forward and said, “Tell me, thou that
answerest, was that which I describe as having happened to me in the cave
of Montesinos the truth or a dream? Will Sancho’s whipping be
accomplished without fail? Will the disenchantment of Dulcinea be brought
about?”
</p>
<p>
<br><br><br><br> <a id="p62d"></a>
</p>
<div class="fig" style="width:60%;">

</p>
<p>
“As to the question of the cave,” was the reply, “there
is much to be said; there is something of both in it. Sancho’s
whipping will proceed leisurely. The disenchantment of Dulcinea will
attain its due consummation.”
</p>
<p>
“I seek to know no more,” said Don Quixote; “let me but
see Dulcinea disenchanted, and I will consider that all the good fortune I
could wish for has come upon me all at once.”
</p>
<p>
The last questioner was Sancho, and his questions were, “Head, shall
I by any chance have another government? Shall I ever escape from the hard
life of a squire? Shall I get back to see my wife and children?” To
which the answer came, “Thou shalt govern in thy house; and if thou
returnest to it thou shalt see thy wife and children; and on ceasing to
serve thou shalt cease to be a squire.”
</p>
<p>
“Good, by God!” said Sancho Panza; “I could have told
myself that; the prophet Perogrullo could have said no more.”
</p>
<p>
“What answer wouldst thou have, beast?” said Don Quixote;
“is it not enough that the replies this head has given suit the
questions put to it?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, it is enough,” said Sancho; “but I should have
liked it to have made itself plainer and told me more.”
</p>
<p>
The questions and answers came to an end here, but not the wonder with
which all were filled, except Don Antonio’s two friends who were in
the secret. This Cide Hamete Benengeli thought fit to reveal at once, not
to keep the world in suspense, fancying that the head had some strange
magical mystery in it. He says, therefore, that on the model of another
head, the work of an image maker, which he had seen at Madrid, Don Antonio
made this one at home for his own amusement and to astonish ignorant
people; and its mechanism was as follows. The table was of wood painted
and varnished to imitate jasper, and the pedestal on which it stood was of
the same material, with four eagles’ claws projecting from it to
support the weight more steadily. The head, which resembled a bust or
figure of a Roman emperor, and was coloured like bronze, was hollow
throughout, as was the table, into which it was fitted so exactly that no
trace of the joining was visible. The pedestal of the table was also
hollow and communicated with the throat and neck of the head, and the
whole was in communication with another room underneath the chamber in
which the head stood. Through the entire cavity in the pedestal, table,
throat and neck of the bust or figure, there passed a tube of tin
carefully adjusted and concealed from sight. In the room below
corresponding to the one above was placed the person who was to answer,
with his mouth to the tube, and the voice, as in an ear-trumpet, passed
from above downwards, and from below upwards, the words coming clearly and
distinctly; it was impossible, thus, to detect the trick. A nephew of Don
Antonio’s, a smart sharp-witted student, was the answerer, and as he
had been told beforehand by his uncle who the persons were that would come
with him that day into the chamber where the head was, it was an easy
matter for him to answer the first question at once and correctly; the
others he answered by guess-work, and, being clever, cleverly. Cide Hamete
adds that this marvellous contrivance stood for some ten or twelve days;
but that, as it became noised abroad through the city that he had in his
house an enchanted head that answered all who asked questions of it, Don
Antonio, fearing it might come to the ears of the watchful sentinels of
our faith, explained the matter to the inquisitors, who commanded him to
break it up and have done with it, lest the ignorant vulgar should be
scandalised. By Don Quixote, however, and by Sancho the head was still
held to be an enchanted one, and capable of answering questions, though
more to Don Quixote’s satisfaction than Sancho’s.
</p>
<p>
The gentlemen of the city, to gratify Don Antonio and also to do the
honours to Don Quixote, and give him an opportunity of displaying his
folly, made arrangements for a tilting at the ring in six days from that
time, which, however, for reason that will be mentioned hereafter, did not
take place.
</p>
<p>
Don Quixote took a fancy to stroll about the city quietly and on foot, for
he feared that if he went on horseback the boys would follow him; so he
and Sancho and two servants that Don Antonio gave him set out for a walk.
Thus it came to pass that going along one of the streets Don Quixote
lifted up his eyes and saw written in very large letters over a door,
“Books printed here,” at which he was vastly pleased, for
until then he had never seen a printing office, and he was curious to know
what it was like. He entered with all his following, and saw them drawing
sheets in one place, correcting in another, setting up type here, revising
there; in short all the work that is to be seen in great printing offices.
He went up to one case and asked what they were about there; the workmen
told him, he watched them with wonder, and passed on. He approached one
man, among others, and asked him what he was doing. The workman replied,
“Señor, this gentleman here” (pointing to a man of
prepossessing appearance and a certain gravity of look) “has
translated an Italian book into our Spanish tongue, and I am setting it up
in type for the press.”
</p>
<p>
“What is the title of the book?” asked Don Quixote; to which
the author replied, “Señor, in Italian the book is called <i>Le
Bagatelle</i>.”
</p>
<p>
“And what does <i>Le Bagatelle</i> import in our Spanish?” asked Don
Quixote.
</p>
<p>
“<i>Le Bagatelle</i>,” said the author, “is as though we should
say in Spanish <i>Los Juguetes;</i> but though the book is humble in name it has
good solid matter in it.”
</p>
<p>
“I,” said Don Quixote, “have some little smattering of
Italian, and I plume myself on singing some of Ariosto’s stanzas;
but tell me, señor—I do not say this to test your ability, but
merely out of curiosity—have you ever met with the word <i>pignatta</i> in
your book?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, often,” said the author.
</p>
<p>
“And how do you render that in Spanish?”
</p>
<p>
“How should I render it,” returned the author, “but by
<i>olla</i>?”
</p>
<p>
“Body o’ me,” exclaimed Don Quixote, “what a proficient
you are in the Italian language! I would lay a good wager that where they say
in Italian <i>piace</i> you say in Spanish <i>place</i>, and where they say
<i>piu</i> you say <i>mas</i>, and you translate <i>sù</i> by <i>arriba</i> and
<i>giù</i> by <i>abajo</i>.”
</p>
<p>
“I translate them so of course,” said the author, “for
those are their proper equivalents.”
</p>
<p>
“I would venture to swear,” said Don Quixote, “that your
worship is not known in the world, which always begrudges their reward to
rare wits and praiseworthy labours. What talents lie wasted there! What
genius thrust away into corners! What worth left neglected! Still it seems
to me that translation from one language into another, if it be not from
the queens of languages, the Greek and the Latin, is like looking at
Flemish tapestries on the wrong side; for though the figures are visible,
they are full of threads that make them indistinct, and they do not show
with the smoothness and brightness of the right side; and translation from
easy languages argues neither ingenuity nor command of words, any more
than transcribing or copying out one document from another. But I do not
mean by this to draw the inference that no credit is to be allowed for the
work of translating, for a man may employ himself in ways worse and less
profitable to himself. This estimate does not include two famous
translators, Doctor Cristóbal de Figueroa, in his <i>Pastor Fido</i>, and Don
Juan de Jáuregui, in his <i>Aminta</i>, wherein by their felicity they leave it
in doubt which is the translation and which the original. But tell me, are
you printing this book at your own risk, or have you sold the copyright to
some bookseller?”
</p>
<p>
“I print at my own risk,” said the author, “and I expect
to make a thousand ducats at least by this first edition, which is to be
of two thousand copies that will go off in a twinkling at six reals
apiece.”
</p>
<p>
“A fine calculation you are making!” said Don Quixote; “it
is plain you don’t know the ins and outs of the printers, and how
they play into one another’s hands. I promise you when you find
yourself saddled with two thousand copies you will feel so sore that it
will astonish you, particularly if the book is a little out of the common
and not in any way highly spiced.”
</p>
<p>
“What!” said the author, “would your worship, then, have
me give it to a bookseller who will give three maravedis for the copyright
and think he is doing me a favour? I do not print my books to win fame in
the world, for I am known in it already by my works; I want to make money,
without which reputation is not worth a rap.”
</p>
<p>
“God send your worship good luck,” said Don Quixote; and he
moved on to another case, where he saw them correcting a sheet of a book
with the title of “Light of the Soul;” noticing it he
observed, “Books like this, though there are many of the kind, are
the ones that deserve to be printed, for many are the sinners in these
days, and lights unnumbered are needed for all that are in darkness.”
</p>
<p>
He passed on, and saw they were also correcting another book, and when he
asked its title they told him it was called, “The Second Part of the
Ingenious Gentleman Don Quixote of La Mancha,” by one of
Tordesillas.
</p>
<p>
“I have heard of this book already,” said Don Quixote, “and
verily and on my conscience I thought it had been by this time burned to
ashes as a meddlesome intruder; but its Martinmas will come to it as it
does to every pig; for fictions have the more merit and charm about them
the more nearly they approach the truth or what looks like it; and true
stories, the truer they are the better they are;” and so saying he
walked out of the printing office with a certain amount of displeasure in
his looks. That same day Don Antonio arranged to take him to see the
galleys that lay at the beach, whereat Sancho was in high delight, as he
had never seen any all his life. Don Antonio sent word to the commandant
of the galleys that he intended to bring his guest, the famous Don Quixote
of La Mancha, of whom the commandant and all the citizens had already
heard, that afternoon to see them; and what happened on board of them will
be told in the next chapter.

<p>
Profound were Don Quixote’s reflections on the reply of the
enchanted head, not one of them, however, hitting on the secret of the
trick, but all concentrated on the promise, which he regarded as a
certainty, of Dulcinea’s disenchantment. This he turned over in his
mind again and again with great satisfaction, fully persuaded that he
would shortly see its fulfillment; and as for Sancho, though, as has been
said, he hated being a governor, still he had a longing to be giving
orders and finding himself obeyed once more; this is the misfortune that
being in authority, even in jest, brings with it.
</p>
<p>
To resume; that afternoon their host Don Antonio Moreno and his two
friends, with Don Quixote and Sancho, went to the galleys. The commandant
had been already made aware of his good fortune in seeing two such famous
persons as Don Quixote and Sancho, and the instant they came to the shore
all the galleys struck their awnings and the clarions rang out. A skiff
covered with rich carpets and cushions of crimson velvet was immediately
lowered into the water, and as Don Quixote stepped on board of it, the
leading galley fired her gangway gun, and the other galleys did the same;
and as he mounted the starboard ladder the whole crew saluted him (as is
the custom when a personage of distinction comes on board a galley) by
exclaiming “Hu, hu, hu,” three times. The general, for so we
shall call him, a Valencian gentleman of rank, gave him his hand and
embraced him, saying, “I shall mark this day with a white stone as
one of the happiest I can expect to enjoy in my lifetime, since I have
seen Señor Don Quixote of La Mancha, pattern and image wherein we see
contained and condensed all that is worthy in knight-errantry.”
</p>
<p>
Don Quixote delighted beyond measure with such a lordly reception, replied
to him in words no less courteous. All then proceeded to the poop, which
was very handsomely decorated, and seated themselves on the bulwark
benches; the boatswain passed along the gangway and piped all hands to
strip, which they did in an instant. Sancho, seeing such a number of men
stripped to the skin, was taken aback, and still more when he saw them
spread the awning so briskly that it seemed to him as if all the devils
were at work at it; but all this was cakes and fancy bread to what I am
going to tell now. Sancho was seated on the captain’s stage, close
to the aftermost rower on the right-hand side. He, previously instructed
in what he was to do, laid hold of Sancho, hoisting him up in his arms,
and the whole crew, who were standing ready, beginning on the right,
proceeded to pass him on, whirling him along from hand to hand and from
bench to bench with such rapidity that it took the sight out of poor
Sancho’s eyes, and he made quite sure that the devils themselves
were flying away with him; nor did they leave off with him until they had
sent him back along the left side and deposited him on the poop; and the
poor fellow was left bruised and breathless and all in a sweat, and unable
to comprehend what it was that had happened to him.
</p>
<p>
Don Quixote when he saw Sancho’s flight without wings asked the
general if this was a usual ceremony with those who came on board the
galleys for the first time; for, if so, as he had no intention of adopting
them as a profession, he had no mind to perform such feats of agility, and
if anyone offered to lay hold of him to whirl him about, he vowed to God
he would kick his soul out; and as he said this he stood up and clapped
his hand upon his sword. At this instant they struck the awning and
lowered the yard with a prodigious rattle. Sancho thought heaven was
coming off its hinges and going to fall on his head, and full of terror he
ducked it and buried it between his knees; nor were Don Quixote’s
knees altogether under control, for he too shook a little, squeezed his
shoulders together and lost colour. The crew then hoisted the yard with
the same rapidity and clatter as when they lowered it, all the while
keeping silence as though they had neither voice nor breath. The boatswain
gave the signal to weigh anchor, and leaping upon the middle of the
gangway began to lay on to the shoulders of the crew with his courbash or
whip, and to haul out gradually to sea.
</p>
<p>
When Sancho saw so many red feet (for such he took the oars to be) moving
all together, he said to himself, “It’s these that are the
real chanted things, and not the ones my master talks of. What can those
wretches have done to be so whipped; and how does that one man who goes
along there whistling dare to whip so many? I declare this is hell, or at
least purgatory!”
</p>
<p>
Don Quixote, observing how attentively Sancho regarded what was going on,
said to him, “Ah, Sancho my friend, how quickly and cheaply might
you finish off the disenchantment of Dulcinea, if you would strip to the
waist and take your place among those gentlemen! Amid the pain and
sufferings of so many you would not feel your own much; and moreover
perhaps the sage Merlin would allow each of these lashes, being laid on
with a good hand, to count for ten of those which you must give yourself
at last.”
</p>
<p>
The general was about to ask what these lashes were, and what was Dulcinea’s
disenchantment, when a sailor exclaimed, “Monjui signals that there
is an oared vessel off the coast to the west.”
</p>
<p>
On hearing this the general sprang upon the gangway crying, “Now
then, my sons, don’t let her give us the slip! It must be some
Algerine corsair brigantine that the watchtower signals to us.” The
three others immediately came alongside the chief galley to receive their
orders. The general ordered two to put out to sea while he with the other
kept in shore, so that in this way the vessel could not escape them. The
crews plied the oars driving the galleys so furiously that they seemed to
fly. The two that had put out to sea, after a couple of miles sighted a
vessel which, so far as they could make out, they judged to be one of
fourteen or fifteen banks, and so she proved. As soon as the vessel
discovered the galleys she went about with the object and in the hope of
making her escape by her speed; but the attempt failed, for the chief
galley was one of the fastest vessels afloat, and overhauled her so
rapidly that they on board the brigantine saw clearly there was no
possibility of escaping, and the rais therefore would have had them drop
their oars and give themselves up so as not to provoke the captain in
command of our galleys to anger. But chance, directing things otherwise,
so ordered it that just as the chief galley came close enough for those on
board the vessel to hear the shouts from her calling on them to surrender,
two Toraquis, that is to say two Turks, both drunken, that with a dozen
more were on board the brigantine, discharged their muskets, killing two
of the soldiers that lined the sides of our vessel. Seeing this the
general swore he would not leave one of those he found on board the vessel
alive, but as he bore down furiously upon her she slipped away from him
underneath the oars. The galley shot a good way ahead; those on board the
vessel saw their case was desperate, and while the galley was coming about
they made sail, and by sailing and rowing once more tried to sheer off;
but their activity did not do them as much good as their rashness did them
harm, for the galley coming up with them in a little more than half a mile
threw her oars over them and took the whole of them alive. The other two
galleys now joined company and all four returned with the prize to the
beach, where a vast multitude stood waiting for them, eager to see what
they brought back. The general anchored close in, and perceived that the
viceroy of the city was on the shore. He ordered the skiff to push off to
fetch him, and the yard to be lowered for the purpose of hanging forthwith
the rais and the rest of the men taken on board the vessel, about
six-and-thirty in number, all smart fellows and most of them Turkish
musketeers. He asked which was the rais of the brigantine, and was
answered in Spanish by one of the prisoners (who afterwards proved to be a
Spanish renegade), “This young man, señor, that you see here is our
rais,” and he pointed to one of the handsomest and most
gallant-looking youths that could be imagined. He did not seem to be
twenty years of age.
</p>
<p>
“Tell me, dog,” said the general, “what led thee to kill
my soldiers, when thou sawest it was impossible for thee to escape? Is
that the way to behave to chief galleys? Knowest thou not that rashness is
not valour? Faint prospects of success should make men bold, but not rash.”
</p>
<p>
The rais was about to reply, but the general could not at that moment
listen to him, as he had to hasten to receive the viceroy, who was now
coming on board the galley, and with him certain of his attendants and
some of the people.
</p>
<p>
“You have had a good chase, señor general,” said the viceroy.
</p>
<p>
“Your excellency shall soon see how good, by the game strung up to
this yard,” replied the general.
</p>
<p>
“How so?” returned the viceroy.
</p>
<p>
“Because,” said the general, “against all law, reason,
and usages of war they have killed on my hands two of the best soldiers on
board these galleys, and I have sworn to hang every man that I have taken,
but above all this youth who is the rais of the brigantine,” and he
pointed to him as he stood with his hands already bound and the rope round
his neck, ready for death.
</p>
<p>
The viceroy looked at him, and seeing him so well-favoured, so graceful,
and so submissive, he felt a desire to spare his life, the comeliness of
the youth furnishing him at once with a letter of recommendation. He
therefore questioned him, saying, “Tell me, rais, art thou Turk,
Moor, or renegade?”
</p>
<p>
To which the youth replied, also in Spanish, “I am neither Turk, nor
Moor, nor renegade.”

“What art thou, then?” said the viceroy.
</p>
<p>
“A Christian woman,” replied the youth.
</p>
<p>
“A woman and a Christian, in such a dress and in such circumstances!
It is more marvellous than credible,” said the viceroy.
</p>
<p>
“Suspend the execution of the sentence,” said the youth;
“your vengeance will not lose much by waiting while I tell you the
story of my life.”
</p>
<p>
What heart could be so hard as not to be softened by these words, at any
rate so far as to listen to what the unhappy youth had to say? The general
bade him say what he pleased, but not to expect pardon for his flagrant
offence. With this permission the youth began in these words.
</p>
<p>
“Born of Morisco parents, I am of that nation, more unhappy than
wise, upon which of late a sea of woes has poured down. In the course of
our misfortune I was carried to Barbary by two uncles of mine, for it was
in vain that I declared I was a Christian, as in fact I am, and not a mere
pretended one, or outwardly, but a true Catholic Christian. It availed me
nothing with those charged with our sad expatriation to protest this, nor
would my uncles believe it; on the contrary, they treated it as an untruth
and a subterfuge set up to enable me to remain behind in the land of my
birth; and so, more by force than of my own will, they took me with them.
I had a Christian mother, and a father who was a man of sound sense and a
Christian too; I imbibed the Catholic faith with my mother’s milk, I
was well brought up, and neither in word nor in deed did I, I think, show
any sign of being a Morisco. To accompany these virtues, for such I hold
them, my beauty, if I possess any, grew with my growth; and great as was
the seclusion in which I lived it was not so great but that a young
gentleman, Don Gaspar Gregorio by name, eldest son of a gentleman who is
lord of a village near ours, contrived to find opportunities of seeing me.
How he saw me, how we met, how his heart was lost to me, and mine not kept
from him, would take too long to tell, especially at a moment when I am in
dread of the cruel cord that threatens me interposing between tongue and
throat; I will only say, therefore, that Don Gregorio chose to accompany
me in our banishment. He joined company with the Moriscoes who were going
forth from other villages, for he knew their language very well, and on
the voyage he struck up a friendship with my two uncles who were carrying
me with them; for my father, like a wise and far-sighted man, as soon as
he heard the first edict for our expulsion, quitted the village and
departed in quest of some refuge for us abroad. He left hidden and buried,
at a spot of which I alone have knowledge, a large quantity of pearls and
precious stones of great value, together with a sum of money in gold
cruzadoes and doubloons. He charged me on no account to touch the
treasure, if by any chance they expelled us before his return. I obeyed
him, and with my uncles, as I have said, and others of our kindred and
neighbours, passed over to Barbary, and the place where we took up our
abode was Algiers, much the same as if we had taken it up in hell itself.
The king heard of my beauty, and report told him of my wealth, which was
in some degree fortunate for me. He summoned me before him, and asked me
what part of Spain I came from, and what money and jewels I had. I
mentioned the place, and told him the jewels and money were buried there;
but that they might easily be recovered if I myself went back for them.
All this I told him, in dread lest my beauty and not his own covetousness
should influence him. While he was engaged in conversation with me, they
brought him word that in company with me was one of the handsomest and
most graceful youths that could be imagined. I knew at once that they were
speaking of Don Gaspar Gregorio, whose comeliness surpasses the most
highly vaunted beauty. I was troubled when I thought of the danger he was
in, for among those barbarous Turks a fair youth is more esteemed than a
woman, be she ever so beautiful. The king immediately ordered him to be
brought before him that he might see him, and asked me if what they said
about the youth was true. I then, almost as if inspired by heaven, told
him it was, but that I would have him to know it was not a man, but a
woman like myself, and I entreated him to allow me to go and dress her in
the attire proper to her, so that her beauty might be seen to perfection,
and that she might present herself before him with less embarrassment. He
bade me go by all means, and said that the next day we should discuss the
plan to be adopted for my return to Spain to carry away the hidden
treasure. I saw Don Gaspar, I told him the danger he was in if he let it
be seen he was a man, I dressed him as a Moorish woman, and that same
afternoon I brought him before the king, who was charmed when he saw him,
and resolved to keep the damsel and make a present of her to the Grand
Signor; and to avoid the risk she might run among the women of his
seraglio, and distrustful of himself, he commanded her to be placed in the
house of some Moorish ladies of rank who would protect and attend to her;
and thither he was taken at once. What we both suffered (for I cannot deny
that I love him) may be left to the imagination of those who are separated
if they love one another dearly. The king then arranged that I should
return to Spain in this brigantine, and that two Turks, those who killed
your soldiers, should accompany me. There also came with me this Spanish
renegade”—and here she pointed to him who had first spoken—“whom
I know to be secretly a Christian, and to be more desirous of being left
in Spain than of returning to Barbary. The rest of the crew of the
brigantine are Moors and Turks, who merely serve as rowers. The two Turks,
greedy and insolent, instead of obeying the orders we had to land me and
this renegade in Christian dress (with which we came provided) on the
first Spanish ground we came to, chose to run along the coast and make
some prize if they could, fearing that if they put us ashore first, we
might, in case of some accident befalling us, make it known that the
brigantine was at sea, and thus, if there happened to be any galleys on
the coast, they might be taken. We sighted this shore last night, and
knowing nothing of these galleys, we were discovered, and the result was
what you have seen. To sum up, there is Don Gregorio in woman’s
dress, among women, in imminent danger of his life; and here am I, with
hands bound, in expectation, or rather in dread, of losing my life, of
which I am already weary. Here, sirs, ends my sad story, as true as it is
unhappy; all I ask of you is to allow me to die like a Christian, for, as
I have already said, I am not to be charged with the offence of which
those of my nation are guilty;” and she stood silent, her eyes
filled with moving tears, accompanied by plenty from the bystanders. The
viceroy, touched with compassion, went up to her without speaking and
untied the cord that bound the hands of the Moorish girl.
</p>
<p>
But all the while the Morisco Christian was telling her strange story, an
elderly pilgrim, who had come on board of the galley at the same time as
the viceroy, kept his eyes fixed upon her; and the instant she ceased
speaking he threw himself at her feet, and embracing them said in a voice
broken by sobs and sighs, “O Ana Felix, my unhappy daughter, I am
thy father Ricote, come back to look for thee, unable to live without
thee, my soul that thou art!”
</p>
<p>
At these words of his, Sancho opened his eyes and raised his head, which
he had been holding down, brooding over his unlucky excursion; and looking
at the pilgrim he recognised in him that same Ricote he met the day he
quitted his government, and felt satisfied that this was his daughter. She
being now unbound embraced her father, mingling her tears with his, while
he addressing the general and the viceroy said, “This, sirs, is my
daughter, more unhappy in her adventures than in her name. She is Ana
Felix, surnamed Ricote, celebrated as much for her own beauty as for my
wealth. I quitted my native land in search of some shelter or refuge for
us abroad, and having found one in Germany I returned in this pilgrim’s
dress, in the company of some other German pilgrims, to seek my daughter
and take up a large quantity of treasure I had left buried. My daughter I
did not find, the treasure I found and have with me; and now, in this
strange roundabout way you have seen, I find the treasure that more than
all makes me rich, my beloved daughter. If our innocence and her tears and
mine can with strict justice open the door to clemency, extend it to us,
for we never had any intention of injuring you, nor do we sympathise with
the aims of our people, who have been justly banished.”
</p>
<p>
“I know Ricote well,” said Sancho at this, “and I know
too that what he says about Ana Felix being his daughter is true; but as
to those other particulars about going and coming, and having good or bad
intentions, I say nothing.”
</p>
<p>
While all present stood amazed at this strange occurrence the general
said, “At any rate your tears will not allow me to keep my oath;
live, fair Ana Felix, all the years that heaven has allotted you; but
these rash insolent fellows must pay the penalty of the crime they have
committed;” and with that he gave orders to have the two Turks who
had killed his two soldiers hanged at once at the yard-arm. The viceroy,
however, begged him earnestly not to hang them, as their behaviour
savoured rather of madness than of bravado. The general yielded to the
viceroy’s request, for revenge is not easily taken in cold blood.
They then tried to devise some scheme for rescuing Don Gaspar Gregorio
from the danger in which he had been left. Ricote offered for that object
more than two thousand ducats that he had in pearls and gems; they
proposed several plans, but none so good as that suggested by the renegade
already mentioned, who offered to return to Algiers in a small vessel of
about six banks, manned by Christian rowers, as he knew where, how, and
when he could and should land, nor was he ignorant of the house in which
Don Gaspar was staying. The general and the viceroy had some hesitation
about placing confidence in the renegade and entrusting him with the
Christians who were to row, but Ana Felix said she could answer for him,
and her father offered to go and pay the ransom of the Christians if by
any chance they should not be forthcoming. This, then, being agreed upon,
the viceroy landed, and Don Antonio Moreno took the fair Morisco and her
father home with him, the viceroy charging him to give them the best
reception and welcome in his power, while on his own part he offered all
that house contained for their entertainment; so great was the good-will
and kindliness the beauty of Ana Felix had infused into his heart.

<p>
The wife of Don Antonio Moreno, so the history says, was extremely happy
to see Ana Felix in her house. She welcomed her with great kindness,
charmed as well by her beauty as by her intelligence; for in both respects
the fair Morisco was richly endowed, and all the people of the city
flocked to see her as though they had been summoned by the ringing of the
bells.
</p>
<p>
Don Quixote told Don Antonio that the plan adopted for releasing Don
Gregorio was not a good one, for its risks were greater than its
advantages, and that it would be better to land himself with his arms and
horse in Barbary; for he would carry him off in spite of the whole Moorish
host, as Don Gaiferos carried off his wife Melisendra.
</p>
<p>
“Remember, your worship,” observed Sancho on hearing him say
so, “Señor Don Gaiferos carried off his wife from the mainland, and
took her to France by land; but in this case, if by chance we carry off
Don Gregorio, we have no way of bringing him to Spain, for there’s
the sea between.”
</p>
<p>
“There’s a remedy for everything except death,” said Don
Quixote; “if they bring the vessel close to the shore we shall be
able to get on board though all the world strive to prevent us.”
</p>
<p>
“Your worship hits it off mighty well and mighty easy,” said
Sancho; “but ‘it’s a long step from saying to doing;’
and I hold to the renegade, for he seems to me an honest good-hearted
fellow.”
</p>
<p>
Don Antonio then said that if the renegade did not prove successful, the
expedient of the great Don Quixote’s expedition to Barbary should be
adopted. Two days afterwards the renegade put to sea in a light vessel of
six oars a-side manned by a stout crew, and two days later the galleys
made sail eastward, the general having begged the viceroy to let him know
all about the release of Don Gregorio and about Ana Felix, and the viceroy
promised to do as he requested.
</p>
<p>
One morning as Don Quixote went out for a stroll along the beach, arrayed
in full armour (for, as he often said, that was “his only gear, his
only rest the fray,” and he never was without it for a moment), he
saw coming towards him a knight, also in full armour, with a shining moon
painted on his shield, who, on approaching sufficiently near to be heard,
said in a loud voice, addressing himself to Don Quixote, “Illustrious
knight, and never sufficiently extolled Don Quixote of La Mancha, I am the
Knight of the White Moon, whose unheard-of achievements will perhaps have
recalled him to thy memory. I come to do battle with thee and prove the
might of thy arm, to the end that I make thee acknowledge and confess that
my lady, let her be who she may, is incomparably fairer than thy Dulcinea
del Toboso. If thou dost acknowledge this fairly and openly, thou shalt
escape death and save me the trouble of inflicting it upon thee; if thou
fightest and I vanquish thee, I demand no other satisfaction than that,
laying aside arms and abstaining from going in quest of adventures, thou
withdraw and betake thyself to thine own village for the space of a year,
and live there without putting hand to sword, in peace and quiet and
beneficial repose, the same being needful for the increase of thy
substance and the salvation of thy soul; and if thou dost vanquish me, my
head shall be at thy disposal, my arms and horse thy spoils, and the
renown of my deeds transferred and added to thine. Consider which will be
thy best course, and give me thy answer speedily, for this day is all the
time I have for the despatch of this business.”
</p>
<p>
Don Quixote was amazed and astonished, as well at the Knight of the White
Moon’s arrogance, as at his reason for delivering the defiance, and
with calm dignity he answered him, “Knight of the White Moon, of
whose achievements I have never heard until now, I will venture to swear
you have never seen the illustrious Dulcinea; for had you seen her I know
you would have taken care not to venture yourself upon this issue, because
the sight would have removed all doubt from your mind that there ever has
been or can be a beauty to be compared with hers; and so, not saying you
lie, but merely that you are not correct in what you state, I accept your
challenge, with the conditions you have proposed, and at once, that the
day you have fixed may not expire; and from your conditions I except only
that of the renown of your achievements being transferred to me, for I
know not of what sort they are nor what they may amount to; I am satisfied
with my own, such as they be. Take, therefore, the side of the field you
choose, and I will do the same; and to whom God shall give it may Saint
Peter add his blessing.”
</p>
<p>
The Knight of the White Moon had been seen from the city, and it was told
the viceroy how he was in conversation with Don Quixote. The viceroy,
fancying it must be some fresh adventure got up by Don Antonio Moreno or
some other gentleman of the city, hurried out at once to the beach
accompanied by Don Antonio and several other gentlemen, just as Don
Quixote was wheeling Rocinante round in order to take up the necessary
distance. The viceroy upon this, seeing that the pair of them were
evidently preparing to come to the charge, put himself between them,
asking them what it was that led them to engage in combat all of a sudden
in this way. The Knight of the White Moon replied that it was a question
of precedence of beauty; and briefly told him what he had said to Don
Quixote, and how the conditions of the defiance agreed upon on both sides
had been accepted. The viceroy went over to Don Antonio, and asked in a
low voice did he know who the Knight of the White Moon was, or was it some
joke they were playing on Don Quixote. Don Antonio replied that he neither
knew who he was nor whether the defiance was in joke or in earnest. This
answer left the viceroy in a state of perplexity, not knowing whether he
ought to let the combat go on or not; but unable to persuade himself that
it was anything but a joke he fell back, saying, “If there be no
other way out of it, gallant knights, except to confess or die, and Don
Quixote is inflexible, and your worship of the White Moon still more so,
in God’s hand be it, and fall on.”
</p>
<p>
He of the White Moon thanked the viceroy in courteous and well-chosen
words for the permission he gave them, and so did Don Quixote, who then,
commending himself with all his heart to heaven and to his Dulcinea, as
was his custom on the eve of any combat that awaited him, proceeded to
take a little more distance, as he saw his antagonist was doing the same;
then, without blast of trumpet or other warlike instrument to give them
the signal to charge, both at the same instant wheeled their horses; and
he of the White Moon, being the swifter, met Don Quixote after having
traversed two-thirds of the course, and there encountered him with such
violence that, without touching him with his lance (for he held it high,
to all appearance purposely), he hurled Don Quixote and Rocinante to the
earth, a perilous fall. He sprang upon him at once, and placing the lance
over his visor said to him, “You are vanquished, sir knight, nay
dead unless you admit the conditions of our defiance.”
</p>
<p>
Don Quixote, bruised and stupefied, without raising his visor said in a
weak feeble voice as if he were speaking out of a tomb, “Dulcinea
del Toboso is the fairest woman in the world, and I the most unfortunate
knight on earth; it is not fitting that this truth should suffer by my
feebleness; drive your lance home, sir knight, and take my life, since you
have taken away my honour.”
</p>
<p>
“That will I not, in sooth,” said he of the White Moon;
“live the fame of the lady Dulcinea’s beauty undimmed as ever;
all I require is that the great Don Quixote retire to his own home for a
year, or for so long a time as shall by me be enjoined upon him, as we
agreed before engaging in this combat.”
</p>
<p>
The viceroy, Don Antonio, and several others who were present heard all
this, and heard too how Don Quixote replied that so long as nothing in
prejudice of Dulcinea was demanded of him, he would observe all the rest
like a true and loyal knight. The engagement given, he of the White Moon
wheeled about, and making obeisance to the viceroy with a movement of the
head, rode away into the city at a half gallop. The viceroy bade Don
Antonio hasten after him, and by some means or other find out who he was.
They raised Don Quixote up and uncovered his face, and found him pale and
bathed with sweat.

<p>
Rocinante from the mere hard measure he had received lay unable to stir
for the present. Sancho, wholly dejected and woebegone, knew not what to
say or do. He fancied that all was a dream, that the whole business was a
piece of enchantment. Here was his master defeated, and bound not to take
up arms for a year. He saw the light of the glory of his achievements
obscured; the hopes of the promises lately made him swept away like smoke
before the wind; Rocinante, he feared, was crippled for life, and his
master’s bones out of joint; for if he were only shaken out of his
madness it would be no small luck. In the end they carried him into the
city in a hand-chair which the viceroy sent for, and thither the viceroy
himself returned, eager to ascertain who this Knight of the White Moon was
who had left Don Quixote in such a sad plight.
