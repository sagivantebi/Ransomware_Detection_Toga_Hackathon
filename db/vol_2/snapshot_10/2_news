Oh no, not again. Remember last time, when the number of articles complaining
about ST articles outnumbered the articles concerned (and every other single
type of article as well)?

There is a ST group, but not for "all of us". Some of us can't get at it. But
your point about headers is valid. In the interests of preventing Flame War III
I suggest that those of us who wish to put ST (and Dr. Who, etc) articles here
make sure that "ST" (or Dr. Who, etc) or some similar warning appears in the
header. And those who wish to complain about such postings should also always
put some clear warning in the header, so those of us who aren't interested can
kill their articles easily.

A long time ago I read about a program developed at MIT that produced
images of the way ordinary scenes (a street) would look at speeds nearing
c. I don't know if it used a plotter or calligraphic display, but it was
so long ago that whatever it did should surely be possible now in real time
on a Mac or equivalent. Does anything like that exist? - a sort of flight
simulator for cosmic ray particles, that would let you define a scene
with a 3D graphics editor and then look at it at various fractions of c.
(Colour would be a nice optional extra). The MIT program produced weirdly
drooping lampposts.
More ambitiously: what about general relativity? Here I am thinking about
some of the descriptions in Kaufmann's "The Cosmic Frontiers of General
Relativity" about how the world would look from near a black hole.

Multilink will allow several serial screens to run dos programs.

More info from:
	The Software Link
	3577 Parkway Lane
	Atlanta  GA 30092
	(404) 448 5465

They also have a product call PC-MOS that does the same thing on
386 boxes.  

Other software that lets you run multi user dos includes QNX,
Concurrent DOS (from Digital Research - remember CP/M :-),
Xenix (vp/ix comming soon), Unix V (ISC and Microport, with
vp/ix and locus merge respectivly).

Disclaimer: I don't sell any of the above - just write serial
driver's for them - not easy in some cases :-(

The conditional statement on the lines 161/162 "if ( base == BLOCK  &&
	n->lex_level < ( (Pfct(expand_fn->tp)->memof) ? 3 : 2 ) )"
in file expand.c has to be changed in:
"if (  base == BLOCK && n->lex_level < 'function-defined-in-class' ? 3 : 2  )".

For a function defined in a class the lex_level is raised by the curly brace
of the class itself. Not only member functions (memof = member of) can be
defined inline, friends can also.
(Note that funny declarations of local variables did appear in case a member
function which needs locals is declared inline but not defined in the class
itself).

The most simple way to tell whether a function is defined in a class is the
use of a global variable (the more globals the more fun), set and reset 
(embracing the first loop) in the routine classdef::simpl() in file simpl.c

This is only partly true.

"K.u.K." is short for "Kaiserlich und Koeniglich", that's right.
But it has nothing to do with the king of prussia.

At the time "K.u.K." was used, the king of Austria was also the
king of Hungary and the emperor of "Oestreich-Ungarn" (Austria and
Hungary. When thinking of K.u.K., I have the picture of
Kaiser Franz Josef, a fatherly man who kept his nation in a long
period of prosperous (sp?) peace, especially good for the arts.

BTW, Otto von Bismarck is remembered as a man who united Germany
(with an iron hand, that's true), which at that time was divided
into many small parts, all of them having a duke, different legislation
and borders between them. This meant having to pay customs very often,
thus disallowing free trade, which in turn was necessary for the
upcoming industrial revolution. So you might regard OvB a good statesman.

FOLDRXXX starts up with a little table of ROM versions and corresponding
to each version an address. At that address it inserts a list of memory
pieces to be used. If you use new ROM's these addresses have been changed
so you cannot use FOLDRXXX unless you figure out the new address you need
and substitute the necessary information into the binary of FOLDRXXX ( or
a disassembly ). On the other hand: the new version of the ROMs for the
Mega has a much larger OSpool from which these memory blocks are taken.
It used to be 6000 bytes, but the new size is 16000 bytes. I don't know
whether this makes FOLDRXXX superfluous. Maybe Allan Pratt can comment
on that.

This is correct, but the way the proof is written is not easy to understand. I
give below another proof.

For n>0 let

T(n) = x^a(n)/n^3	and 	U(n) = T(3n) + T(3n+1) + T(3n+2)

and for k>=0 let

Z(k) = sum {n=3^k to 3^(k+1)-1} T(n)

We have

Z(k+1)	= sum {n=3^(k+1) to 3^(k+2)-1} T(n)
	= sum {n=3^k to 3^(k+1)-1} [T(3n) + T(3n+1) + T(3n+2)]
	= sum {n=3^k to 3^(k+1)-1} U(n)

Let us compare U(n) to T(n). We have a(3n)=a(n)+1 and a(3n+1)=a(3n+2)=a(n).
Thus

U(n) = x^[a(n)+1]/(3n)^3 + x^a(n)/(3n+1)^3 + x^a(n)/(3n+2)^3

and so U(n) has as upper bound

x^a(n) * (x+2)/(3n)^3 = T(n) * (x+2)/27

and as lower bound

x^a(n) * (x+2)/(3n+2)^3 = T(n) * (x+2)/(3+2/n)^3

in other words U(n) = T(n) * (x+2)/(27+e(n)), where e(n)<(3+2/n)^3-27 tends to
0 when n tends to infinity. It follows then that

Z(k+1)= Z(k)*(x+2)/(27+f(k))

where f(k)<(3+2/3^k)^3-27 tends to 0 for n tending to infinity.

Now the series is the sum of all Z(k). Thus for x>25 we have Z(k+1)>Z(k) for k
large enough, and the series diverges; for x<25 we have Z(k+1)< r * Z(k) (with
r=(x+2)/27<1) for every k, and the series converges. For x=25 the series
diverges too (I think so), because Z(k+1)/Z(k) tends to 1 for k tending to
infinity.

We recently acquired some Western Digital EtherCard PLUS cards for IBM PC's.
We were planning to write MINIX drivers for them and we wanted the hardware
documentation from the supplier. We were indeed promised that.
However, as one might expect, we only got the documentation that stated
where to plug in the cable, and we are more interested in which IO-ports there
are, and what they do. Our supplier is not very helpful at the moment.

We will continue to nag our supplier, but in the meantime, does anyone have
the hardware info on this board?
We know there is a NatSemi DP8390 on there, and we have the datasheet on that
one, but there should also be an Ethernet Address Rom, plus some other things
on the board.

As they say, thanks in advance.

If you want dump to read the output from e.g. yes(1)
then you'll have to use a pty(4).

You should arrange that this pty is the control terminal of the
dump program and then write (redirect) the output of yes(1) to the pty.

Setting the control terminal of dump is done by writing a program which:

A) Removes the association with its control terminal by:

   ioctl(f, TIOCNOTTY, 0);

B) Opens the pty.

C) Exec's the dump program.

The above applies to Berkeley Unix 4.X

That reminds me to the goold old days, when PDP-11's ran only RSX,
RT-11 or RSTS. Sysmac.sml is a macro library, which contains the definitions
for the RT-11 "Programmed Requests" (nowadays known as system calls).
Don't think it's equivalent exists on Unix ...

Here's the makefile that I used to get Nethack up under MSC 4.0... NB: the
CFLAGS macro and the link command.  I was able to play a couple of levels
without stack errors or hangups, however there are some problems,
(everything seems to be identified, inventory not displayed correctly,
color not quite right (but overall it works)) so i did not "install" it.

This is a bit of a flame, which I hope does not upset some people
too much. I have tried sending the comments privately, but have had
no reply.
I got a Kinetics internal Ethernet interface for a Mac SE, plus the
ethernet driver, test software and NCSA telnet version 1.12.
In order to try out this software in a safe manner I created a mini-
-Ethernet with the Mac and an Ethernet monitor. Am I glad that I did
this!
The test software, when run, tends to throw out a large number of
broadcast packets in a very short space of time. Sometimes one can
control the frequency, other times not. At least one test threw out
about 200 broadcast packets in much less than one second. If I had
been on the real CERN Ethernet then a few hundred users would have
had to deal with these!
FLAME ON
When will people writing test software avoid the intensive use of
broadcast packets? Multicast would be slightly better, but even then
the software should establish the address of those other computers
with which it can run a test, and then address them directly.
FLAME OFF (for a while)
I then tried to run NCSA telnet. This also started out with about
70 immediate broadcasts. These started out with a set of three
types of broadcast:
  1. arp with source ip address 0.0.0.255, looking for 0.0.0.127
  2. something with type field 80f3 (what the hell is this?)
  3. some other arp-type (type field 809b) with sender as 0.0.0.127
These three are repeated about 20 times at intervals of about
10 milliseconds (yes, milliseconds!). There are then a few more type
809b broadcasts at reasonable (a few hundred milliseconds!) intervals
before telnet starts to arp for the real host that I asked for.
FLAME ON
Why does software often insist on repeating packets at very short
intervals on vey reliable LANs (and have you seen the Sun lately!)?
FLAME OFF
Despite all the above, I waited for a quiet moment before connecting
onto the real Ethernet. I then tried telnet to our Ultrix Vax.
Immediate remark: keyboard in application mode does not work for us.
I then thought to run the vt100 test program (which some of you might
also have picked up off usenet). What a disaster: the emulation fails
all over the place!
Never mind, let us see if I can connect to our IBM VM system. Of course,
I have to go via a Spartacus KNET, because there is no NCSA tn3270
(is anyone working on this?). Complete failure: Spartacus has a bit of
a peculiar telnet setup (though Ultrix, bsd4.2 and FTP Inc. telnet on
a PC work fine) which seems to screw NCSA telnet.
Final try: go through an IBM 7171 front-end, which has 3270 to VT100
built in. Sort of works (using ESC n for PF key n), but since the
application keypad mode fails there is no way that I could get PA2
for clear screen. Merde (which the French will understand.
FLAME ON
I know that NCSA is now at version 2.0. Why did I get version 1.12
from Kinetics? (and why must only a Kinetics agent modify their Mac SCSI
box for a European power supply?). How do I get an updated version
quickly (no, I cannot do anonymous FTP!). Why have these simple tests
never been reported before? etc. etc.
FLAME OFF
I would be delighted if someone could tell me that all the above problems
are fixed in the current release!

I've neither encountered that bug, nor did I first get the key. There's a lot

Same problem here. I noticed that strange Find bug too. My
solution is a real kludge, but it works.

Instead of issuing the FIND command in script, TYPE the FIND command
with all the arguments into the message box and then (again
from script) add a return. Like:

on mouseUp
   type "FIND" && quote & key & quote && "in background field id" && number &
   return
end mouseUp

This also makes the repeated FIND easier.

I made a stack that needed a search option on partial keys. So I wanted
HC to keep on looking when the user stated that the item found wasn't
the right one.

I made a script to do this (if interested I can mail/post it) that
expects a second field for every field to be looked in. The item found
is put in the second field (named something like showName). When
the user says he wants to keep on searching, the next item found is
compared to the contents of showName. If it's the same, my script
says that 'it's all there is'. And cancels the search. Otherwise
a repeated search would be impossible.

If you like I can upload the lot. To comp.sys.mac.hypercard maybe?

To Apple:
Why do you reply to all the easy answers in comp.sys.mac.hypercard
bu happily skip all the possibly difficult ones? Seems like
the HyperCard group chooses the easy way out. Too many bugs in HC
perhaps?

And it slows down the 68881 by about 50%. Can anyone else verify this?
I moved to TMON mainly because it does not affect the speed of my Mac.

I hope none of the Byte or MacTutor benchmarks were run under MacsBug.

Still, ES works better in MacsBug than it does in TMON.

I seem to recall having seen a statement like "since <one of
those sub-classes  -  I forget which> has no prime requisite,
you can't switch to/from it." The implication being that any of
the sub-classes that require more than one minimum is out as
regards dual-class characters. So you could be a "fighter-turned-
magician" but not a "ranger-turned-magician". I think it was in
one of THE BOOKS, but I'm not certain. One thing you could do
is to require 15 or 17 in ALL the requisites with minimums.
That will restrict the number of assasin/illusionists!!!

Consider the following variant of Maxwell's daemon:

You have the following two items:
    1) a metal block,
    2) a bowl with a liquid.
Both items have the same temperature and are placed close together, they
may, however, be thermally isolated from one another.

Now into the bowl you drop a very small magnet. The motion of the
molecules in the liquid will cause the magnet to move slightly. This
will induce a (very small) current in the metal block. This current will
cause the temperature of the metal block to rise. The current will also
try to stop the movements of the magnet; this will in turn slow down the
motion of the molecules, and the liquid will cool.

The result: The metal block will grow warmer and warmer, and the liquid
will grow colder and colder.

This contradicts the second law of thermodynamics, and has the "advantage"
over Maxwell's daemon that no intelligence is involved.

What is wrong with the above argument?

So he is the one being guilty to it all. Grr. You see, in Sweden 
"progressive" music had nothing to do with the music. When we speak -
or spoke at that time - of "progressive" groups, we talked of groups
that played quite regular rock or pop. There were just one difference
to the ordinary hit music, the lyrics. They were naive, trivial and 
uttermost boring political texts of a communistic nature. (Which does
not imply that they were paid by KGB or something.) I must admit I 
didn't listen to much to them, their proganda was too much for me.

Now, this kind of people dominated this non-profit companies that Bjorn
talked of. For them ideological purity was much more important than
interesting than good music. Not to be denied, *some* good music was 
actually released on Silence and MNW (the other big non-profit), but 
also a lot of true crap. And I can easily imagine that groups with
interesting music was refused beacuse they voted with the wrong party.
(They would never have released Yes, that are right wing if anything.)

Finally, I should admit that despite the poorness of Silence, they
had the most interesting music in Sweden at that time. But that more
gives an indication of bad the rest was. (Abba, do you remember?)

The lastest version of GEMBOOT which was distributed something like
half a year ago, allows you to set the location of the sole undocumented
variable that Konrad uses in GEMBOOT. Matter of fact I used GEMBOOT
without problems on one of the first Mega's that arrived in Switzerland
after changing the GEMBOOT startup file.

Hmmmm, as Landon Dyer once said (a long time ago) FOLDRXXX does NOT fix
the other problem with GEMDOS management of the internal directory
list (mutiple bad copies of the same block), GEMBOOT does provide
a workaround  for this problem (so I wouldn't trust FOLDRXXX) plus
a lot of other nice things.

Something else to watch out for. The recently concluded
series "Knights of God" on independant television was
notable only for having Gareth Thomas (Blake himself) playing
the part of the leader of a band of rebels trying to
overthrow the harsh Goverment sometime in the future UK.
Almost a reprise of his part as blake, but he isn't even
one of the major characters. His name comes about eighth
on the credits.

Now we know what he was doing while he was missing from
Blake's Seven. :->

Also look out for the second Dr Who, Patrick Troughton, in a
supporting role.

Note: I do Not recommend this series for any other reson
than the above mentioned curiosity value.

ML gives you objects with modifiable state, so that you don't need to
pass a state structure around with you. The disadvantage, of course, is
that you smash the applicative behaviour of the language -
whether it's worth it depends what you're trying to do.
   Another way around this is to use type abstraction. That way, your
state structure is an abstract object with a few access functions to get
at the bits you need. I've always used the former approach, so I don't know
how far the latter approach gets you. It's quite possible to take non-
applicative features like assignment and abstract over them to build
structured objects with varying state, a la Smalltalk perhaps. This isn't
"dirty" functional programming - it's just using a functional language as if
it were a language of a different kind. I recently dedicated a lecture to the
structured use of side-effects in ML.
   By the way, I have various little typecheckers and interpreters for tiny
functional languages lying around on-line somewhere, if you're interested.
All written in ML, of course.

I recently read a report from a British music journalist visiting Roland in

a rack-mount box with the same sorts of features as the MT-32 but aimed a

I have implemented, as an extension to the "VT100" option, some extra
code to allow uEmacs to recognise the top, left and right function keys
on Sun 3 consoles.  ( I imagine they will work on Sun 2s as well). 

These keys, except for the cursor keys (R8,R10,R12 & R14), return a
string of the form <ESC>[ followed by 3 digits followed by 'z'.  By
interpreting the digits as an integer, and subtracting 128 to get a
character, all the function keys can be made to simulate 'FN?' keys. 
Which they return depends on how the Sun keyboard is set up (with
setkeys(1)). 

They won't work if you use Sun-windows and have a .ttyswrc file.

Anyway - Here are the diffs:

Having observed chat about the American Max series and comparisons with the
UK series, I would like to point out that we (in the
UK) have only seen the Pilot in
terms of an action/adventure episode. Our Max series have really featured
Max as a video DJ, and later as a talk show host.

So, I have kept silent till now, but I reckon the action/adventure series
you guys in the US of A are discussing must be worth watching! Anyone care
to hazard a guess as to why we in the UK don't get your Max show; and
do you get ours?

I guess this resolves into two questions: does it exist, and if it does,

About ten years ago I got a second hand copy of "UFO 1: Flesh Hunters" by

Well, several other forms of explanation, I guess.  This one confused me,
and I *understand* the address of an array. (Just teasing)

To put it another way....

Any object, of any type (integer, structure, array, etc.), has an address.
Usually, if it is an object that occupies several words of memory, it is the
address at which it begins. (Compiler theorists may be itching to tell me it
might mean something else entirely; let's keep this simple.)  The address of
an object is the compiler's handle for manipulating it.   You think of an
object by its name; the compiler "thinks" of it by its address.

The "address of an array" is the address that the compiler uses to access
that array and to calculate the position of any element in the array.

In C,  the address of an array is the same as the address of its first
element (array[0]).  If you want to set up a pointer to the array, you
get its address simply by naming it. Hence:

	pa = array;	/* pa now contains the address of "array" */

which is exactly the same as

	pa = &array[0]; /* "&" means "address of", so pa contains the
				address of element [0] of "array" */

Now this is a slight quirk in C - the name of the array being a synonym for
its address;  for any other object (notably a struct) that is not true.  If
you want the address of a structure you must write

	ps = &mystruct;	/* NOT ps = mystruct */

So we get back to the discussion from whence we came: why can't we be
consistent and get the address of an array by

	pa = &array;	?

To which the answer is:  you can, with some compilers.

The outputs in line 75 are alright, but those in line 100 aren't.
Only blank lines appear there.

I found out that if you change line 70 to 'IN$(Z%) = LEFT$(I$, 20%)'
- which does nearly nothing different - it works correctly.

Does anybody know a patch for this bug? Or does anybody know how to
avoid this in an other way?

Thanks in advance

Hold on, isn't this statement a bit too strong? The answer to which method
should be used ultimately depends on what the purpose of the estimations
is. 

In fact, if the purpose is to estimate y for a given x, then ordinary
least squares will do. In this case one is not really interested in
getting the best estimates of the parameters but only in getting a good
prediction.

I claim that there are very few regression examples where one really
cares whether or not the parameters are biased. In the large majority of
cases one is much more interested in the goodness of prediction. In this
case, one is interested in E[Y|X]. So if we model this quantity as
linear in X, then the OLS estimates are BLUE. This will also give
variances etc, all valid conditionally on X.

It is my feeling that a lot of books overemphasize the so-called bias,
since that is very often totally irrelevant.  For example, some
textbooks talk about biased parameter estimates when some variables
are missing in a multiple regression. In reality OLS is estimating a
better set of parameters than would the corresponding "unbiased"
estimator (OLS in this case will give an unbiased estimate of the best
surface based on the reduced set of variables). Certainly in this case,
one can make a strong argument that all the talk about biasses is
totally irrelevant.

Of course if the true purpose is to estimate parameters, e.g. to assess
the effect of a change in X on Y, then indeed one needs to worry a bit
about the effects of X being random.

There are, as you've guessed several papers in computational geometry
on line segment intersections.  You may look at the books by Shamos
and Preparata, and also the book by Edelsbrunner for references.

My favorite method to solve your problem though is an excellent
method invented by Randolph Franklin at RPI.  It is called ''adaptive
grid'' and works as follows.  First you overlay a regular, say G by G
integer grid on your scene.  Then you enter your edges into respective
cells of the grid  (similar to the bucketing idea!)  Then you make a pass
thru all the cells and find the intersections in each cell.  If an
intersection falls on a grid cell boundary you should be careful to
treat it so the integrity is kept intact.

I'm not very good in describing things in a hurry (especially Email)
but let me tell that I've wide experience with this stuff and it works
very well.  It is especially excellent for a scene made of short edges
with a rather homogeneous distribution.  Write me for details.
Also you may try Franklin at franklin@csv.rpi.edu.  Here is a short bibl.

Uhm, yes, unfortunately I find the 'feature' quite unusable.
I *never* come up with the correct sequence of == and @@, so I have to type
the command three times before I get it right. (really retype, that is.
'History mechanism' is something primos has never heard about).

I definitely prefer
for i in *.[ch]; do
    diff old/$i $i >$i.diff
done

(and you can add an 'if [ -d $i ]' if you really care about directories
ending in .c or .h. I don't, because I don't *have* directories ending
in .c or .h).

And, to continue some gripes on primos wildcards:
- I would expect them to work *always*. I.e. if I do
  TYPE @@
  (TYPE is primos echo) I would expect a list of all files, *not* '@@'.
- If I want all arguments on one line, and I use [WILD @@.TMP], and the
  result doesn't fit in 80 characters, I DO DEFINITELY NOT WANT IT TO TRUNCATE
  IT AT EIGHTY CHARS! I lost an important file that way: it was trying
  to generate a list containing PRECIOUSFILE.TMP, but, unfortunately,
  the .TMP started at position 81. So, it removed PRECIOUSFILE in stead.
  sigh.
  
Sorry, there are some neat ideas in primos, but the command processor and
it's wildcards is definitely *not* one of them.

Hi everybody !

I'm a final year student at Edinburgh University and as part of my final
year project I am using NeWS to build up a document composition system.
Alas, I'm new to NeWS and the NeWS manual does seem to be rather sketchy,
especially when it comes to using the CPS interface.

Having had a look at the stuff that is floating around in this newsgroup
I think that someone out there will be able to help me.

Point 1 : How can I control the litewin.ps and litemenu.ps packages through
          the CPS interface - especially, how do I get notification to the
          C program that something is happening ?

Point 2 : This may be trivial, but when I create an overlay for the purposes
          of rubber-banding, using the getclick family of operators, I can
          never get the overlay to disappear again. What is happening and 
          how should it be done ?

If these points have already been raised in the past then I will be happy to
receive direct e-mail from anybody who can answer any part of the above
queries.

As they say: When the going gets tough, I get the hell out of it !

If you try to force feed MINIX from an Ethernet at 10 Mbps it will probably
drop stuff.  There is undoubtedly a limit on how many interrupts per second
it can handle, but an AT it should be over 1000 per second.

The original tty driver was very carefully written to deal with exactly
this issue.  When characters come in, they are buffered, even if it is
not possible to send a message to the tty task.  This code is on lines
3528 to 3552 of the book.  Assuming you are still using this mechanism,
you ought to be able to accept characters at say 2400 baud without losing
any.

in stock.  If it is of any consolation to the people who have had to wait
and wait and wait, one of the corporate vice presidents was so unhappy
about the poor service to customers that he fired the person who was in charge
of managing the MINIX inventory.  He has been replaced by someone else who has

Here is a self-replicating Pascal program I wrote a few years ago.
The program looks dirty but it works !

program self (output);                                     
var i,j: integer;

  a[6] := 'for j := 1 to 59 do begin write(a[i][j]);if a[i][j]=chr(39)';
  a[7] := 'then write(a[i][j]) end; writeln(chr(39),'';'') end;         ';

You could the same thing without changing your AUTOEXEC.BAT. With the solution
presented above you will execute the same second version of AUTOEXEC.BAT each
time you reboot your machine (perhaps that's really what you want, but my
imagination doesn't go that far. If so, just disregard this article).

My solution: In the startup file you include the following:

if exist <filename_like_gaga.gag_or_whatever_you_want_to_call_it> goto second
<here included all the stuff you want executed when booted for the first time>
echo gaga > <filename_like_gaga.gag_or_whatever_you_want_to_call_it>
:second
<now follows the rest of the story (i.e. your autoexec.ddd)>

That's it. If you want to toggle between the two boot modes just add a line
like:

del <filename_like_gaga.gag_or_whatever_you_want_to_call_it>


		I hope this will help anybody :-)

I have a program written in MSC (parts coded with MASM) which does
quite nice things with grapichs but suffers lack of characters.
According to my knowledge the only way to get characters in Herc graphic

 I'm thinking of getting one of those new sampled pianos and would like
to get som info. From the net and from my own experience in my local
piano store, I've understood that the Yamaha Clavinova CLP 300 is
a pretty good choise. But I seem to remember a rumor about something
called Yamaha pf85 wich would be some kind of stageversion of the CLP 300.
Has anyone seen it, played it, compared it with the CLP 300? What are the
differences in price, sound, keyboard?

My local pianopusher here in Sweden hadn't heard of it. Is this because
it is so new or because it is a local phenomenon in the states?

>From looking at the BSD4.3 sources I found out the following:
When a tty is opened the associated process group is set to
that of the creator. The signals that the tty driver generate (e.g. caused
by ^C) are sent to this process group.

However, for sockets (a pipe is implemented as a pair of sockets in BSD4.3
and maybe elsewhere!) the associated process group is not set automatically.

So what you have to do is to set it before you can get ant SIGIO's! Use
   int pgrp = getpid();
   if (fcntl(fd, F_SETOWN, pgrp) == -1) {
	perror("fnctl");
	exit(1);
   }
or
       ioctl(fd, SIOCSPGRP, &pgrp)	/* note: & */

I think this should work even if pipes aren't implemented as a pair of
sockets, but I haven't tried any of it.

See select(2). (Just a detail: select will tell you that there is data
to read if there actually is data to read or if the other end(s) have
closed the pipe. In the latter case read() will return an EOF - this
stuff caused me some trouble before I read the *real* documentation -
the OS source code!!)

Good idea,I love making up lists!

Agree,but how about these:

Muffin Man (Frank Zappa)              (I think FZ was the most underrated)
Son of Mr. Green Genes (Frank Zappa)  (guitarist there ever has been.But,)
Son of Orange County (Frank Zappa)    (he can't play anymore,too bad.    )
Push Comes To Show (Van Halen) Eddie Van Halen
Crossroads (Cream) Eric Clapton (The 2nd solo,of course)
Astronomy (Blue \yster Cult) Donald Roeser (on "Some Enchanted Evening")
Lazy (Deep Purple) Ritchie Blackmore
Fat Time (Miles Davis) Mike Stern

I know that when I get home I will kill myself for not adding more solos,
but these are the ones I can think of without looking at my records.
But maybe that's a good sign indicating that these are really my favourites.

I'd be very glad to see some reactions on the list.

Hello. I've been wondering how to get a little extra memory for my
Macintosh Plus (needed in these days of Hypercard and Multifinder).

I was wondering if the normal brute-force method could be used;
  Just solder 1M memory chips on top of the existing one (piggyback)
  and attach CS (chip-select) and whatever else is needed from the
  adressbus to select the appropiate chip. I haven't really checked
  out the memorychips but maybe an inverter is needed for some signals.

  If I'm correctly informed there are 22 bit defining the adress on
  a MC68000, making it possible to have 4M of memory.

*If* this is possibly, would programs take advantage of it?

Well, maybe this is one of the most stupid questions asked to USENET
since it all began and if so - please forgive my ignorance...

You are not trying to say that the US are German-mythological qua
religion, are you? :-)

No, but seriously: what does that tree have to do with Christianity?
(Or, what does the mean US Christmas have to do with it at all - but
that's another story)
Is Santa Claus Christian? The Easter Bunny and its eggs?

While I agree that the dates of these festivities originally come from
the church, the things which are generally celebrated have no origin in
Christian doctrine, and no one pretends so.

Sorry if I offended anyone by this - I am not commenting on those who do
use those times for prayer and as memorial days.

Yes.  I'm using uw4.1 on an SE with System 4.1/Finder 6.0 and a beta version 
of MF (1.0b6).  (As an aside, we can't get System Tools 5.0 in the UK until 
early next year, unless you know different to me !)

UW runs but I do character losses at 9600 baud.  I can't work out why, and
I'm not convinced its UW's fault.  I wrote to John Bruner, the author, who
says other people were reporting the same problem.

Richard, The bug is not in the slightest bit fundamental and could be fixed
in less than 1 day once and for all.  I have done it for a ANSI unix-like I/O
library:
Merely separate the _cnt field
of struct FILE into a _icnt and an _ocnt, change getc/putc to use _icnt/_ocnt.
Fix _filbuf/_flsbuf to use the right one, and to whinge when _icnt/_ocnt
goes -ve when you expect the other one to.
This for free also enables the library to police the "fflush/fseek between
change of direction for I/O" restriction and avoids chaos there.

   Is there anybody out there who has info about whether the Chinese
government has changed the policy regarding students aboard and how
it is changed, because from this April, all students sent by the
government are asked to sign contracts between him/her and his/her
institution.

   What do these contracts mean ?  Does this imply that those who came
out before this April (thus did not sign) then have a somewhat different
status (for example, can not be asked to go back to carry out a certain
contract) ?

   E-mail to me and I'll summurize OR post to the newsgroup.  I believe
there are other people who are also interested in this issue.

I have come across "The Great Explosion", but I also have this part of it
in a collection whose name I have forgotten, under the title "And then there
were none.". Great story. THE BEST AUTHOR EVER.

The eye can see colours (for example, in afterimages) that cannot be

There was an article in Scientific American c.1970 entitled "Phosphenes"
