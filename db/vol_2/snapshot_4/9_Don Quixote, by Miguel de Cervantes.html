lake there comes a plaintive voice saying: ‘Knight, whosoever thou art who
beholdest this dread lake, if thou wouldst win the prize that lies hidden
beneath these dusky waves, prove the valour of thy stout heart and cast
thyself into the midst of its dark burning waters, else thou shalt not be
worthy to see the mighty wonders contained in the seven castles of the
seven Fays that lie beneath this black expanse;’ and then the knight,
almost ere the awful voice has ceased, without stopping to consider,
without pausing to reflect upon the danger to which he is exposing
himself, without even relieving himself of the weight of his massive
armour, commending himself to God and to his lady, plunges into the midst
of the boiling lake, and when he little looks for it, or knows what his
fate is to be, he finds himself among flowery meadows, with which the
Elysian fields are not to be compared.

“The sky seems more transparent there, and the sun shines with a strange
brilliancy, and a delightful grove of green leafy trees presents itself to
the eyes and charms the sight with its verdure, while the ear is soothed
by the sweet untutored melody of the countless birds of gay plumage that
flit to and fro among the interlacing branches. Here he sees a brook whose
limpid waters, like liquid crystal, ripple over fine sands and white
pebbles that look like sifted gold and purest pearls. There he perceives a
cunningly wrought fountain of many-coloured jasper and polished marble;
here another of rustic fashion where the little mussel-shells and the
spiral white and yellow mansions of the snail disposed in studious
disorder, mingled with fragments of glittering crystal and mock emeralds,
make up a work of varied aspect, where art, imitating nature, seems to
have outdone it.

“Suddenly there is presented to his sight a strong castle or gorgeous
palace with walls of massy gold, turrets of diamond and gates of jacinth;
in short, so marvellous is its structure that though the materials of
which it is built are nothing less than diamonds, carbuncles, rubies,
pearls, gold, and emeralds, the workmanship is still more rare. And after
having seen all this, what can be more charming than to see how a bevy of
damsels comes forth from the gate of the castle in gay and gorgeous
attire, such that, were I to set myself now to depict it as the histories
describe it to us, I should never have done; and then how she who seems to
be the first among them all takes the bold knight who plunged into the
boiling lake by the hand, and without addressing a word to him leads him
into the rich palace or castle, and strips him as naked as when his mother
bore him, and bathes him in lukewarm water, and anoints him all over with
sweet-smelling unguents, and clothes him in a shirt of the softest sendal,
all scented and perfumed, while another damsel comes and throws over his
shoulders a mantle which is said to be worth at the very least a city, and
even more? How charming it is, then, when they tell us how, after all
this, they lead him to another chamber where he finds the tables set out
in such style that he is filled with amazement and wonder; to see how they
pour out water for his hands distilled from amber and sweet-scented
flowers; how they seat him on an ivory chair; to see how the damsels wait
on him all in profound silence; how they bring him such a variety of
dainties so temptingly prepared that the appetite is at a loss which to
select; to hear the music that resounds while he is at table, by whom or
whence produced he knows not. And then when the repast is over and the
tables removed, for the knight to recline in the chair, picking his teeth
perhaps as usual, and a damsel, much lovelier than any of the others, to
enter unexpectedly by the chamber door, and herself by his side, and begin
to tell him what the castle is, and how she is held enchanted there, and
other things that amaze the knight and astonish the readers who are
perusing his history.

“But I will not expatiate any further upon this, as it may be gathered
from it that whatever part of whatever history of a knight-errant one
reads, it will fill the reader, whoever he be, with delight and wonder;
and take my advice, sir, and, as I said before, read these books and you
will see how they will banish any melancholy you may feel and raise your
spirits should they be depressed. For myself I can say that since I have
been a knight-errant I have become valiant, polite, generous, well-bred,
magnanimous, courteous, dauntless, gentle, patient, and have learned to
bear hardships, imprisonments, and enchantments; and though it be such a
short time since I have seen myself shut up in a cage like a madman, I
hope by the might of my arm, if heaven aid me and fortune thwart me not,
to see myself king of some kingdom where I may be able to show the
gratitude and generosity that dwell in my heart; for by my faith, señor,
the poor man is incapacitated from showing the virtue of generosity to
anyone, though he may possess it in the highest degree; and gratitude that
consists of disposition only is a dead thing, just as faith without works
is dead. For this reason I should be glad were fortune soon to offer me
some opportunity of making myself an emperor, so as to show my heart in
doing good to my friends, particularly to this poor Sancho Panza, my
squire, who is the best fellow in the world; and I would gladly give him a
county I have promised him this ever so long, only that I am afraid he has
not the capacity to govern his realm.”
</p>
<p>
Sancho partly heard these last words of his master, and said to him,
“Strive hard you, Señor Don Quixote, to give me that county so often
promised by you and so long looked for by me, for I promise you there will
be no want of capacity in me to govern it; and even if there is, I have
heard say there are men in the world who farm seigniories, paying so much
a year, and they themselves taking charge of the government, while the
lord, with his legs stretched out, enjoys the revenue they pay him,
without troubling himself about anything else. That’s what I’ll do, and
not stand haggling over trifles, but wash my hands at once of the whole
business, and enjoy my rents like a duke, and let things go their own
way.”
</p>
<p>
“That, brother Sancho,” said the canon, “only holds good as far as the
enjoyment of the revenue goes; but the lord of the seigniory must attend
to the administration of justice, and here capacity and sound judgment
come in, and above all a firm determination to find out the truth; for if
this be wanting in the beginning, the middle and the end will always go
wrong; and God as commonly aids the honest intentions of the simple as he
frustrates the evil designs of the crafty.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t understand those philosophies,” returned Sancho Panza; “all I
know is I would I had the county as soon as I shall know how to govern it;
for I have as much soul as another, and as much body as anyone, and I
shall be as much king of my realm as any other of his; and being so I
should do as I liked, and doing as I liked I should please myself, and
pleasing myself I should be content, and when one is content he has
nothing more to desire, and when one has nothing more to desire there is
an end of it; so let the county come, and God be with you, and let us see
one another, as one blind man said to the other.”
</p>
<p>
“That is not bad philosophy thou art talking, Sancho,” said the canon;
“but for all that there is a good deal to be said on this matter of
counties.”
</p>
<p>
To which Don Quixote returned, “I know not what more there is to be said;
I only guide myself by the example set me by the great Amadis of Gaul,
when he made his squire count of the Insula Firme; and so, without any
scruples of conscience, I can make a count of Sancho Panza, for he is one
of the best squires that ever knight-errant had.”
</p>
<p>
The canon was astonished at the methodical nonsense (if nonsense be
capable of method) that Don Quixote uttered, at the way in which he had
described the adventure of the knight of the lake, at the impression that
the deliberate lies of the books he read had made upon him, and lastly he
marvelled at the simplicity of Sancho, who desired so eagerly to obtain
the county his master had promised him.
</p>
<p>
By this time the canon’s servants, who had gone to the inn to fetch the
sumpter mule, had returned, and making a carpet and the green grass of the
meadow serve as a table, they seated themselves in the shade of some trees
and made their repast there, that the carter might not be deprived of the
advantage of the spot, as has been already said. As they were eating they
suddenly heard a loud noise and the sound of a bell that seemed to come
from among some brambles and thick bushes that were close by, and the same
instant they observed a beautiful goat, spotted all over black, white, and
brown, spring out of the thicket with a goatherd after it, calling to it
and uttering the usual cries to make it stop or turn back to the fold. The
fugitive goat, scared and frightened, ran towards the company as if
seeking their protection and then stood still, and the goatherd coming up
seized it by the horns and began to talk to it as if it were possessed of
reason and understanding: “Ah wanderer, wanderer, Spotty, Spotty; how have
you gone limping all this time? What wolves have frightened you, my
daughter? Won’t you tell me what is the matter, my beauty? But what else
can it be except that you are a she, and cannot keep quiet? A plague on
your humours and the humours of those you take after! Come back, come
back, my darling; and if you will not be so happy, at any rate you will be
safe in the fold or with your companions; for if you who ought to keep and
lead them, go wandering astray, what will become of them?”
</p>
<p>
The goatherd’s talk amused all who heard it, but especially the canon, who
said to him, “As you live, brother, take it easy, and be not in such a
hurry to drive this goat back to the fold; for, being a female, as you
say, she will follow her natural instinct in spite of all you can do to
prevent it. Take this morsel and drink a sup, and that will soothe your
irritation, and in the meantime the goat will rest herself,” and so
saying, he handed him the loins of a cold rabbit on a fork.
</p>
<p>
The goatherd took it with thanks, and drank and calmed himself, and then
said, “I should be sorry if your worships were to take me for a simpleton
for having spoken so seriously as I did to this animal; but the truth is
there is a certain mystery in the words I used. I am a clown, but not so
much of one but that I know how to behave to men and to beasts.”
</p>
<p>
“That I can well believe,” said the curate, “for I know already by
experience that the woods breed men of learning, and shepherds’ huts harbour
philosophers.”
</p>
<p>
“At all events, señor,” returned the goatherd, “they shelter men of
experience; and that you may see the truth of this and grasp it, though I
may seem to put myself forward without being asked, I will, if it will not
tire you, gentlemen, and you will give me your attention for a little,
tell you a true story which will confirm this gentleman’s word (and he
pointed to the curate) as well as my own.”
</p>
<p>
To this Don Quixote replied, “Seeing that this affair has a certain colour
of chivalry about it, I for my part, brother, will hear you most gladly,
and so will all these gentlemen, from the high intelligence they possess
and their love of curious novelties that interest, charm, and entertain
the mind, as I feel quite sure your story will do. So begin, friend, for
we are all prepared to listen.”
</p>
<p>
“I draw my stakes,” said Sancho, “and will retreat with this pasty to the
brook there, where I mean to victual myself for three days; for I have
heard my lord, Don Quixote, say that a knight-errant’s squire should eat
until he can hold no more, whenever he has the chance, because it often
happens them to get by accident into a wood so thick that they cannot find
a way out of it for six days; and if the man is not well filled or his
alforjas well stored, there he may stay, as very often he does, turned
into a dried mummy.”
</p>
<p>
“Thou art in the right of it, Sancho,” said Don Quixote; “go where thou
wilt and eat all thou canst, for I have had enough, and only want to give
my mind its refreshment, as I shall by listening to this good fellow’s
story.”
</p>
<p>
“It is what we shall all do,” said the canon; and then begged the goatherd
to begin the promised tale.
</p>
<p>
The goatherd gave the goat which he held by the horns a couple of slaps on
the back, saying, “Lie down here beside me, Spotty, for we have time
enough to return to our fold.” The goat seemed to understand him, for as
her master seated himself, she stretched herself quietly beside him and
looked up in his face to show him she was all attention to what he was
going to say, and then in these words he began his story.

Three leagues from this valley there is a village which, though small, is
one of the richest in all this neighbourhood, and in it there lived a
farmer, a very worthy man, and so much respected that, although to be so
is the natural consequence of being rich, he was even more respected for
his virtue than for the wealth he had acquired. But what made him still
more fortunate, as he said himself, was having a daughter of such
exceeding beauty, rare intelligence, gracefulness, and virtue, that
everyone who knew her and beheld her marvelled at the extraordinary gifts
with which heaven and nature had endowed her. As a child she was
beautiful, she continued to grow in beauty, and at the age of sixteen she
was most lovely. The fame of her beauty began to spread abroad through all
the villages around—but why do I say the villages around, merely,
when it spread to distant cities, and even made its way into the halls of
royalty and reached the ears of people of every class, who came from all
sides to see her as if to see something rare and curious, or some
wonder-working image?
</p>
<p>
Her father watched over her and she watched over herself; for there are no
locks, or guards, or bolts that can protect a young girl better than her
own modesty. The wealth of the father and the beauty of the daughter led
many neighbours as well as strangers to seek her for a wife; but he, as
one might well be who had the disposal of so rich a jewel, was perplexed
and unable to make up his mind to which of her countless suitors he should
entrust her. I was one among the many who felt a desire so natural, and,
as her father knew who I was, and I was of the same town, of pure blood,
in the bloom of life, and very rich in possessions, I had great hopes of
success. There was another of the same place and qualifications who also
sought her, and this made her father’s choice hang in the balance, for he
felt that on either of us his daughter would be well bestowed; so to
escape from this state of perplexity he resolved to refer the matter to
Leandra (for that is the name of the rich damsel who has reduced me to
misery), reflecting that as we were both equal it would be best to leave
it to his dear daughter to choose according to her inclination—a
course that is worthy of imitation by all fathers who wish to settle their
children in life. I do not mean that they ought to leave them to make a
choice of what is contemptible and bad, but that they should place before
them what is good and then allow them to make a good choice as they
please. I do not know which Leandra chose; I only know her father put us
both off with the tender age of his daughter and vague words that neither
bound him nor dismissed us. My rival is called Anselmo and I myself
Eugenio—that you may know the names of the personages that figure in
this tragedy, the end of which is still in suspense, though it is plain to
see it must be disastrous.
</p>
<p>
About this time there arrived in our town one Vicente de la Roca, the son
of a poor peasant of the same town, the said Vicente having returned from
service as a soldier in Italy and divers other parts. A captain who
chanced to pass that way with his company had carried him off from our
village when he was a boy of about twelve years, and now twelve years
later the young man came back in a soldier’s uniform, arrayed in a
thousand colours, and all over glass trinkets and fine steel chains.
To-day he would appear in one gay dress, to-morrow in another; but all
flimsy and gaudy, of little substance and less worth. The peasant folk,
who are naturally malicious, and when they have nothing to do can be
malice itself, remarked all this, and took note of his finery and
jewellery, piece by piece, and discovered that he had three suits of
different colours, with garters and stockings to match; but he made so
many arrangements and combinations out of them, that if they had not
counted them, anyone would have sworn that he had made a display of more
than ten suits of clothes and twenty plumes. Do not look upon all this
that I am telling you about the clothes as uncalled for or spun out, for
they have a great deal to do with the story. He used to seat himself on a
bench under the great poplar in our plaza, and there he would keep us all
hanging open-mouthed on the stories he told us of his exploits. There was
no country on the face of the globe he had not seen, nor battle he had not
been engaged in; he had killed more Moors than there are in Morocco and
Tunis, and fought more single combats, according to his own account, than
Garcilaso, Diego García de Paredes and a thousand others he named, and out
of all he had come victorious without losing a drop of blood. On the other
hand he showed marks of wounds, which, though they could not be made out,
he said were gunshot wounds received in divers encounters and actions.
Lastly, with monstrous impudence he used to say “you” to his equals and
even those who knew what he was, and declare that his arm was his father
and his deeds his pedigree, and that being a soldier he was as good as the
king himself. And to add to these swaggering ways he was a trifle of a
musician, and played the guitar with such a flourish that some said he
made it speak; nor did his accomplishments end here, for he was something
of a poet too, and on every trifle that happened in the town he made a
ballad a league long.

This soldier, then, that I have described, this Vicente de la Roca, this
bravo, gallant, musician, poet, was often seen and watched by Leandra from
a window of her house which looked out on the plaza. The glitter of his
showy attire took her fancy, his ballads bewitched her (for he gave away
twenty copies of every one he made), the tales of his exploits which he
told about himself came to her ears; and in short, as the devil no doubt
had arranged it, she fell in love with him before the presumption of
making love to her had suggested itself to him; and as in love-affairs
none are more easily brought to an issue than those which have the
inclination of the lady for an ally, Leandra and Vicente came to an
understanding without any difficulty; and before any of her numerous
suitors had any suspicion of her design, she had already carried it into
effect, having left the house of her dearly beloved father (for mother she
had none), and disappeared from the village with the soldier, who came
more triumphantly out of this enterprise than out of any of the large
number he laid claim to. All the village and all who heard of it were
amazed at the affair; I was aghast, Anselmo thunderstruck, her father full
of grief, her relations indignant, the authorities all in a ferment, the
officers of the Brotherhood in arms. They scoured the roads, they searched
the woods and all quarters, and at the end of three days they found the
flighty Leandra in a mountain cave, stript to her shift, and robbed of all
the money and precious jewels she had carried away from home with her.
</p>
<p>
<br><br><br><br> <a id="c51c"></a>

<div class="fig" style="width:60%;">

<br><br><br>
</p>
<p>
They brought her back to her unhappy father, and questioned her as to her
misfortune, and she confessed without pressure that Vicente de la Roca had
deceived her, and under promise of marrying her had induced her to leave
her father’s house, as he meant to take her to the richest and most
delightful city in the whole world, which was Naples; and that she,
ill-advised and deluded, had believed him, and robbed her father, and
handed over all to him the night she disappeared; and that he had carried
her away to a rugged mountain and shut her up in the cave where they had
found her. She said, moreover, that the soldier, without robbing her of
her honour, had taken from her everything she had, and made off, leaving
her in the cave, a thing that still further surprised everybody. It was
not easy for us to credit the young man’s continence, but she asserted it
with such earnestness that it helped to console her distressed father, who
thought nothing of what had been taken since the jewel that once lost can
never be recovered had been left to his daughter. The same day that
Leandra made her appearance her father removed her from our sight and took
her away to shut her up in a convent in a town near this, in the hope that
time may wear away some of the disgrace she has incurred. Leandra’s youth
furnished an excuse for her fault, at least with those to whom it was of
no consequence whether she was good or bad; but those who knew her
shrewdness and intelligence did not attribute her misdemeanour to
ignorance but to wantonness and the natural disposition of women, which is
for the most part flighty and ill-regulated.
</p>
<p>
Leandra withdrawn from sight, Anselmo’s eyes grew blind, or at any rate
found nothing to look at that gave them any pleasure, and mine were in
darkness without a ray of light to direct them to anything enjoyable while
Leandra was away. Our melancholy grew greater, our patience grew less; we
cursed the soldier’s finery and railed at the carelessness of Leandra’s
father. At last Anselmo and I agreed to leave the village and come to this
valley; and, he feeding a great flock of sheep of his own, and I a large
herd of goats of mine, we pass our life among the trees, giving vent to
our sorrows, together singing the fair Leandra’s praises, or upbraiding
her, or else sighing alone, and to heaven pouring forth our complaints in
solitude. Following our example, many more of Leandra’s lovers have come
to these rude mountains and adopted our mode of life, and they are so
numerous that one would fancy the place had been turned into the pastoral
Arcadia, so full is it of shepherds and sheep-folds; nor is there a spot
in it where the name of the fair Leandra is not heard. Here one curses her
and calls her capricious, fickle, and immodest, there another condemns her
as frail and frivolous; this pardons and absolves her, that spurns and
reviles her; one extols her beauty, another assails her character, and in
short all abuse her, and all adore her, and to such a pitch has this
general infatuation gone that there are some who complain of her scorn
without ever having exchanged a word with her, and even some that bewail
and mourn the raging fever of jealousy, for which she never gave anyone
cause, for, as I have already said, her misconduct was known before her
passion. There is no nook among the rocks, no brookside, no shade beneath
the trees that is not haunted by some shepherd telling his woes to the
breezes; wherever there is an echo it repeats the name of Leandra; the
mountains ring with “Leandra,” “Leandra” murmur the brooks, and Leandra
keeps us all bewildered and bewitched, hoping without hope and fearing
without knowing what we fear. Of all this silly set the one that shows the
least and also the most sense is my rival Anselmo, for having so many
other things to complain of, he only complains of separation, and to the
accompaniment of a rebeck, which he plays admirably, he sings his
complaints in verses that show his ingenuity. I follow another, easier,
and to my mind wiser course, and that is to rail at the frivolity of
women, at their inconstancy, their double dealing, their broken promises,
their unkept pledges, and in short the want of reflection they show in
fixing their affections and inclinations. This, sirs, was the reason of
words and expressions I made use of to this goat when I came up just now;
for as she is a female I have a contempt for her, though she is the best
in all my fold. This is the story I promised to tell you, and if I have
been tedious in telling it, I will not be slow to serve you; my hut is
close by, and I have fresh milk and dainty cheese there, as well as a
variety of toothsome fruit, no less pleasing to the eye than to the
palate.

The goatherd’s tale gave great satisfaction to all the hearers, and the
canon especially enjoyed it, for he had remarked with particular attention
the manner in which it had been told, which was as unlike the manner of a
clownish goatherd as it was like that of a polished city wit; and he
observed that the curate had been quite right in saying that the woods
bred men of learning. They all offered their services to Eugenio but he
who showed himself most liberal in this way was Don Quixote, who said to
him, “Most assuredly, brother goatherd, if I found myself in a position to
attempt any adventure, I would, this very instant, set out on your behalf,
and would rescue Leandra from that convent (where no doubt she is kept
against her will), in spite of the abbess and all who might try to prevent
me, and would place her in your hands to deal with her according to your
will and pleasure, observing, however, the laws of chivalry which lay down
that no violence of any kind is to be offered to any damsel. But I trust
in God our Lord that the might of one malignant enchanter may not prove so
great but that the power of another better disposed may prove superior to
it, and then I promise you my support and assistance, as I am bound to do
by my profession, which is none other than to give aid to the weak and
needy.”
</p>
<p>
The goatherd eyed him, and noticing Don Quixote’s sorry appearance and
looks, he was filled with wonder, and asked the barber, who was next him,
“Señor, who is this man who makes such a figure and talks in such a
strain?”
</p>
<p>
“Who should it be,” said the barber, “but the famous Don Quixote of La
Mancha, the undoer of injustice, the righter of wrongs, the protector of
damsels, the terror of giants, and the winner of battles?”
</p>
<p>
“That,” said the goatherd, “sounds like what one reads in the books of the
knights-errant, who did all that you say this man does; though it is my
belief that either you are joking, or else this gentleman has empty
lodgings in his head.”
</p>
<p>
“You are a great scoundrel,” said Don Quixote, “and it is you who are
empty and a fool. I am fuller than ever was the whoreson bitch that bore
you;” and passing from words to deeds, he caught up a loaf that was near
him and sent it full in the goatherd’s face, with such force that he
flattened his nose; but the goatherd, who did not understand jokes, and
found himself roughly handled in such good earnest, paying no respect to
carpet, tablecloth, or diners, sprang upon Don Quixote, and seizing him by
the throat with both hands would no doubt have throttled him, had not
Sancho Panza that instant come to the rescue, and grasping him by the
shoulders flung him down on the table, smashing plates, breaking glasses,
and upsetting and scattering everything on it. Don Quixote, finding
himself free, strove to get on top of the goatherd, who, with his face
covered with blood, and soundly kicked by Sancho, was on all fours feeling
about for one of the table-knives to take a bloody revenge with. The canon
and the curate, however, prevented him, but the barber so contrived it
that he got Don Quixote under him, and rained down upon him such a shower
of fisticuffs that the poor knight’s face streamed with blood as freely as
his own. The canon and the curate were bursting with laughter, the
officers were capering with delight, and both the one and the other hissed
them on as they do dogs that are worrying one another in a fight. Sancho
alone was frantic, for he could not free himself from the grasp of one of
the canon’s servants, who kept him from going to his master’s assistance.

At last, while they were all, with the exception of the two bruisers who
were mauling each other, in high glee and enjoyment, they heard a trumpet
sound a note so doleful that it made them all look in the direction whence
the sound seemed to come. But the one that was most excited by hearing it
was Don Quixote, who though sorely against his will he was under the
goatherd, and something more than pretty well pummelled, said to him,
“Brother devil (for it is impossible but that thou must be one since thou
hast had might and strength enough to overcome mine), I ask thee to agree
to a truce for but one hour for the solemn note of yonder trumpet that
falls on our ears seems to me to summon me to some new adventure.” The
goatherd, who was by this time tired of pummelling and being pummelled,
released him at once, and Don Quixote rising to his feet and turning his
eyes to the quarter where the sound had been heard, suddenly saw coming
down the slope of a hill several men clad in white like penitents.
</p>
<p>
The fact was that the clouds had that year withheld their moisture from
the earth, and in all the villages of the district they were organising
processions, rogations, and penances, imploring God to open the hands of
his mercy and send the rain; and to this end the people of a village that
was hard by were going in procession to a holy hermitage there was on one
side of that valley. Don Quixote when he saw the strange garb of the
penitents, without reflecting how often he had seen it before, took it
into his head that this was a case of adventure, and that it fell to him
alone as a knight-errant to engage in it; and he was all the more
confirmed in this notion, by the idea that an image draped in black they
had with them was some illustrious lady that these villains and
discourteous thieves were carrying off by force. As soon as this occurred
to him he ran with all speed to Rocinante who was grazing at large, and
taking the bridle and the buckler from the saddle-bow, he had him bridled
in an instant, and calling to Sancho for his sword he mounted Rocinante,
braced his buckler on his arm, and in a loud voice exclaimed to those who
stood by, “Now, noble company, ye shall see how important it is that there
should be knights in the world professing the order of knight-errantry; now, I
say, ye shall see, by the deliverance of that worthy lady who is borne
captive there, whether knights-errant deserve to be held in estimation,”
and so saying he brought his legs to bear on Rocinante—for he had no
spurs—and at a full canter (for in all this veracious history we
never read of Rocinante fairly galloping) set off to encounter the
penitents, though the curate, the canon, and the barber ran to prevent
him. But it was out of their power, nor did he even stop for the shouts of
Sancho calling after him, “Where are you going, Señor Don Quixote? What
devils have possessed you to set you on against our Catholic faith? Plague
take me! mind, that is a procession of penitents, and the lady they are
carrying on that stand there is the blessed image of the immaculate
Virgin. Take care what you are doing, señor, for this time it may be
safely said you don’t know what you are about.” Sancho laboured in vain,
for his master was so bent on coming to quarters with these sheeted
figures and releasing the lady in black that he did not hear a word; and
even had he heard, he would not have turned back if the king had ordered
him. He came up with the procession and reined in Rocinante, who was
already anxious enough to slacken speed a little, and in a hoarse, excited
voice he exclaimed, “You who hide your faces, perhaps because you are not
good subjects, pay attention and listen to what I am about to say to you.”
The first to halt were those who were carrying the image, and one of the
four ecclesiastics who were chanting the Litany, struck by the strange
figure of Don Quixote, the leanness of Rocinante, and the other ludicrous
peculiarities he observed, said in reply to him, “Brother, if you have
anything to say to us say it quickly, for these brethren are whipping
themselves, and we cannot stop, nor is it reasonable we should stop to
hear anything, unless indeed it is short enough to be said in two words.”
</p>
<p>
“I will say it in one,” replied Don Quixote, “and it is this; that at
once, this very instant, ye release that fair lady whose tears and sad
aspect show plainly that ye are carrying her off against her will, and
that ye have committed some scandalous outrage against her; and I, who was
born into the world to redress all such like wrongs, will not permit you
to advance another step until you have restored to her the liberty she
pines for and deserves.”
</p>
<p>
From these words all the hearers concluded that he must be a madman, and
began to laugh heartily, and their laughter acted like gunpowder on Don
Quixote’s fury, for drawing his sword without another word he made a rush
at the stand. One of those who supported it, leaving the burden to his
comrades, advanced to meet him, flourishing a forked stick that he had for
propping up the stand when resting, and with this he caught a mighty cut
Don Quixote made at him that severed it in two; but with the portion that
remained in his hand he dealt such a thwack on the shoulder of Don
Quixote’s sword arm (which the buckler could not protect against the
clownish assault) that poor Don Quixote came to the ground in a sad
plight.
</p>
<p>
Sancho Panza, who was coming on close behind puffing and blowing, seeing
him fall, cried out to his assailant not to strike him again, for he was a
poor enchanted knight, who had never harmed anyone all the days of his
life; but what checked the clown was, not Sancho’s shouting, but seeing
that Don Quixote did not stir hand or foot; and so, fancying he had killed
him, he hastily hitched up his tunic under his girdle and took to his
heels across the country like a deer.
</p>
<p>
By this time all Don Quixote’s companions had come up to where he lay; but
the processionists seeing them come running, and with them the officers of
the Brotherhood with their crossbows, apprehended mischief, and clustering
round the image, raised their hoods, and grasped their scourges, as the
priests did their tapers, and awaited the attack, resolved to defend
themselves and even to take the offensive against their assailants if they
could. Fortune, however, arranged the matter better than they expected,
for all Sancho did was to fling himself on his master’s body, raising over
him the most doleful and laughable lamentation that ever was heard, for he
believed he was dead. The curate was known to another curate who walked in
the procession, and their recognition of one another set at rest the
apprehensions of both parties; the first then told the other in two words
who Don Quixote was, and he and the whole troop of penitents went to see
if the poor gentleman was dead, and heard Sancho Panza saying, with tears
in his eyes, “Oh flower of chivalry, that with one blow of a stick hast
ended the course of thy well-spent life! Oh pride of thy race, honour and
glory of all La Mancha, nay, of all the world, that for want of thee will
be full of evil-doers, no longer in fear of punishment for their misdeeds!
Oh thou, generous above all the Alexanders, since for only eight months of
service thou hast given me the best island the sea girds or surrounds!
Humble with the proud, haughty with the humble, encounterer of dangers,
endurer of outrages, enamoured without reason, imitator of the good,
scourge of the wicked, enemy of the mean, in short, knight-errant, which
is all that can be said!”
</p>

<br><br><br>
</p>
<p>
At the cries and moans of Sancho, Don Quixote came to himself, and the
first word he said was, “He who lives separated from you, sweetest
Dulcinea, has greater miseries to endure than these. Aid me, friend
Sancho, to mount the enchanted cart, for I am not in a condition to press
the saddle of Rocinante, as this shoulder is all knocked to pieces.”
</p>
<p>
“That I will do with all my heart, señor,” said Sancho; “and let us return
to our village with these gentlemen, who seek your good, and there we will
prepare for making another sally, which may turn out more profitable and
creditable to us.”
</p>
<p>
“Thou art right, Sancho,” returned Don Quixote; “It will be wise to let
the malign influence of the stars which now prevails pass off.”
</p>
<p>
The canon, the curate, and the barber told him he would act very wisely in
doing as he said; and so, highly amused at Sancho Panza’s simplicities,
they placed Don Quixote in the cart as before. The procession once more
formed itself in order and proceeded on its road; the goatherd took his
leave of the party; the officers of the Brotherhood declined to go any
farther, and the curate paid them what was due to them; the canon begged
the curate to let him know how Don Quixote did, whether he was cured of
his madness or still suffered from it, and then begged leave to continue
his journey; in short, they all separated and went their ways, leaving to
themselves the curate and the barber, Don Quixote, Sancho Panza, and the
good Rocinante, who regarded everything with as great resignation as his
master. The carter yoked his oxen and made Don Quixote comfortable on a
truss of hay, and at his usual deliberate pace took the road the curate
directed, and at the end of six days they reached Don Quixote’s village,
and entered it about the middle of the day, which it so happened was a
Sunday, and the people were all in the plaza, through which Don Quixote’s
cart passed. They all flocked to see what was in the cart, and when they
recognised their townsman they were filled with amazement, and a boy ran
off to bring the news to his housekeeper and his niece that their master
and uncle had come back all lean and yellow and stretched on a truss of
hay on an ox-cart. It was piteous to hear the cries the two good ladies
raised, how they beat their breasts and poured out fresh maledictions on
those accursed books of chivalry; all which was renewed when they saw Don
Quixote coming in at the gate.
</p>
<p>
At the news of Don Quixote’s arrival Sancho Panza’s wife came running, for
she by this time knew that her husband had gone away with him as his
squire, and on seeing Sancho, the first thing she asked him was if the ass
was well. Sancho replied that he was, better than his master was.
</p>
<p>
“Thanks be to God,” said she, “for being so good to me; but now tell me,
my friend, what have you made by your squirings? What gown have you
brought me back? What shoes for your children?”
</p>
<p>
“I bring nothing of that sort, wife,” said Sancho; “though I bring other
things of more consequence and value.”
</p>
<p>
“I am very glad of that,” returned his wife; “show me these things of more
value and consequence, my friend; for I want to see them to cheer my heart
that has been so sad and heavy all these ages that you have been away.”
</p>
<p>
“I will show them to you at home, wife,” said Sancho; “be content for the
present; for if it please God that we should again go on our travels in
search of adventures, you will soon see me a count, or governor of an
island, and that not one of those everyday ones, but the best that is to
be had.”
</p>
<p>
“Heaven grant it, husband,” said she, “for indeed we have need of it. But
tell me, what’s this about islands, for I don’t understand it?”
</p>
<p>
“Honey is not for the mouth of the ass,” returned Sancho; “all in good
time thou shalt see, wife—nay, thou wilt be surprised to hear
thyself called ‘your ladyship’ by all thy vassals.”
</p>
<p>
“What are you talking about, Sancho, with your ladyships, islands, and
vassals?” returned Teresa Panza—for so Sancho’s wife was called,
though they were not relations, for in La Mancha it is customary for wives
to take their husbands’ surnames.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t be in such a hurry to know all this, Teresa,” said Sancho; “it is
enough that I am telling you the truth, so shut your mouth. But I may tell
you this much by the way, that there is nothing in the world more
delightful than to be a person of consideration, squire to a
knight-errant, and a seeker of adventures. To be sure most of those one
finds do not end as pleasantly as one could wish, for out of a hundred,
ninety-nine will turn out cross and contrary. I know it by experience, for
out of some I came blanketed, and out of others belaboured. Still, for all
that, it is a fine thing to be on the look-out for what may happen,
crossing mountains, searching woods, climbing rocks, visiting castles,
putting up at inns, all at free quarters, and devil take the maravedi to
pay.”
</p>
<p>
While this conversation passed between Sancho Panza and his wife, Don
Quixote’s housekeeper and niece took him in and undressed him and laid him
in his old bed. He eyed them askance, and could not make out where he was.
The curate charged his niece to be very careful to make her uncle
comfortable and to keep a watch over him lest he should make his escape
from them again, telling her what they had been obliged to do to bring him
home. On this the pair once more lifted up their voices and renewed their
maledictions upon the books of chivalry, and implored heaven to plunge the
authors of such lies and nonsense into the midst of the bottomless pit.
They were, in short, kept in anxiety and dread lest their uncle and master
should give them the slip the moment he found himself somewhat better, and
as they feared so it fell out.
</p>
<p>
But the author of this history, though he has devoted research and
industry to the discovery of the deeds achieved by Don Quixote in his
third sally, has been unable to obtain any information respecting them, at
any rate derived from authentic documents; tradition has merely preserved
in the memory of La Mancha the fact that Don Quixote, the third time he
sallied forth from his home, betook himself to Saragossa, where he was
present at some famous jousts which came off in that city, and that he had
adventures there worthy of his valour and high intelligence. Of his end
and death he could learn no particulars, nor would he have ascertained it
or known of it, if good fortune had not produced an old physician for him
who had in his possession a leaden box, which, according to his account,
had been discovered among the crumbling foundations of an ancient
hermitage that was being rebuilt; in which box were found certain
parchment manuscripts in Gothic character, but in Castilian verse,
containing many of his achievements, and setting forth the beauty of
Dulcinea, the form of Rocinante, the fidelity of Sancho Panza, and the
burial of Don Quixote himself, together with sundry epitaphs and eulogies
on his life and character; but all that could be read and deciphered were
those which the trustworthy author of this new and unparalleled history
here presents. And the said author asks of those that shall read it
nothing in return for the vast toil which it has cost him in examining and
searching the Manchegan archives in order to bring it to light, save that
they give him the same credit that people of sense give to the books of
chivalry that pervade the world and are so popular; for with this he will
consider himself amply paid and fully satisfied, and will be encouraged to
seek out and produce other histories, if not as truthful, at least equal
in invention and not less entertaining. The first words written on the
parchment found in the leaden box were these:

<h3>DEDICATION OF VOLUME II.</h3>
<p>
<br><br>
</p>
<h3>TO THE COUNT OF LEMOS:</h3>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>
These days past, when sending Your Excellency my plays, that had appeared
in print before being shown on the stage, I said, if I remember well, that
Don Quixote was putting on his spurs to go and render homage to Your
Excellency. Now I say that “with his spurs, he is on his way.”
Should he reach destination methinks I shall have rendered some service to
Your Excellency, as from many parts I am urged to send him off, so as to
dispel the loathing and disgust caused by another Don Quixote who, under
the name of Second Part, has run masquerading through the whole world. And
he who has shown the greatest longing for him has been the great Emperor
of China, who wrote me a letter in Chinese a month ago and sent it by a
special courier. He asked me, or to be truthful, he begged me to send him
Don Quixote, for he intended to found a college where the Spanish tongue
would be taught, and it was his wish that the book to be read should be
the History of Don Quixote. He also added that I should go and be the
rector of this college. I asked the bearer if His Majesty had afforded a
sum in aid of my travel expenses. He answered, “No, not even in
thought.”
</p>
<p>
“Then, brother,” I replied, “you can return to your
China, post haste or at whatever haste you are bound to go, as I am not
fit for so long a travel and, besides being ill, I am very much without
money, while Emperor for Emperor and Monarch for Monarch, I have at Naples
the great Count of Lemos, who, without so many petty titles of colleges
and rectorships, sustains me, protects me and does me more favour than I
can wish for.”
</p>
<p>
Thus I gave him his leave and I beg mine from you, offering Your
Excellency the “Trabajos de Persiles y Sigismunda,” a book I
shall finish within four months, Deo volente, and which will be either the
worst or the best that has been composed in our language, I mean of those
intended for entertainment; at which I repent of having called it the
worst, for, in the opinion of friends, it is bound to attain the summit of
possible quality. May Your Excellency return in such health that is wished

<p>
God bless me, gentle (or it may be plebeian) reader, how eagerly must thou
be looking forward to this preface, expecting to find there retaliation,
scolding, and abuse against the author of the second Don Quixote—I
mean him who was, they say, begotten at Tordesillas and born at Tarragona!
Well then, the truth is, I am not going to give thee that satisfaction;
for, though injuries stir up anger in humbler breasts, in mine the rule
must admit of an exception. Thou wouldst have me call him ass, fool, and
malapert, but I have no such intention; let his offence be his punishment,
with his bread let him eat it, and there’s an end of it. What I
cannot help taking amiss is that he charges me with being old and
one-handed, as if it had been in my power to keep time from passing over
me, or as if the loss of my hand had been brought about in some tavern,
and not on the grandest occasion the past or present has seen, or the
future can hope to see. If my wounds have no beauty to the beholder’s
eye, they are, at least, honourable in the estimation of those who know
where they were received; for the soldier shows to greater advantage dead
in battle than alive in flight; and so strongly is this my feeling, that
if now it were proposed to perform an impossibility for me, I would rather
have had my share in that mighty action, than be free from my wounds this
minute without having been present at it. Those the soldier shows on his
face and breast are stars that direct others to the heaven of honour and
ambition of merited praise; and moreover it is to be observed that it is
not with grey hairs that one writes, but with the understanding, and that
commonly improves with years. I take it amiss, too, that he calls me
envious, and explains to me, as if I were ignorant, what envy is; for
really and truly, of the two kinds there are, I only know that which is
holy, noble, and high-minded; and if that be so, as it is, I am not likely
to attack a priest, above all if, in addition, he holds the rank of
familiar of the Holy Office. And if he said what he did on account of him
on whose behalf it seems he spoke, he is entirely mistaken; for I worship
the genius of that person, and admire his works and his unceasing and
strenuous industry. After all, I am grateful to this gentleman, the
author, for saying that my novels are more satirical than exemplary, but
that they are good; for they could not be that unless there was a little
of everything in them.
</p>
<p>
I suspect thou wilt say that I am taking a very humble line, and keeping
myself too much within the bounds of my moderation, from a feeling that
additional suffering should not be inflicted upon a sufferer, and that
what this gentleman has to endure must doubtless be very great, as he does
not dare to come out into the open field and broad daylight, but hides his
name and disguises his country as if he had been guilty of some lese
majesty. If perchance thou shouldst come to know him, tell him from me
that I do not hold myself aggrieved; for I know well what the temptations
of the devil are, and that one of the greatest is putting it into a man’s
head that he can write and print a book by which he will get as much fame
as money, and as much money as fame; and to prove it I will beg of you, in
your own sprightly, pleasant way, to tell him this story.
</p>
<p>
There was a madman in Seville who took to one of the drollest absurdities
and vagaries that ever madman in the world gave way to. It was this: he
made a tube of reed sharp at one end, and catching a dog in the street, or
wherever it might be, he with his foot held one of its legs fast, and with
his hand lifted up the other, and as best he could fixed the tube where,
by blowing, he made the dog as round as a ball; then holding it in this
position, he gave it a couple of slaps on the belly, and let it go, saying
to the bystanders (and there were always plenty of them): “Do your
worships think, now, that it is an easy thing to blow up a dog?”—Does
your worship think now, that it is an easy thing to write a book?
</p>
<p>
And if this story does not suit him, you may, dear reader, tell him this
one, which is likewise of a madman and a dog.
</p>
<p>
In Cordova there was another madman, whose way it was to carry a piece of
marble slab or a stone, not of the lightest, on his head, and when he came
upon any unwary dog he used to draw close to him and let the weight fall
right on top of him; on which the dog in a rage, barking and howling,
would run three streets without stopping. It so happened, however, that
one of the dogs he discharged his load upon was a cap-maker’s dog,
of which his master was very fond. The stone came down hitting it on the
head, the dog raised a yell at the blow, the master saw the affair and was
wroth, and snatching up a measuring-yard rushed out at the madman and did
not leave a sound bone in his body, and at every stroke he gave him he
said, “You dog, you thief! my lurcher! Don’t you see, you
brute, that my dog is a lurcher?” and so, repeating the word “lurcher”
again and again, he sent the madman away beaten to a jelly. The madman
took the lesson to heart, and vanished, and for more than a month never
once showed himself in public; but after that he came out again with his
old trick and a heavier load than ever. He came up to where there was a
dog, and examining it very carefully without venturing to let the stone
fall, he said: “This is a lurcher; ware!” In short, all the
dogs he came across, be they mastiffs or terriers, he said were lurchers;
and he discharged no more stones. Maybe it will be the same with this
historian; that he will not venture another time to discharge the weight
of his wit in books, which, being bad, are harder than stones. Tell him,
too, that I do not care a farthing for the threat he holds out to me of
depriving me of my profit by means of his book; for, to borrow from the
famous interlude of “The Perendenga,” I say in answer to him,
“Long life to my lord the Veintiquatro, and Christ be with us all.”
Long life to the great Conde de Lemos, whose Christian charity and
well-known generosity support me against all the strokes of my curst
fortune; and long life to the supreme benevolence of His Eminence of
Toledo, Don Bernardo de Sandoval y Rojas; and what matter if there be no
printing-presses in the world, or if they print more books against me than
there are letters in the verses of Mingo Revulgo! These two princes,
unsought by any adulation or flattery of mine, of their own goodness
alone, have taken it upon them to show me kindness and protect me, and in
this I consider myself happier and richer than if Fortune had raised me to
her greatest height in the ordinary way. The poor man may retain honour,
but not the vicious; poverty may cast a cloud over nobility, but cannot
hide it altogether; and as virtue of itself sheds a certain light, even
though it be through the straits and chinks of penury, it wins the esteem
of lofty and noble spirits, and in consequence their protection. Thou
needst say no more to him, nor will I say anything more to thee, save to
tell thee to bear in mind that this Second Part of “Don Quixote”
which I offer thee is cut by the same craftsman and from the same cloth as
the First, and that in it I present thee Don Quixote continued, and at
length dead and buried, so that no one may dare to bring forward any
further evidence against him, for that already produced is sufficient; and
suffice it, too, that some reputable person should have given an account
of all these shrewd lunacies of his without going into the matter again;
for abundance, even of good things, prevents them from being valued; and
scarcity, even in the case of what is bad, confers a certain value. I was
forgetting to tell thee that thou mayest expect the “Persiles,”
which I am now finishing, and also the Second Part of “Galatea.”

</p>
<p>
Cide Hamete Benengeli, in the Second Part of this history, and third sally
of Don Quixote, says that the curate and the barber remained nearly a
month without seeing him, lest they should recall or bring back to his
recollection what had taken place. They did not, however, omit to visit
his niece and housekeeper, and charge them to be careful to treat him with
attention, and give him comforting things to eat, and such as were good
for the heart and the brain, whence, it was plain to see, all his
misfortune proceeded. The niece and housekeeper replied that they did so,
and meant to do so with all possible care and assiduity, for they could
perceive that their master was now and then beginning to show signs of
being in his right mind. This gave great satisfaction to the curate and
the barber, for they concluded they had taken the right course in carrying
him off enchanted on the ox-cart, as has been described in the First Part
of this great as well as accurate history, in the last chapter thereof. So
they resolved to pay him a visit and test the improvement in his
condition, although they thought it almost impossible that there could be
any; and they agreed not to touch upon any point connected with
knight-errantry so as not to run the risk of reopening wounds which were
still so tender.
</p>
<p>
They came to see him consequently, and found him sitting up in bed in a
green baize waistcoat and a red Toledo cap, and so withered and dried up
that he looked as if he had been turned into a mummy. They were very
cordially received by him; they asked him after his health, and he talked
to them about himself very naturally and in very well-chosen language. In
the course of their conversation they fell to discussing what they call
State-craft and systems of government, correcting this abuse and
condemning that, reforming one practice and abolishing another, each of
the three setting up for a new legislator, a modern Lycurgus, or a
brand-new Solon; and so completely did they remodel the State, that they
seemed to have thrust it into a furnace and taken out something quite
different from what they had put in; and on all the subjects they dealt
with, Don Quixote spoke with such good sense that the pair of examiners
were fully convinced that he was quite recovered and in his full senses.
</p>
<p>
The niece and housekeeper were present at the conversation and could not
find words enough to express their thanks to God at seeing their master so
clear in his mind; the curate, however, changing his original plan, which
was to avoid touching upon matters of chivalry, resolved to test Don
Quixote’s recovery thoroughly, and see whether it were genuine or
not; and so, from one subject to another, he came at last to talk of the
news that had come from the capital, and, among other things, he said it
was considered certain that the Turk was coming down with a powerful
fleet, and that no one knew what his purpose was, or when the great storm
would burst; and that all Christendom was in apprehension of this, which
almost every year calls us to arms, and that his Majesty had made
provision for the security of the coasts of Naples and Sicily and the
island of Malta.
</p>
<p>
To this Don Quixote replied, “His Majesty has acted like a prudent
warrior in providing for the safety of his realms in time, so that the
enemy may not find him unprepared; but if my advice were taken I would
recommend him to adopt a measure which at present, no doubt, his Majesty
is very far from thinking of.”
</p>
<p>
The moment the curate heard this he said to himself, “God keep thee
in his hand, poor Don Quixote, for it seems to me thou art precipitating
thyself from the height of thy madness into the profound abyss of thy
simplicity.”
</p>
<p>
But the barber, who had the same suspicion as the curate, asked Don
Quixote what would be his advice as to the measures that he said ought to
be adopted; for perhaps it might prove to be one that would have to be
added to the list of the many impertinent suggestions that people were in
the habit of offering to princes.
</p>
<p>
“Mine, master shaver,” said Don Quixote, “will not be
impertinent, but, on the contrary, pertinent.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t mean that,” said the barber, “but that
experience has shown that all or most of the expedients which are proposed
to his Majesty are either impossible, or absurd, or injurious to the King
and to the kingdom.”
</p>
<p>
“Mine, however,” replied Don Quixote, “is neither
impossible nor absurd, but the easiest, the most reasonable, the readiest
and most expeditious that could suggest itself to any projector’s
mind.”
</p>
<p>
“You take a long time to tell it, Señor Don Quixote,” said the
curate.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t choose to tell it here, now,” said Don Quixote,
“and have it reach the ears of the lords of the council to-morrow
morning, and some other carry off the thanks and rewards of my trouble.”
</p>
<p>
“For my part,” said the barber, “I give my word here and
before God that I will not repeat what your worship says, to King, Rook or
earthly man—an oath I learned from the ballad of the curate, who, in
the prelude, told the king of the thief who had robbed him of the hundred
gold crowns and his pacing mule.”
</p>
<p>
“I am not versed in stories,” said Don Quixote; “but I
know the oath is a good one, because I know the barber to be an honest
fellow.”
</p>
<p>
“Even if he were not,” said the curate, “I will go bail
and answer for him that in this matter he will be as silent as a dummy,
under pain of paying any penalty that may be pronounced.”
</p>
<p>
“And who will be security for you, señor curate?” said Don
Quixote.
</p>
<p>
“My profession,” replied the curate, “which is to keep
secrets.”
</p>
<p>
“Ods body!” said Don Quixote at this, “what more has his
Majesty to do but to command, by public proclamation, all the
knights-errant that are scattered over Spain to assemble on a fixed day in
the capital, for even if no more than half a dozen come, there may be one
among them who alone will suffice to destroy the entire might of the Turk.
Give me your attention and follow me. Is it, pray, any new thing for a
single knight-errant to demolish an army of two hundred thousand men, as
if they all had but one throat or were made of sugar paste? Nay, tell me,
how many histories are there filled with these marvels? If only (in an
evil hour for me: I don’t speak for anyone else) the famous Don
Belianis were alive now, or anyone of the innumerable progeny of Amadis
of Gaul! If any these were alive to-day, and were to come face to face with
the Turk, by my faith, I would not give much for the Turk’s chance.
But God will have regard for his people, and will provide someone, who,
if not so valiant as the knights-errant of yore, at least will not be
inferior to them in spirit; but God knows what I mean, and I say no more.”
</p>
<p>
“Alas!” exclaimed the niece at this, “may I die if my
master does not want to turn knight-errant again;” to which Don
Quixote replied, “A knight-errant I shall die, and let the Turk come
down or go up when he likes, and in as strong force as he can, once more I
say, God knows what I mean.” But here the barber said, “I ask
your worships to give me leave to tell a short story of something that
happened in Seville, which comes so pat to the purpose just now that I
should like greatly to tell it.” Don Quixote gave him leave, and the
rest prepared to listen, and he began thus:
</p>
<p>
“In the madhouse at Seville there was a man whom his relations had
placed there as being out of his mind. He was a graduate of Osuna in canon
law; but even if he had been of Salamanca, it was the opinion of most
people that he would have been mad all the same. This graduate, after some
years of confinement, took it into his head that he was sane and in his
full senses, and under this impression wrote to the Archbishop, entreating
him earnestly, and in very correct language, to have him released from the
misery in which he was living; for by God’s mercy he had now
recovered his lost reason, though his relations, in order to enjoy his
property, kept him there, and, in spite of the truth, would make him out
to be mad until his dying day. The Archbishop, moved by repeated sensible,
well-written letters, directed one of his chaplains to make inquiry of the
madhouse as to the truth of the licentiate’s statements, and to have
an interview with the madman himself, and, if it should appear that he was
in his senses, to take him out and restore him to liberty. The chaplain
did so, and the governor assured him that the man was still mad, and that
though he often spoke like a highly intelligent person, he would in the
end break out into nonsense that in quantity and quality counterbalanced
all the sensible things he had said before, as might be easily tested by
talking to him. The chaplain resolved to try the experiment, and obtaining
access to the madman conversed with him for an hour or more, during the
whole of which time he never uttered a word that was incoherent or absurd,
but, on the contrary, spoke so rationally that the chaplain was compelled
to believe him to be sane. Among other things, he said the governor was
against him, not to lose the presents his relations made him for reporting
him still mad but with lucid intervals; and that the worst foe he had in
his misfortune was his large property; for in order to enjoy it his
enemies disparaged and threw doubts upon the mercy our Lord had shown him
in turning him from a brute beast into a man. In short, he spoke in such a
way that he cast suspicion on the governor, and made his relations appear
covetous and heartless, and himself so rational that the chaplain
determined to take him away with him that the Archbishop might see him,
and ascertain for himself the truth of the matter. Yielding to this
conviction, the worthy chaplain begged the governor to have the clothes in
which the licentiate had entered the house given to him. The governor
again bade him beware of what he was doing, as the licentiate was beyond a
doubt still mad; but all his cautions and warnings were unavailing to
dissuade the chaplain from taking him away. The governor, seeing that it
was the order of the Archbishop, obeyed, and they dressed the licentiate
in his own clothes, which were new and decent. He, as soon as he saw
himself clothed like one in his senses, and divested of the appearance of
a madman, entreated the chaplain to permit him in charity to go and take
leave of his comrades the madmen. The chaplain said he would go with him
to see what madmen there were in the house; so they went upstairs, and
with them some of those who were present. Approaching a cage in which
there was a furious madman, though just at that moment calm and quiet, the
licentiate said to him, ‘Brother, think if you have any commands for
me, for I am going home, as God has been pleased, in his infinite goodness
and mercy, without any merit of mine, to restore me my reason. I am now
cured and in my senses, for with God’s power nothing is impossible.
Have strong hope and trust in him, for as he has restored me to my
original condition, so likewise he will restore you if you trust in him. I
will take care to send you some good things to eat; and be sure you eat
them; for I would have you know I am convinced, as one who has gone
through it, that all this madness of ours comes of having the stomach
empty and the brains full of wind. Take courage! take courage! for
despondency in misfortune breaks down health and brings on death.’
</p>
<p>
“To all these words of the licentiate another madman in a cage
opposite that of the furious one was listening; and raising himself up
from an old mat on which he lay stark naked, he asked in a loud voice who
it was that was going away cured and in his senses. The licentiate
answered, ‘It is I, brother, who am going; I have now no need to
remain here any longer, for which I return infinite thanks to Heaven that
has had so great mercy upon me.’
</p>
<p>
“‘Mind what you are saying, licentiate; don’t let the
devil deceive you,’ replied the madman. ‘Keep quiet, stay
where you are, and you will save yourself the trouble of coming back.’
</p>
<p>
“‘I know I am cured,’ returned the licentiate, ‘and
that I shall not have to go stations again.’
</p>
<p>
“‘You cured!’ said the madman; ‘well, we shall
see; God be with you; but I swear to you by Jupiter, whose majesty I
represent on earth, that for this crime alone, which Seville is committing
to-day in releasing you from this house, and treating you as if you were
in your senses, I shall have to inflict such a punishment on it as will be
remembered for ages and ages, amen. Dost thou not know, thou miserable
little licentiate, that I can do it, being, as I say, Jupiter the
Thunderer, who hold in my hands the fiery bolts with which I am able and
am wont to threaten and lay waste the world? But in one way only will I
punish this ignorant town, and that is by not raining upon it, nor on any
part of its district or territory, for three whole years, to be reckoned
from the day and moment when this threat is pronounced. Thou free, thou
cured, thou in thy senses! and I mad, I disordered, I bound! I will as
soon think of sending rain as of hanging myself.
</p>
<p>
“Those present stood listening to the words and exclamations of the
madman; but our licentiate, turning to the chaplain and seizing him by the
hands, said to him, ‘Be not uneasy, señor; attach no importance to
what this madman has said; for if he is Jupiter and will not send rain, I,
who am Neptune, the father and god of the waters, will rain as often as it
pleases me and may be needful.’
</p>
<p>
“The governor and the bystanders laughed, and at their laughter the
chaplain was half ashamed, and he replied, ‘For all that, Señor
Neptune, it will not do to vex Señor Jupiter; remain where you are, and
some other day, when there is a better opportunity and more time, we will
come back for you.’ So they stripped the licentiate, and he was left
where he was; and that’s the end of the story.”
</p>
<p>
“So that’s the story, master barber,” said Don Quixote,
“which came in so pat to the purpose that you could not help telling
it? Master shaver, master shaver! how blind is he who cannot see through a
sieve. Is it possible that you do not know that comparisons of wit with
wit, valour with valour, beauty with beauty, birth with birth, are always
odious and unwelcome? I, master barber, am not Neptune, the god of the
waters, nor do I try to make anyone take me for an astute man, for I am
not one. My only endeavour is to convince the world of the mistake it
makes in not reviving in itself the happy time when the order of
knight-errantry was in the field. But our depraved age does not deserve to
enjoy such a blessing as those ages enjoyed when knights-errant took upon
their shoulders the defence of kingdoms, the protection of damsels, the
succour of orphans and minors, the chastisement of the proud, and the
recompense of the humble. With the knights of these days, for the most
part, it is the damask, brocade, and rich stuffs they wear, that rustle as
they go, not the chain mail of their armour; no knight now-a-days sleeps
in the open field exposed to the inclemency of heaven, and in full panoply
from head to foot; no one now takes a nap, as they call it, without
drawing his feet out of the stirrups, and leaning upon his lance, as the
knights-errant used to do; no one now, issuing from the wood, penetrates
yonder mountains, and then treads the barren, lonely shore of the sea—mostly
a tempestuous and stormy one—and finding on the beach a little bark
without oars, sail, mast, or tackling of any kind, in the intrepidity of
his heart flings himself into it and commits himself to the wrathful
billows of the deep sea, that one moment lift him up to heaven and the
next plunge him into the depths; and opposing his breast to the
irresistible gale, finds himself, when he least expects it, three thousand
leagues and more away from the place where he embarked; and leaping ashore
in a remote and unknown land has adventures that deserve to be written,
not on parchment, but on brass. But now sloth triumphs over energy,
indolence over exertion, vice over virtue, arrogance over courage, and
theory over practice in arms, which flourished and shone only in the
golden ages and in knights-errant. For tell me, who was more virtuous and
more valiant than the famous Amadis of Gaul? Who more discreet than
Palmerin of England? Who more gracious and easy than Tirante el Blanco?
Who more courtly than Lisuarte of Greece? Who more slashed or slashing
than Don Belianis? Who more intrepid than Perion of Gaul? Who more ready
to face danger than Felixmarte of Hircania? Who more sincere than
Esplandian? Who more impetuous than Don Cirongilio of Thrace? Who more
bold than Rodamonte? Who more prudent than King Sobrino? Who more daring
than Reinaldos? Who more invincible than Roland? and who more gallant and
courteous than Ruggiero, from whom the dukes of Ferrara of the present day
are descended, according to Turpin in his ‘Cosmography.’ All
these knights, and many more that I could name, señor curate, were
knights-errant, the light and glory of chivalry. These, or such as these,
I would have to carry out my plan, and in that case his Majesty would find
himself well served and would save great expense, and the Turk would be
left tearing his beard. And so I will stay where I am, as the chaplain
does not take me away; and if Jupiter, as the barber has told us, will not
send rain, here am I, and I will rain when I please. I say this that
Master Basin may know that I understand him.”
</p>
<p>
“Indeed, Señor Don Quixote,” said the barber, “I did not
mean it in that way, and, so help me God, my intention was good, and your
worship ought not to be vexed.”
</p>
<p>
“As to whether I ought to be vexed or not,” returned Don
Quixote, “I myself am the best judge.”
</p>
<p>
Hereupon the curate observed, “I have hardly said a word as yet; and
I would gladly be relieved of a doubt, arising from what Don Quixote has
said, that worries and works my conscience.”
</p>
<p>
“The señor curate has leave for more than that,” returned Don
Quixote, “so he may declare his doubt, for it is not pleasant to
have a doubt on one’s conscience.”
</p>
<p>
“Well then, with that permission,” said the curate, “I
say my doubt is that, all I can do, I cannot persuade myself that the
whole pack of knights-errant you, Señor Don Quixote, have mentioned, were
really and truly persons of flesh and blood, that ever lived in the world;
on the contrary, I suspect it to be all fiction, fable, and falsehood, and
dreams told by men awakened from sleep, or rather still half asleep.”
</p>
<p>
“That is another mistake,” replied Don Quixote, “into
which many have fallen who do not believe that there ever were such
knights in the world, and I have often, with divers people and on divers
occasions, tried to expose this almost universal error to the light of
truth. Sometimes I have not been successful in my purpose, sometimes I
have, supporting it upon the shoulders of the truth; which truth is so
clear that I can almost say I have with my own eyes seen Amadis of Gaul,
who was a man of lofty stature, fair complexion, with a handsome though
black beard, of a countenance between gentle and stern in expression,
sparing of words, slow to anger, and quick to put it away from him; and as
I have depicted Amadis, so I could, I think, portray and describe all the
knights-errant that are in all the histories in the world; for by the
perception I have that they were what their histories describe, and by the
deeds they did and the dispositions they displayed, it is possible, with
the aid of sound philosophy, to deduce their features, complexion, and
stature.”
</p>
<p>
“How big, in your worship’s opinion, may the giant Morgante
have been, Señor Don Quixote?” asked the barber.
</p>
<p>
“With regard to giants,” replied Don Quixote, “opinions
differ as to whether there ever were any or not in the world; but the Holy
Scripture, which cannot err by a jot from the truth, shows us that there
were, when it gives us the history of that big Philistine, Goliath, who
was seven cubits and a half in height, which is a huge size. Likewise, in
the island of Sicily, there have been found leg-bones and arm-bones so
large that their size makes it plain that their owners were giants, and as
tall as great towers; geometry puts this fact beyond a doubt. But, for all
that, I cannot speak with certainty as to the size of Morgante, though I
suspect he cannot have been very tall; and I am inclined to be of this
opinion because I find in the history in which his deeds are particularly
mentioned, that he frequently slept under a roof and as he found houses to
contain him, it is clear that his bulk could not have been anything
excessive.”
</p>
<p>
“That is true,” said the curate, and yielding to the enjoyment
of hearing such nonsense, he asked him what was his notion of the features
of Reinaldos of Montalban, and Don Roland and the rest of the Twelve Peers
of France, for they were all knights-errant.
</p>
<p>
“As for Reinaldos,” replied Don Quixote, “I venture to
say that he was broad-faced, of ruddy complexion, with roguish and
somewhat prominent eyes, excessively punctilious and touchy, and given to
the society of thieves and scapegraces. With regard to Roland, or
Rotolando, or Orlando (for the histories call him by all these names), I
am of opinion, and hold, that he was of middle height, broad-shouldered,
rather bow-legged, swarthy-complexioned, red-bearded, with a hairy body
and a severe expression of countenance, a man of few words, but very
polite and well-bred.”
</p>
<p>
“If Roland was not a more graceful person than your worship has
described,” said the curate, “it is no wonder that the fair
Lady Angelica rejected him and left him for the gaiety, liveliness, and
grace of that budding-bearded little Moor to whom she surrendered herself;
and she showed her sense in falling in love with the gentle softness of
Medoro rather than the roughness of Roland.”
</p>
<p>
“That Angelica, señor curate,” returned Don Quixote, “was
a giddy damsel, flighty and somewhat wanton, and she left the world as
full of her vagaries as of the fame of her beauty. She treated with scorn
a thousand gentlemen, men of valour and wisdom, and took up with a
smooth-faced sprig of a page, without fortune or fame, except such
reputation for gratitude as the affection he bore his friend got for him.
The great poet who sang her beauty, the famous Ariosto, not caring to sing
her adventures after her contemptible surrender (which probably were not
over and above creditable), dropped her where he says:
</p>
<p class="poem">
How she received the sceptre of Cathay,<br>
Some bard of defter quill may sing some day;
</p>
<p class="noindent">
and this was no doubt a kind of prophecy, for poets are also called
<i>vates</i>, that is to say diviners; and its truth was made plain; for since
then a famous Andalusian poet has lamented and sung her tears, and another
famous and rare poet, a Castilian, has sung her beauty.”
</p>
<p>
“Tell me, Señor Don Quixote,” said the barber here, “among
all those who praised her, has there been no poet to write a satire on
this Lady Angelica?”
</p>
<p>
“I can well believe,” replied Don Quixote, “that if
Sacripante or Roland had been poets they would have given the damsel a
trimming; for it is naturally the way with poets who have been scorned and
rejected by their ladies, whether fictitious or not, in short by those
whom they select as the ladies of their thoughts, to avenge themselves in
satires and libels—a vengeance, to be sure, unworthy of generous
hearts; but up to the present I have not heard of any defamatory verse
against the Lady Angelica, who turned the world upside down.”
</p>
<p>
“Strange,” said the curate; but at this moment they heard the
housekeeper and the niece, who had previously withdrawn from the
conversation, exclaiming aloud in the courtyard, and at the noise they all
ran out.

</p>
<p>
The history relates that the outcry Don Quixote, the curate, and the
barber heard came from the niece and the housekeeper exclaiming to Sancho,
who was striving to force his way in to see Don Quixote while they held
the door against him, “What does the vagabond want in this house? Be
off to your own, brother, for it is you, and no one else, that delude my
master, and lead him astray, and take him tramping about the country.”
</p>
<p>
To which Sancho replied, “Devil’s own housekeeper! it is I who
am deluded, and led astray, and taken tramping about the country, and not
thy master! He has carried me all over the world, and you are mightily
mistaken. He enticed me away from home by a trick, promising me an island,
which I am still waiting for.”
</p>
<p>
“May evil islands choke thee, thou detestable Sancho,” said
the niece; “What are islands? Is it something to eat, glutton and
gormandiser that thou art?”
</p>
<p>
“It is not something to eat,” replied Sancho, “but
something to govern and rule, and better than four cities or four
judgeships at court.”
</p>
<p>
“For all that,” said the housekeeper, “you don’t
enter here, you bag of mischief and sack of knavery; go govern your house
and dig your seed-patch, and give over looking for islands or shylands.”
</p>
<p>
The curate and the barber listened with great amusement to the words of
the three; but Don Quixote, uneasy lest Sancho should blab and blurt out a
whole heap of mischievous stupidities, and touch upon points that might
not be altogether to his credit, called to him and made the other two hold
their tongues and let him come in. Sancho entered, and the curate and the
barber took their leave of Don Quixote, of whose recovery they despaired
when they saw how wedded he was to his crazy ideas, and how saturated with
the nonsense of his unlucky chivalry; and said the curate to the barber,
“You will see, gossip, that when we are least thinking of it, our
gentleman will be off once more for another flight.”
</p>
<p>
“I have no doubt of it,” returned the barber; “but I do
not wonder so much at the madness of the knight as at the simplicity of
the squire, who has such a firm belief in all that about the island, that
I suppose all the exposures that could be imagined would not get it out of
his head.”
</p>
<p>
“God help them,” said the curate; “and let us be on the
look-out to see what comes of all these absurdities of the knight and
squire, for it seems as if they had both been cast in the same mould, and
the madness of the master without the simplicity of the man would not be
worth a farthing.”
</p>
<p>
“That is true,” said the barber, “and I should like very
much to know what the pair are talking about at this moment.”
</p>
<p>
“I promise you,” said the curate, “the niece or the
housekeeper will tell us by-and-by, for they are not the ones to forget to
listen.”
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile Don Quixote shut himself up in his room with Sancho, and when
they were alone he said to him, “It grieves me greatly, Sancho, that
thou shouldst have said, and sayest, that I took thee out of thy cottage,
when thou knowest I did not remain in my house. We sallied forth together,
we took the road together, we wandered abroad together; we have had the
same fortune and the same luck; if they blanketed thee once, they
belaboured me a hundred times, and that is the only advantage I have of
thee.”
</p>
<p>
“That was only reasonable,” replied Sancho, “for, by
what your worship says, misfortunes belong more properly to knights-errant
than to their squires.”
</p>
<p>
“Thou art mistaken, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “according
to the maxim <i>quando caput dolet</i>, etc.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t understand any language but my own,” said
Sancho.
</p>
<p>
“I mean to say,” said Don Quixote, “that when the head
suffers all the members suffer; and so, being thy lord and master, I am
thy head, and thou a part of me as thou art my servant; and therefore any
evil that affects or shall affect me should give thee pain, and what
affects thee give pain to me.”
</p>
<p>
“It should be so,” said Sancho; “but when I was
blanketed as a member, my head was on the other side of the wall, looking
on while I was flying through the air, and did not feel any pain whatever;
and if the members are obliged to feel the suffering of the head, it
should be obliged to feel their sufferings.”
</p>
<p>
“Dost thou mean to say now, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “that
I did not feel when they were blanketing thee? If thou dost, thou must not
say so or think so, for I felt more pain then in spirit than thou didst in
body. But let us put that aside for the present, for we shall have
opportunities enough for considering and settling the point; tell me,
Sancho my friend, what do they say about me in the village here? What do
the common people think of me? What do the hidalgos? What do the
caballeros? What do they say of my valour; of my achievements; of my
courtesy? How do they treat the task I have undertaken in reviving and
restoring to the world the now forgotten order of chivalry? In short,
Sancho, I would have thee tell me all that has come to thine ears on this
subject; and thou art to tell me, without adding anything to the good or
taking away anything from the bad; for it is the duty of loyal vassals to
tell the truth to their lords just as it is and in its proper shape, not
allowing flattery to add to it or any idle deference to lessen it. And I
would have thee know, Sancho, that if the naked truth, undisguised by
flattery, came to the ears of princes, times would be different, and other
ages would be reckoned iron ages more than ours, which I hold to be the
golden of these latter days. Profit by this advice, Sancho, and report to
me clearly and faithfully the truth of what thou knowest touching what I
have demanded of thee.”
</p>
<p>
“That I will do with all my heart, master,” replied Sancho,
“provided your worship will not be vexed at what I say, as you wish
me to say it out in all its nakedness, without putting any more clothes on
it than it came to my knowledge in.”
</p>
<p>
“I will not be vexed at all,” returned Don Quixote; “thou
mayest speak freely, Sancho, and without any beating about the bush.”
</p>
<p>
“Well then,” said he, “first of all, I have to tell you
that the common people consider your worship a mighty great madman, and me
no less a fool. The hidalgos say that, not keeping within the bounds of
your quality of gentleman, you have assumed the ‘Don,’ and
made a knight of yourself at a jump, with four vine-stocks and a couple of
acres of land, and never a shirt to your back. The caballeros say they do
not want to have hidalgos setting up in opposition to them, particularly
squire hidalgos who polish their own shoes and darn their black stockings
with green silk.”
</p>
<p>
“That,” said Don Quixote, “does not apply to me, for I
always go well dressed and never patched; ragged I may be, but ragged more
from the wear and tear of arms than of time.”
</p>
<p>
“As to your worship’s valour, courtesy, accomplishments, and
task, there is a variety of opinions. Some say, ‘mad but droll;’
others, ‘valiant but unlucky;’ others, ‘courteous but
meddling,’ and then they go into such a number of things that they
don’t leave a whole bone either in your worship or in myself.”
</p>
<p>
“Recollect, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “that wherever
virtue exists in an eminent degree it is persecuted. Few or none of the
famous men that have lived escaped being calumniated by malice. Julius
Cæsar, the boldest, wisest, and bravest of captains, was charged with
being ambitious, and not particularly cleanly in his dress, or pure in his
morals. Of Alexander, whose deeds won him the name of Great, they say that
he was somewhat of a drunkard. Of Hercules, him of the many labours, it is
said that he was lewd and luxurious. Of Don Galaor, the brother of Amadis
of Gaul, it was whispered that he was over-quarrelsome, and of his brother
that he was lachrymose. So that, O Sancho, amongst all these calumnies
against good men, mine may be let pass, since they are no more than thou
hast said.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s just where it is, body of my father!”
</p>
<p>
“Is there more, then?” asked Don Quixote.
</p>
<p>
“There’s the tail to be skinned yet,” said Sancho;
“all so far is cakes and fancy bread; but if your worship wants to
know all about the calumnies they bring against you, I will fetch you one
this instant who can tell you the whole of them without missing an atom;
for last night the son of Bartholomew Carrasco, who has been studying at
Salamanca, came home after having been made a bachelor, and when I went to
welcome him, he told me that your worship’s history is already
abroad in books, with the title of THE INGENIOUS GENTLEMAN DON QUIXOTE OF
LA MANCHA; and he says they mention me in it by my own name of Sancho
Panza, and the lady Dulcinea del Toboso too, and divers things that
happened to us when we were alone; so that I crossed myself in my wonder
how the historian who wrote them down could have known them.”
</p>
<p>
“I promise thee, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “the author
of our history will be some sage enchanter; for to such nothing that they
choose to write about is hidden.”
</p>
<p>
“What!” said Sancho, “a sage and an enchanter! Why, the
bachelor Samson Carrasco (that is the name of him I spoke of) says the
author of the history is called Cide Hamete Berengena.”
</p>
<p>
“That is a Moorish name,” said Don Quixote.
</p>
<p>
“May be so,” replied Sancho; “for I have heard say that
the Moors are mostly great lovers of berengenas.”
</p>
<p>
“Thou must have mistaken the surname of this ‘Cide’—which
means in Arabic ‘Lord’—Sancho,” observed Don
Quixote.
</p>
<p>
“Very likely,” replied Sancho, “but if your worship
wishes me to fetch the bachelor I will go for him in a twinkling.”
</p>
<p>
“Thou wilt do me a great pleasure, my friend,” said Don
Quixote, “for what thou hast told me has amazed me, and I shall not
eat a morsel that will agree with me until I have heard all about it.”
</p>
<p>
“Then I am off for him,” said Sancho; and leaving his master
he went in quest of the bachelor, with whom he returned in a short time,
and, all three together, they had a very droll colloquy.

<p>
Don Quixote remained very deep in thought, waiting for the bachelor
Carrasco, from whom he was to hear how he himself had been put into a book
as Sancho said; and he could not persuade himself that any such history
could be in existence, for the blood of the enemies he had slain was not
yet dry on the blade of his sword, and now they wanted to make out that
his mighty achievements were going about in print. For all that, he
fancied some sage, either a friend or an enemy, might, by the aid of
magic, have given them to the press; if a friend, in order to magnify and
exalt them above the most famous ever achieved by any knight-errant; if an
enemy, to bring them to naught and degrade them below the meanest ever
recorded of any low squire, though as he said to himself, the achievements
of squires never were recorded. If, however, it were the fact that such a
history were in existence, it must necessarily, being the story of a
knight-errant, be grandiloquent, lofty, imposing, grand and true. With
this he comforted himself somewhat, though it made him uncomfortable to
think that the author was a Moor, judging by the title of “Cide;”
and that no truth was to be looked for from Moors, as they are all
impostors, cheats, and schemers. He was afraid he might have dealt with
his love affairs in some indecorous fashion, that might tend to the
discredit and prejudice of the purity of his lady Dulcinea del Toboso; he
would have had him set forth the fidelity and respect he had always
observed towards her, spurning queens, empresses, and damsels of all
sorts, and keeping in check the impetuosity of his natural impulses.
Absorbed and wrapped up in these and divers other cogitations, he was
found by Sancho and Carrasco, whom Don Quixote received with great
courtesy.
</p>
<p>
The bachelor, though he was called Samson, was of no great bodily size,
but he was a very great wag; he was of a sallow complexion, but very
sharp-witted, somewhere about four-and-twenty years of age, with a round
face, a flat nose, and a large mouth, all indications of a mischievous
disposition and a love of fun and jokes; and of this he gave a sample as
soon as he saw Don Quixote, by falling on his knees before him and saying,
“Let me kiss your mightiness’s hand, Señor Don Quixote of La
Mancha, for, by the habit of St. Peter that I wear, though I have no more
than the first four orders, your worship is one of the most famous
knights-errant that have ever been, or will be, all the world over. A
blessing on Cide Hamete Benengeli, who has written the history of your
great deeds, and a double blessing on that connoisseur who took the
trouble of having it translated out of the Arabic into our Castilian
vulgar tongue for the universal entertainment of the people!”
</p>
<p>
Don Quixote made him rise, and said, “So, then, it is true that
there is a history of me, and that it was a Moor and a sage who wrote it?”
</p>
<p>
“So true is it, señor,” said Samson, “that my belief is
there are more than twelve thousand volumes of the said history in print
this very day. Only ask Portugal, Barcelona, and Valencia, where they have
been printed, and moreover there is a report that it is being printed at
Antwerp, and I am persuaded there will not be a country or language in
which there will not be a translation of it.”
</p>
<p>
“One of the things,” here observed Don Quixote, “that
ought to give most pleasure to a virtuous and eminent man is to find
himself in his lifetime in print and in type, familiar in people’s
mouths with a good name; I say with a good name, for if it be the
opposite, then there is no death to be compared to it.”
</p>
<p>
“If it goes by good name and fame,” said the bachelor, “your
worship alone bears away the palm from all the knights-errant; for the
Moor in his own language, and the Christian in his, have taken care to set
before us your gallantry, your high courage in encountering dangers, your
fortitude in adversity, your patience under misfortunes as well as wounds,
the purity and continence of the platonic loves of your worship and my
lady Doña Dulcinea del Toboso—”
</p>
<p>
“I never heard my lady Dulcinea called Doña,” observed Sancho
here; “nothing more than the lady Dulcinea del Toboso; so here
already the history is wrong.”
</p>
<p>
“That is not an objection of any importance,” replied
Carrasco.
</p>
<p>
“Certainly not,” said Don Quixote; “but tell me, señor
bachelor, what deeds of mine are they that are made most of in this
history?”
</p>
<p>
“On that point,” replied the bachelor, “opinions differ,
as tastes do; some swear by the adventure of the windmills that your
worship took to be Briareuses and giants; others by that of the fulling
mills; one cries up the description of the two armies that afterwards took
the appearance of two droves of sheep; another that of the dead body on
its way to be buried at Segovia; a third says the liberation of the galley
slaves is the best of all, and a fourth that nothing comes up to the
affair with the Benedictine giants, and the battle with the valiant
Biscayan.”
</p>
<p>
“Tell me, señor bachelor,” said Sancho at this point, “does
the adventure with the Yanguesans come in, when our good Rocinante went
hankering after dainties?”
</p>
<p>
“The sage has left nothing in the ink-bottle,” replied Samson;
“he tells all and sets down everything, even to the capers that
worthy Sancho cut in the blanket.”
</p>
<p>
“I cut no capers in the blanket,” returned Sancho; “in
the air I did, and more of them than I liked.”
</p>
<p>
“There is no human history in the world, I suppose,” said Don
Quixote, “that has not its ups and downs, but more than others such
as deal with chivalry, for they can never be entirely made up of
prosperous adventures.”
</p>
<p>
“For all that,” replied the bachelor, “there are those
who have read the history who say they would have been glad if the author
had left out some of the countless cudgellings that were inflicted on
Señor Don Quixote in various encounters.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s where the truth of the history comes in,” said
Sancho.
</p>
<p>
“At the same time they might fairly have passed them over in
silence,” observed Don Quixote; “for there is no need of
recording events which do not change or affect the truth of a history, if
they tend to bring the hero of it into contempt. Æneas was not in truth
and earnest so pious as Virgil represents him, nor Ulysses so wise as
Homer describes him.”
</p>
<p>
“That is true,” said Samson; “but it is one thing to
write as a poet, another to write as a historian; the poet may describe or
sing things, not as they were, but as they ought to have been; but the
historian has to write them down, not as they ought to have been, but as
they were, without adding anything to the truth or taking anything from
it.”
</p>
<p>
“Well then,” said Sancho, “if this señor Moor goes in
for telling the truth, no doubt among my master’s drubbings mine are
to be found; for they never took the measure of his worship’s
shoulders without doing the same for my whole body; but I have no right to
wonder at that, for, as my master himself says, the members must share the
pain of the head.”
</p>
<p>
“You are a sly dog, Sancho,” said Don Quixote; “i’
faith, you have no want of memory when you choose to remember.”
</p>
<p>
“If I were to try to forget the thwacks they gave me,” said
Sancho, “my weals would not let me, for they are still fresh on my
ribs.”
</p>
<p>
“Hush, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “and don’t
interrupt the bachelor, whom I entreat to go on and tell all that is said
about me in this history.”
</p>
<p>
“And about me,” said Sancho, “for they say, too, that I
am one of the principal presonages in it.”
</p>
<p>
“Personages, not presonages, friend Sancho,” said Samson.
</p>
<p>
“What! Another word-catcher!” said Sancho; “if that’s
to be the way we shall not make an end in a lifetime.”
</p>
<p>
“May God shorten mine, Sancho,” returned the bachelor, “if
you are not the second person in the history, and there are even some who
would rather hear you talk than the cleverest in the whole book; though
there are some, too, who say you showed yourself over-credulous in
believing there was any possibility in the government of that island
offered you by Señor Don Quixote.”
</p>
<p>
“There is still sunshine on the wall,” said Don Quixote;
“and when Sancho is somewhat more advanced in life, with the
experience that years bring, he will be fitter and better qualified for
being a governor than he is at present.”
</p>
<p>
“By God, master,” said Sancho, “the island that I cannot
govern with the years I have, I’ll not be able to govern with the
years of Methuselah; the difficulty is that the said island keeps its
distance somewhere, I know not where; and not that there is any want of
head in me to govern it.”
</p>
<p>
“Leave it to God, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “for all
will be and perhaps better than you think; no leaf on the tree stirs but
by God’s will.”
</p>
<p>
“That is true,” said Samson; “and if it be God’s
will, there will not be any want of a thousand islands, much less one, for
Sancho to govern.”
</p>
<p>
“I have seen governors in these parts,” said Sancho, “that
are not to be compared to my shoe-sole; and for all that they are called
‘your lordship’ and served on silver.”
</p>
<p>
“Those are not governors of islands,” observed Samson, “but
of other governments of an easier kind: those that govern islands must at
least know grammar.”
</p>
<p>
“I could manage the gram well enough,” said Sancho; “but
for the mar I have neither leaning nor liking, for I don’t know what
it is; but leaving this matter of the government in God’s hands, to
send me wherever it may be most to his service, I may tell you, señor
bachelor Samson Carrasco, it has pleased me beyond measure that the author
of this history should have spoken of me in such a way that what is said
of me gives no offence; for, on the faith of a true squire, if he had said
anything about me that was at all unbecoming an old Christian, such as I
am, the deaf would have heard of it.”
</p>
<p>
“That would be working miracles,” said Samson.
</p>
<p>
“Miracles or no miracles,” said Sancho, “let everyone
mind how he speaks or writes about people, and not set down at random the
first thing that comes into his head.”
</p>
<p>
“One of the faults they find with this history,” said the
bachelor, “is that its author inserted in it a novel called ‘The
Ill-advised Curiosity;’ not that it is bad or ill-told, but that it
is out of place and has nothing to do with the history of his worship
Señor Don Quixote.”
</p>
<p>
“I will bet the son of a dog has mixed the cabbages and the baskets,”
said Sancho.
</p>
<p>
“Then, I say,” said Don Quixote, “the author of my history
was no sage, but some ignorant chatterer, who, in a haphazard and heedless way,
set about writing it, let it turn out as it might, just as Orbaneja, the
painter of Úbeda, used to do, who, when they asked him what he was painting,
answered, ‘What it may turn out.’ Sometimes he would paint a cock
in such a fashion, and so unlike, that he had to write alongside of it in
Gothic letters, ‘This is a cock;’ and so it will be with my
history, which will require a commentary to make it intelligible.”
</p>
<p>
“No fear of that,” returned Samson, “for it is so plain
that there is nothing in it to puzzle over; the children turn its leaves,
the young people read it, the grown men understand it, the old folk praise
it; in a word, it is so thumbed, and read, and got by heart by people of
all sorts, that the instant they see any lean hack, they say, ‘There
goes Rocinante.’ And those that are most given to reading it are the
pages, for there is not a lord’s ante-chamber where there is not a
‘Don Quixote’ to be found; one takes it up if another lays it
down; this one pounces upon it, and that begs for it. In short, the said
history is the most delightful and least injurious entertainment that has
been hitherto seen, for there is not to be found in the whole of it even
the semblance of an immodest word, or a thought that is other than
Catholic.”
</p>
<p>
“To write in any other way,” said Don Quixote, “would not be
to write truth, but falsehood, and historians who have recourse to falsehood
ought to be burned, like those who coin false money; and I know not what could
have led the author to have recourse to novels and irrelevant stories, when he
had so much to write about in mine; no doubt he must have gone by the proverb
‘with straw or with hay, &amp;c.,’ for by merely setting forth my
thoughts, my sighs, my tears, my lofty purposes, my enterprises, he might have
made a volume as large, or larger than all the works of El Tostado would make
up. In fact, the conclusion I arrive at, señor bachelor, is, that to write
histories, or books of any kind, there is need of great judgment and a ripe
understanding. To give expression to humour, and write in a strain of graceful
pleasantry, is the gift of great geniuses. The cleverest character in comedy is
the clown, for he who would make people take him for a fool, must not be one.
History is in a measure a sacred thing, for it should be true, and where the
truth is, there God is; but notwithstanding this, there are some who write and
fling books broadcast on the world as if they were fritters.”
</p>
<p>
“There is no book so bad but it has something good in it,”
said the bachelor.
</p>
<p>
“No doubt of that,” replied Don Quixote; “but it often
happens that those who have acquired and attained a well-deserved
reputation by their writings, lose it entirely, or damage it in some
degree, when they give them to the press.”
</p>
<p>
“The reason of that,” said Samson, “is, that as printed
works are examined leisurely, their faults are easily seen; and the
greater the fame of the writer, the more closely are they scrutinised. Men
famous for their genius, great poets, illustrious historians, are always,
or most commonly, envied by those who take a particular delight and
pleasure in criticising the writings of others, without having produced
any of their own.”
</p>
<p>
“That is no wonder,” said Don Quixote; “for there are
many divines who are no good for the pulpit, but excellent in detecting
the defects or excesses of those who preach.”
</p>
<p>
“All that is true, Señor Don Quixote,” said Carrasco; “but I
wish such fault-finders were more lenient and less exacting, and did not pay so
much attention to the spots on the bright sun of the work they grumble at; for
if <i>aliquando bonus dormitat Homerus</i>, they should remember how long he
remained awake to shed the light of his work with as little shade as possible;
and perhaps it may be that what they find fault with may be moles, that
sometimes heighten the beauty of the face that bears them; and so I say very
great is the risk to which he who prints a book exposes himself, for of all
impossibilities the greatest is to write one that will satisfy and please all
readers.”
</p>
<p>
“That which treats of me must have pleased few,” said Don
Quixote.
</p>
<p>
“Quite the contrary,” said the bachelor; “for, as
<i>stultorum infinitum est numerus</i>, innumerable are those who have relished
the said history; but some have brought a charge against the author’s
memory, inasmuch as he forgot to say who the thief was who stole Sancho’s
Dapple; for it is not stated there, but only to be inferred from what is set
down, that he was stolen, and a little farther on we see Sancho mounted on the
same ass, without any reappearance of it. They say, too, that he forgot to
state what Sancho did with those hundred crowns that he found in the valise in
the Sierra Morena, as he never alludes to them again, and there are many who
would be glad to know what he did with them, or what he spent them on, for it
is one of the serious omissions of the work.”
</p>
<p>
“Señor Samson, I am not in a humour now for going into accounts or
explanations,” said Sancho; “for there’s a sinking of
the stomach come over me, and unless I doctor it with a couple of sups of
the old stuff it will put me on the thorn of Santa Lucia. I have it at
home, and my old woman is waiting for me; after dinner I’ll come
back, and will answer you and all the world every question you may choose
to ask, as well about the loss of the ass as about the spending of the
hundred crowns;” and without another word or waiting for a reply he
made off home.
</p>
<p>
Don Quixote begged and entreated the bachelor to stay and do penance with
him. The bachelor accepted the invitation and remained, a couple of young
pigeons were added to the ordinary fare, at dinner they talked chivalry,
Carrasco fell in with his host’s humour, the banquet came to an end,
they took their afternoon sleep, Sancho returned, and their conversation
was resumed.

Sancho came back to Don Quixote’s house, and returning to the late
subject of conversation, he said, “As to what Señor Samson said,
that he would like to know by whom, or how, or when my ass was stolen, I
say in reply that the same night we went into the Sierra Morena, flying
from the Holy Brotherhood after that unlucky adventure of the galley
slaves, and the other of the corpse that was going to Segovia, my master
and I ensconced ourselves in a thicket, and there, my master leaning on
his lance, and I seated on my Dapple, battered and weary with the late
frays we fell asleep as if it had been on four feather mattresses; and I
in particular slept so sound, that, whoever he was, he was able to come
and prop me up on four stakes, which he put under the four corners of the
pack-saddle in such a way that he left me mounted on it, and took away
Dapple from under me without my feeling it.”
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
“That is an easy matter,” said Don Quixote, “and it is
no new occurrence, for the same thing happened to Sacripante at the siege
of Albracca; the famous thief, Brunello, by the same contrivance, took his
horse from between his legs.”
</p>
<p>
“Day came,” continued Sancho, “and the moment I stirred
the stakes gave way and I fell to the ground with a mighty come down; I
looked about for the ass, but could not see him; the tears rushed to my
eyes and I raised such a lamentation that, if the author of our history
has not put it in, he may depend upon it he has left out a good thing.
Some days after, I know not how many, travelling with her ladyship the
Princess Micomicona, I saw my ass, and mounted upon him, in the dress of a
gipsy, was that Gines de Pasamonte, the great rogue and rascal that my
master and I freed from the chain.”
</p>
<p>
“That is not where the mistake is,” replied Samson; “it
is, that before the ass has turned up, the author speaks of Sancho as
being mounted on it.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know what to say to that,” said Sancho, “unless
that the historian made a mistake, or perhaps it might be a blunder of the
printer’s.”
</p>
<p>
“No doubt that’s it,” said Samson; “but what
became of the hundred crowns? Did they vanish?”
</p>
<p>
To which Sancho answered, “I spent them for my own good, and my wife’s,
and my children’s, and it is they that have made my wife bear so
patiently all my wanderings on highways and byways, in the service of my
master, Don Quixote; for if after all this time I had come back to the
house without a rap and without the ass, it would have been a poor
look-out for me; and if anyone wants to know anything more about me, here
I am, ready to answer the king himself in person; and it is no affair of
anyone’s whether I took or did not take, whether I spent or did not
spend; for the whacks that were given me in these journeys were to be paid
for in money, even if they were valued at no more than four maravedis
apiece, another hundred crowns would not pay me for half of them. Let each
look to himself and not try to make out white black, and black white; for
each of us is as God made him, aye, and often worse.”
</p>
<p>
“I will take care,” said Carrasco, “to impress upon the
author of the history that, if he prints it again, he must not forget what
worthy Sancho has said, for it will raise it a good span higher.”
</p>
<p>
“Is there anything else to correct in the history, señor bachelor?”
asked Don Quixote.
</p>
<p>
“No doubt there is,” replied he; “but not anything that
will be of the same importance as those I have mentioned.”
</p>
<p>
“Does the author promise a second part at all?” said Don
Quixote.
</p>
<p>
“He does promise one,” replied Samson; “but he says he
has not found it, nor does he know who has got it; and we cannot say
whether it will appear or not; and so, on that head, as some say that no
second part has ever been good, and others that enough has been already
written about Don Quixote, it is thought there will be no second part;
though some, who are jovial rather than saturnine, say, ‘Let us have
more Quixotades, let Don Quixote charge and Sancho chatter, and no matter
what it may turn out, we shall be satisfied with that.’”
</p>
<p>
“And what does the author mean to do?” said Don Quixote.
</p>
<p>
“What?” replied Samson; “why, as soon as he has found
the history which he is now searching for with extraordinary diligence, he
will at once give it to the press, moved more by the profit that may
accrue to him from doing so than by any thought of praise.”
</p>
<p>
Whereat Sancho observed, “The author looks for money and profit,
does he? It will be a wonder if he succeeds, for it will be only hurry,
hurry, with him, like the tailor on Easter Eve; and works done in a hurry
are never finished as perfectly as they ought to be. Let master Moor, or
whatever he is, pay attention to what he is doing, and I and my master
will give him as much grouting ready to his hand, in the way of adventures
and accidents of all sorts, as would make up not only one second part, but
a hundred. The good man fancies, no doubt, that we are fast asleep in the
straw here, but let him hold up our feet to be shod and he will see which
foot it is we go lame on. All I say is, that if my master would take my
advice, we would be now afield, redressing outrages and righting wrongs,
as is the use and custom of good knights-errant.”
</p>
<p>
Sancho had hardly uttered these words when the neighing of Rocinante fell
upon their ears, which neighing Don Quixote accepted as a happy omen, and
he resolved to make another sally in three or four days from that time.
Announcing his intention to the bachelor, he asked his advice as to the
quarter in which he ought to commence his expedition, and the bachelor
replied that in his opinion he ought to go to the kingdom of Aragon, and
the city of Saragossa, where there were to be certain solemn joustings at
the festival of St. George, at which he might win renown above all the
knights of Aragon, which would be winning it above all the knights of the
world. He commended his very praiseworthy and gallant resolution, but
admonished him to proceed with greater caution in encountering dangers,
because his life did not belong to him, but to all those who had need of
him to protect and aid them in their misfortunes.
</p>
<p>
“There’s where it is, what I abominate, Señor Samson,”
said Sancho here; “my master will attack a hundred armed men as a
greedy boy would half a dozen melons. Body of the world, señor bachelor!
there is a time to attack and a time to retreat, and it is not to be
always ‘Santiago, and close Spain!’ Moreover, I have heard it
said (and I think by my master himself, if I remember rightly) that the
mean of valour lies between the extremes of cowardice and rashness; and if
that be so, I don’t want him to fly without having good reason, or
to attack when the odds make it better not. But, above all things, I warn
my master that if he is to take me with him it must be on the condition
that he is to do all the fighting, and that I am not to be called upon to
do anything except what concerns keeping him clean and comfortable; in
this I will dance attendance on him readily; but to expect me to draw
sword, even against rascally churls of the hatchet and hood, is idle. I
don’t set up to be a fighting man, Señor Samson, but only the best
and most loyal squire that ever served knight-errant; and if my master Don
Quixote, in consideration of my many faithful services, is pleased to give
me some island of the many his worship says one may stumble on in these
parts, I will take it as a great favour; and if he does not give it to me,
I was born like everyone else, and a man must not live in dependence on
anyone except God; and what is more, my bread will taste as well, and
perhaps even better, without a government than if I were a governor; and
how do I know but that in these governments the devil may have prepared
some trip for me, to make me lose my footing and fall and knock my
grinders out? Sancho I was born and Sancho I mean to die. But for all
that, if heaven were to make me a fair offer of an island or something
else of the kind, without much trouble and without much risk, I am not
such a fool as to refuse it; for they say, too, ‘when they offer
thee a heifer, run with a halter; and ‘when good luck comes to thee,
take it in.’”
</p>
<p>
“Brother Sancho,” said Carrasco, “you have spoken like a
professor; but, for all that, put your trust in God and in Señor Don
Quixote, for he will give you a kingdom, not to say an island.”
</p>
<p>
“It is all the same, be it more or be it less,” replied
Sancho; “though I can tell Señor Carrasco that my master would not
throw the kingdom he might give me into a sack all in holes; for I have
felt my own pulse and I find myself sound enough to rule kingdoms and
govern islands; and I have before now told my master as much.”
</p>
<p>
“Take care, Sancho,” said Samson; “honours change
manners, and perhaps when you find yourself a governor you won’t
know the mother that bore you.”
</p>
<p>
“That may hold good of those that are born in the ditches,”
said Sancho, “not of those who have the fat of an old Christian four
fingers deep on their souls, as I have. Nay, only look at my disposition,
is that likely to show ingratitude to anyone?”
</p>
<p>
“God grant it,” said Don Quixote; “we shall see when the
government comes; and I seem to see it already.”
</p>
<p>
He then begged the bachelor, if he were a poet, to do him the favour of
composing some verses for him conveying the farewell he meant to take of
his lady Dulcinea del Toboso, and to see that a letter of her name was
placed at the beginning of each line, so that, at the end of the verses,
“Dulcinea del Toboso” might be read by putting together the
first letters. The bachelor replied that although he was not one of the
famous poets of Spain, who were, they said, only three and a half, he
would not fail to compose the required verses; though he saw a great
difficulty in the task, as the letters which made up the name were
seventeen; so, if he made four ballad stanzas of four lines each, there
would be a letter over, and if he made them of five, what they called
decimas or redondillas, there were three letters short; nevertheless he
would try to drop a letter as well as he could, so that the name “Dulcinea
del Toboso” might be got into four ballad stanzas.
</p>
<p>
“It must be, by some means or other,” said Don Quixote,
“for unless the name stands there plain and manifest, no woman would
believe the verses were made for her.”
</p>
<p>
They agreed upon this, and that the departure should take place in three
days from that time. Don Quixote charged the bachelor to keep it a secret,
especially from the curate and Master Nicholas, and from his niece and the
housekeeper, lest they should prevent the execution of his praiseworthy
and valiant purpose. Carrasco promised all, and then took his leave,
charging Don Quixote to inform him of his good or evil fortunes whenever
he had an opportunity; and thus they bade each other farewell, and Sancho
went away to make the necessary preparations for their expedition.

<p>
The translator of this history, when he comes to write this fifth chapter,
says that he considers it apocryphal, because in it Sancho Panza speaks in
a style unlike that which might have been expected from his limited
intelligence, and says things so subtle that he does not think it possible
he could have conceived them; however, desirous of doing what his task
imposed upon him, he was unwilling to leave it untranslated, and therefore
he went on to say:
</p>
<p>
Sancho came home in such glee and spirits that his wife noticed his
happiness a bowshot off, so much so that it made her ask him, “What
have you got, Sancho friend, that you are so glad?”
</p>
<p>
To which he replied, “Wife, if it were God’s will, I should be
very glad not to be so well pleased as I show myself.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t understand you, husband,” said she, “and
I don’t know what you mean by saying you would be glad, if it were
God’s will, not to be well pleased; for, fool as I am, I don’t
know how one can find pleasure in not having it.”
</p>
<p>
“Hark ye, Teresa,” replied Sancho, “I am glad because I
have made up my mind to go back to the service of my master Don Quixote,
who means to go out a third time to seek for adventures; and I am going
with him again, for my necessities will have it so, and also the hope that
cheers me with the thought that I may find another hundred crowns like
those we have spent; though it makes me sad to have to leave thee and the
children; and if God would be pleased to let me have my daily bread,
dry-shod and at home, without taking me out into the byways and
cross-roads—and he could do it at small cost by merely willing it—it
is clear my happiness would be more solid and lasting, for the happiness I
have is mingled with sorrow at leaving thee; so that I was right in saying
I would be glad, if it were God’s will, not to be well pleased.”
</p>
<p>
“Look here, Sancho,” said Teresa; “ever since you joined
on to a knight-errant you talk in such a roundabout way that there is no
understanding you.”
</p>
<p>
“It is enough that God understands me, wife,” replied Sancho;
“for he is the understander of all things; that will do; but mind,
sister, you must look to Dapple carefully for the next three days, so that
he may be fit to take arms; double his feed, and see to the pack-saddle
and other harness, for it is not to a wedding we are bound, but to go
round the world, and play at give and take with giants and dragons and
monsters, and hear hissings and roarings and bellowings and howlings; and
even all this would be lavender, if we had not to reckon with Yanguesans
and enchanted Moors.”
</p>
<p>
“I know well enough, husband,” said Teresa, “that
squires-errant don’t eat their bread for nothing, and so I will be
always praying to our Lord to deliver you speedily from all that hard
fortune.”
</p>
<p>
“I can tell you, wife,” said Sancho, “if I did not
expect to see myself governor of an island before long, I would drop down
dead on the spot.”
</p>
<p>
“Nay, then, husband,” said Teresa; “let the hen live,
though it be with her pip, live, and let the devil take all the
governments in the world; you came out of your mother’s womb without
a government, you have lived until now without a government, and when it
is God’s will you will go, or be carried, to your grave without a
government. How many there are in the world who live without a government,
and continue to live all the same, and are reckoned in the number of the
people. The best sauce in the world is hunger, and as the poor are never
without that, they always eat with a relish. But mind, Sancho, if by good
luck you should find yourself with some government, don’t forget me
and your children. Remember that Sanchico is now full fifteen, and it is
right he should go to school, if his uncle the abbot has a mind to have
him trained for the Church. Consider, too, that your daughter Mari-Sancha
will not die of grief if we marry her; for I have my suspicions that she
is as eager to get a husband as you to get a government; and, after all, a
daughter looks better ill married than well whored.”
</p>
<p>
“By my faith,” replied Sancho, “if God brings me to get
any sort of a government, I intend, wife, to make such a high match for
Mari-Sancha that there will be no approaching her without calling her
‘my lady.”
</p>
<p>
“Nay, Sancho,” returned Teresa; “marry her to her equal,
that is the safest plan; for if you put her out of wooden clogs into
high-heeled shoes, out of her grey flannel petticoat into hoops and silk
gowns, out of the plain ‘Marica’ and ‘thou,’ into
‘Doña So-and-so’ and ‘my lady,’ the girl won’t
know where she is, and at every turn she will fall into a thousand
blunders that will show the thread of her coarse homespun stuff.”
</p>
<p>
“Tut, you fool,” said Sancho; “it will be only to
practise it for two or three years; and then dignity and decorum will fit
her as easily as a glove; and if not, what matter? Let her be ‘my
lady,’ and never mind what happens.”
</p>
<p>
“Keep to your own station, Sancho,” replied Teresa; “don’t
try to raise yourself higher, and bear in mind the proverb that says,
‘wipe the nose of your neigbbour’s son, and take him into your
house.’ A fine thing it would be, indeed, to marry our Maria to some
great count or grand gentleman, who, when the humour took him, would abuse
her and call her clown-bred and clodhopper’s daughter and spinning
wench. I have not been bringing up my daughter for that all this time, I
can tell you, husband. Do you bring home money, Sancho, and leave marrying
her to my care; there is Lope Tocho, Juan Tocho’s son, a stout,
sturdy young fellow that we know, and I can see he does not look sour at
the girl; and with him, one of our own sort, she will be well married, and
we shall have her always under our eyes, and be all one family, parents
and children, grandchildren and sons-in-law, and the peace and blessing of
God will dwell among us; so don’t you go marrying her in those
courts and grand palaces where they won’t know what to make of her,
or she what to make of herself.”
</p>
<p>
“Why, you idiot and wife for Barabbas,” said Sancho, “what
do you mean by trying, without why or wherefore, to keep me from marrying
my daughter to one who will give me grandchildren that will be called
‘your lordship’? Look ye, Teresa, I have always heard my
elders say that he who does not know how to take advantage of luck when it
comes to him, has no right to complain if it gives him the go-by; and now
that it is knocking at our door, it will not do to shut it out; let us go
with the favouring breeze that blows upon us.”
</p>
<p>
It is this sort of talk, and what Sancho says lower down, that made the
translator of the history say he considered this chapter apocryphal.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t you see, you animal,” continued Sancho, “that
it will be well for me to drop into some profitable government that will
lift us out of the mire, and marry Mari-Sancha to whom I like; and you
yourself will find yourself called ‘Doña Teresa Panza,’ and
sitting in church on a fine carpet and cushions and draperies, in spite
and in defiance of all the born ladies of the town? No, stay as you are,
growing neither greater nor less, like a tapestry figure—Let us say
no more about it, for Sanchica shall be a countess, say what you will.”
</p>
<p>
“Are you sure of all you say, husband?” replied Teresa.
“Well, for all that, I am afraid this rank of countess for my
daughter will be her ruin. You do as you like, make a duchess or a
princess of her, but I can tell you it will not be with my will and
consent. I was always a lover of equality, brother, and I can’t bear
to see people give themselves airs without any right. They called me
Teresa at my baptism, a plain, simple name, without any additions or tags
or fringes of Dons or Doñas; Cascajo was my father’s name, and as I
am your wife, I am called Teresa Panza, though by right I ought to be
called Teresa Cascajo; but ‘kings go where laws like,’ and I
am content with this name without having the ‘Don’ put on top
of it to make it so heavy that I cannot carry it; and I don’t want
to make people talk about me when they see me go dressed like a countess
or governor’s wife; for they will say at once, ‘See what airs
the slut gives herself! Only yesterday she was always spinning flax, and
used to go to mass with the tail of her petticoat over her head instead of
a mantle, and there she goes to-day in a hooped gown with her broaches and
airs, as if we didn’t know her!’ If God keeps me in my seven
senses, or five, or whatever number I have, I am not going to bring myself
to such a pass; go you, brother, and be a government or an island man, and
swagger as much as you like; for by the soul of my mother, neither my
daughter nor I are going to stir a step from our village; a respectable
woman should have a broken leg and keep at home; and to be busy at
something is a virtuous damsel’s holiday; be off to your adventures
along with your Don Quixote, and leave us to our misadventures, for God
will mend them for us according as we deserve it. I don’t know, I’m
sure, who fixed the ‘Don’ to him, what neither his father nor
grandfather ever had.”
</p>
<p>
“I declare thou hast a devil of some sort in thy body!” said
Sancho. “God help thee, what a lot of things thou hast strung
together, one after the other, without head or tail! What have Cascajo,
and the broaches and the proverbs and the airs, to do with what I say?
Look here, fool and dolt (for so I may call you, when you don’t
understand my words, and run away from good fortune), if I had said that
my daughter was to throw herself down from a tower, or go roaming the
world, as the Infanta Doña Urraca wanted to do, you would be right in not
giving way to my will; but if in an instant, in less than the twinkling of
an eye, I put the ‘Don’ and ‘my lady’ on her back,
and take her out of the stubble, and place her under a canopy, on a dais,
and on a couch, with more velvet cushions than all the Almohades of
Morocco ever had in their family, why won’t you consent and fall in
with my wishes?”
</p>
<p>
“Do you know why, husband?” replied Teresa; “because of
the proverb that says ‘who covers thee, discovers thee.’ At
the poor man people only throw a hasty glance; on the rich man they fix
their eyes; and if the said rich man was once on a time poor, it is then
there is the sneering and the tattle and spite of backbiters; and in the
streets here they swarm as thick as bees.”
</p>
<p>
“Look here, Teresa,” said Sancho, “and listen to what I
am now going to say to you; maybe you never heard it in all your life; and
I do not give my own notions, for what I am about to say are the opinions
of his reverence the preacher, who preached in this town last Lent, and
who said, if I remember rightly, that all things present that our eyes
behold, bring themselves before us, and remain and fix themselves on our
memory much better and more forcibly than things past.”
</p>
<p>
These observations which Sancho makes here are the other ones on account of
which the translator says he regards this chapter as apocryphal, inasmuch
as they are beyond Sancho’s capacity.
</p>
<p>
“Whence it arises,” he continued, “that when we see any
person well dressed and making a figure with rich garments and retinue of
servants, it seems to lead and impel us perforce to respect him, though
memory may at the same moment recall to us some lowly condition in which
we have seen him, but which, whether it may have been poverty or low
birth, being now a thing of the past, has no existence; while the only
thing that has any existence is what we see before us; and if this person
whom fortune has raised from his original lowly state (these were the very
words the padre used) to his present height of prosperity, be well bred,
generous, courteous to all, without seeking to vie with those whose
nobility is of ancient date, depend upon it, Teresa, no one will remember
what he was, and everyone will respect what he is, except indeed the
envious, from whom no fair fortune is safe.”
</p>
<p>
“I do not understand you, husband,” replied Teresa; “do
as you like, and don’t break my head with any more speechifying and
rethoric; and if you have revolved to do what you say—”
</p>
<p>
“Resolved, you should say, woman,” said Sancho, “not
revolved.”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t set yourself to wrangle with me, husband,” said
Teresa; “I speak as God pleases, and don’t deal in
out-of-the-way phrases; and I say if you are bent upon having a
government, take your son Sancho with you, and teach him from this time on
how to hold a government; for sons ought to inherit and learn the trades
of their fathers.”
</p>
<p>
“As soon as I have the government,” said Sancho, “I will
send for him by post, and I will send thee money, of which I shall have no
lack, for there is never any want of people to lend it to governors when
they have not got it; and do thou dress him so as to hide what he is and
make him look what he is to be.”
</p>
<p>
“You send the money,” said Teresa, “and I’ll dress
him up for you as fine as you please.”
</p>
<p>
“Then we are agreed that our daughter is to be a countess,”
said Sancho.
</p>
<p>
“The day that I see her a countess,” replied Teresa, “it
will be the same to me as if I was burying her; but once more I say do as
you please, for we women are born to this burden of being obedient to our
husbands, though they be dogs;” and with this she began to weep in
earnest, as if she already saw Sanchica dead and buried.
</p>
<p>
Sancho consoled her by saying that though he must make her a countess, he
would put it off as long as possible. Here their conversation came to an
end, and Sancho went back to see Don Quixote, and make arrangements for
their departure.

<p>
While Sancho Panza and his wife, Teresa Cascajo, held the above irrelevant
conversation, Don Quixote’s niece and housekeeper were not idle, for
by a thousand signs they began to perceive that their uncle and master
meant to give them the slip the third time, and once more betake himself
to his, for them, ill-errant chivalry. They strove by all the means in
their power to divert him from such an unlucky scheme; but it was all
preaching in the desert and hammering cold iron. Nevertheless, among many
other representations made to him, the housekeeper said to him, “In
truth, master, if you do not keep still and stay quiet at home, and give
over roaming mountains and valleys like a troubled spirit, looking for
what they say are called adventures, but what I call misfortunes, I shall
have to make complaint to God and the king with loud supplication to send
some remedy.”
</p>
<p>
To which Don Quixote replied, “What answer God will give to your
complaints, housekeeper, I know not, nor what his Majesty will answer
either; I only know that if I were king I should decline to answer the
numberless silly petitions they present every day; for one of the greatest
among the many troubles kings have is being obliged to listen to all and
answer all, and therefore I should be sorry that any affairs of mine
should worry him.”
</p>
<p>
Whereupon the housekeeper said, “Tell us, señor, at his Majesty’s
court are there no knights?”
</p>
<p>
“There are,” replied Don Quixote, “and plenty of them;
and it is right there should be, to set off the dignity of the prince, and
for the greater glory of the king’s majesty.”
</p>
<p>
“Then might not your worship,” said she, “be one of
those that, without stirring a step, serve their king and lord in his
court?”
</p>
<p>
“Recollect, my friend,” said Don Quixote, “all knights
cannot be courtiers, nor can all courtiers be knights-errant, nor need
they be. There must be all sorts in the world; and though we may be all
knights, there is a great difference between one and another; for the
courtiers, without quitting their chambers, or the threshold of the court,
range the world over by looking at a map, without its costing them a
farthing, and without suffering heat or cold, hunger or thirst; but we,
the true knights-errant, measure the whole earth with our own feet,
exposed to the sun, to the cold, to the air, to the inclemencies of
heaven, by day and night, on foot and on horseback; nor do we only know
enemies in pictures, but in their own real shapes; and at all risks and on
all occasions we attack them, without any regard to childish points or
rules of single combat, whether one has or has not a shorter lance or
sword, whether one carries relics or any secret contrivance about him,
whether or not the sun is to be divided and portioned out, and other
niceties of the sort that are observed in set combats of man to man, that
you know nothing about, but I do. And you must know besides, that the true
knight-errant, though he may see ten giants, that not only touch the
clouds with their heads but pierce them, and that go, each of them, on two
tall towers by way of legs, and whose arms are like the masts of mighty
ships, and each eye like a great mill-wheel, and glowing brighter than a
glass furnace, must not on any account be dismayed by them. On the
contrary, he must attack and fall upon them with a gallant bearing and a
fearless heart, and, if possible, vanquish and destroy them, even though
they have for armour the shells of a certain fish, that they say are
harder than diamonds, and in place of swords wield trenchant blades of
Damascus steel, or clubs studded with spikes also of steel, such as I have
more than once seen. All this I say, housekeeper, that you may see the
difference there is between the one sort of knight and the other; and it
would be well if there were no prince who did not set a higher value on
this second, or more properly speaking first, kind of knights-errant; for,
as we read in their histories, there have been some among them who have
been the salvation, not merely of one kingdom, but of many.”
</p>
<p>
“Ah, señor,” here exclaimed the niece, “remember that
all this you are saying about knights-errant is fable and fiction; and
their histories, if indeed they were not burned, would deserve, each of
them, to have a sambenito put on it, or some mark by which it might be
known as infamous and a corrupter of good manners.”
</p>
<p>
“By the God that gives me life,” said Don Quixote, “if
thou wert not my full niece, being daughter of my own sister, I would
inflict a chastisement upon thee for the blasphemy thou hast uttered that
all the world should ring with. What! can it be that a young hussy that
hardly knows how to handle a dozen lace-bobbins dares to wag her tongue
and criticise the histories of knights-errant? What would Señor Amadis say
if he heard of such a thing? He, however, no doubt would forgive thee, for
he was the most humble-minded and courteous knight of his time, and
moreover a great protector of damsels; but some there are that might have
heard thee, and it would not have been well for thee in that case; for
they are not all courteous or mannerly; some are ill-conditioned
scoundrels; nor is it everyone that calls himself a gentleman, that is so
in all respects; some are gold, others pinchbeck, and all look like
gentlemen, but not all can stand the touchstone of truth. There are men of
low rank who strain themselves to bursting to pass for gentlemen, and high
gentlemen who, one would fancy, were dying to pass for men of low rank;
the former raise themselves by their ambition or by their virtues, the
latter debase themselves by their lack of spirit or by their vices; and
one has need of experience and discernment to distinguish these two kinds
of gentlemen, so much alike in name and so different in conduct.”
</p>
<p>
“God bless me!” said the niece, “that you should know so
much, uncle—enough, if need be, to get up into a pulpit and go
preach in the streets—and yet that you should fall into a delusion
so great and a folly so manifest as to try to make yourself out vigorous
when you are old, strong when you are sickly, able to put straight what is
crooked when you yourself are bent by age, and, above all, a caballero
when you are not one; for though gentlefolk may be so, poor men are
nothing of the kind!”
</p>
<p>
“There is a great deal of truth in what you say, niece,”
returned Don Quixote, “and I could tell you somewhat about birth
that would astonish you; but, not to mix up things human and divine, I
refrain. Look you, my dears, all the lineages in the world (attend to what
I am saying) can be reduced to four sorts, which are these: those that had
humble beginnings, and went on spreading and extending themselves until
they attained surpassing greatness; those that had great beginnings and
maintained them, and still maintain and uphold the greatness of their
origin; those, again, that from a great beginning have ended in a point
like a pyramid, having reduced and lessened their original greatness till
it has come to nought, like the point of a pyramid, which, relatively to
its base or foundation, is nothing; and then there are those—and it
is they that are the most numerous—that have had neither an
illustrious beginning nor a remarkable mid-course, and so will have an end
without a name, like an ordinary plebeian line. Of the first, those that
had an humble origin and rose to the greatness they still preserve, the
Ottoman house may serve as an example, which from an humble and lowly
shepherd, its founder, has reached the height at which we now see it. For
examples of the second sort of lineage, that began with greatness and
maintains it still without adding to it, there are the many princes who
have inherited the dignity, and maintain themselves in their inheritance,
without increasing or diminishing it, keeping peacefully within the limits
of their states. Of those that began great and ended in a point, there are
thousands of examples, for all the Pharaohs and Ptolemies of Egypt, the
Cæsars of Rome, and the whole herd (if I may apply such a word to them)
of countless princes, monarchs, lords, Medes, Assyrians, Persians, Greeks,
and barbarians, all these lineages and lordships have ended in a point and
come to nothing, they themselves as well as their founders, for it would
be impossible now to find one of their descendants, and, even should we
find one, it would be in some lowly and humble condition. Of plebeian
lineages I have nothing to say, save that they merely serve to swell the
number of those that live, without any eminence to entitle them to any
fame or praise beyond this. From all I have said I would have you gather,
my poor innocents, that great is the confusion among lineages, and that
only those are seen to be great and illustrious that show themselves so by
the virtue, wealth, and generosity of their possessors. I have said
virtue, wealth, and generosity, because a great man who is vicious will be
a great example of vice, and a rich man who is not generous will be merely
a miserly beggar; for the possessor of wealth is not made happy by
possessing it, but by spending it, and not by spending as he pleases, but
by knowing how to spend it well. The poor gentleman has no way of showing
that he is a gentleman but by virtue, by being affable, well-bred,
courteous, gentle-mannered, and kindly, not haughty, arrogant, or
censorious, but above all by being charitable; for by two maravedis given
with a cheerful heart to the poor, he will show himself as generous as he
who distributes alms with bell-ringing, and no one that perceives him to
be endowed with the virtues I have named, even though he know him not,
will fail to recognise and set him down as one of good blood; and it would
be strange were it not so; praise has ever been the reward of virtue, and
those who are virtuous cannot fail to receive commendation. There are two
roads, my daughters, by which men may reach wealth and honours; one is
that of letters, the other that of arms. I have more of arms than of
letters in my composition, and, judging by my inclination to arms, was
born under the influence of the planet Mars. I am, therefore, in a measure
constrained to follow that road, and by it I must travel in spite of all
the world, and it will be labour in vain for you to urge me to resist what
heaven wills, fate ordains, reason requires, and, above all, my own
inclination favours; for knowing as I do the countless toils that are the
accompaniments of knight-errantry, I know, too, the infinite blessings
that are attained by it; I know that the path of virtue is very narrow,
and the road of vice broad and spacious; I know their ends and goals are
different, for the broad and easy road of vice ends in death, and the
narrow and toilsome one of virtue in life, and not transitory life, but in
that which has no end; I know, as our great Castilian poet says, that-
</p>
<p class="poem">
It is by rugged paths like these they go<br>
That scale the heights of immortality,<br>
Unreached by those that falter here below.”
</p>
<p>
“Woe is me!” exclaimed the niece, “my lord is a poet,
too! He knows everything, and he can do everything; I will bet, if he
chose to turn mason, he could make a house as easily as a cage.”
</p>
<p>
“I can tell you, niece,” replied Don Quixote, “if these
chivalrous thoughts did not engage all my faculties, there would be
nothing that I could not do, nor any sort of knickknack that would not
come from my hands, particularly cages and tooth-picks.”
</p>
<p>
At this moment there came a knocking at the door, and when they asked who
was there, Sancho Panza made answer that it was he. The instant the
housekeeper knew who it was, she ran to hide herself so as not to see him;
in such abhorrence did she hold him. The niece let him in, and his master
Don Quixote came forward to receive him with open arms, and the pair shut
themselves up in his room, where they had another conversation not
inferior to the previous one.

<p>
The instant the housekeeper saw Sancho Panza shut himself in with her
master, she guessed what they were about; and suspecting that the result
of the consultation would be a resolve to undertake a third sally, she
seized her mantle, and in deep anxiety and distress, ran to find the
bachelor Samson Carrasco, as she thought that, being a well-spoken man,
and a new friend of her master’s, he might be able to persuade him
to give up any such crazy notion. She found him pacing the patio of his
house, and, perspiring and flurried, she fell at his feet the moment she
saw him.
</p>
<p>
Carrasco, seeing how distressed and overcome she was, said to her, “What
is this, mistress housekeeper? What has happened to you? One would think
you heart-broken.”
</p>
<p>
“Nothing, Señor Samson,” said she, “only that my master
is breaking out, plainly breaking out.”
</p>
<p>
“Whereabouts is he breaking out, señora?” asked Samson;
“has any part of his body burst?”
</p>
<p>
“He is only breaking out at the door of his madness,” she
replied; “I mean, dear señor bachelor, that he is going to break out
again (and this will be the third time) to hunt all over the world for
what he calls ventures, though I can’t make out why he gives them
that name. The first time he was brought back to us slung across the back
of an ass, and belaboured all over; and the second time he came in an
ox-cart, shut up in a cage, in which he persuaded himself he was
enchanted, and the poor creature was in such a state that the mother that
bore him would not have known him; lean, yellow, with his eyes sunk deep
in the cells of his skull; so that to bring him round again, ever so
little, cost me more than six hundred eggs, as God knows, and all the
world, and my hens too, that won’t let me tell a lie.”
</p>
<p>
“That I can well believe,” replied the bachelor, “for
they are so good and so fat, and so well-bred, that they would not say one
thing for another, though they were to burst for it. In short then,
mistress housekeeper, that is all, and there is nothing the matter, except
what it is feared Don Quixote may do?”
</p>
<p>
“No, señor,” said she.
</p>
<p>
“Well then,” returned the bachelor, “don’t be
uneasy, but go home in peace; get me ready something hot for breakfast,
and while you are on the way say the prayer of Santa Apollonia, that is if
you know it; for I will come presently and you will see miracles.”
</p>
<p>
“Woe is me,” cried the housekeeper, “is it the prayer of
Santa Apollonia you would have me say? That would do if it was the
toothache my master had; but it is in the brains, what he has got.”
</p>
<p>
“I know what I am saying, mistress housekeeper; go, and don’t
set yourself to argue with me, for you know I am a bachelor of Salamanca,
and one can’t be more of a bachelor than that,” replied
Carrasco; and with this the housekeeper retired, and the bachelor went to
look for the curate, and arrange with him what will be told in its proper
place.
</p>
<p>
While Don Quixote and Sancho were shut up together, they had a discussion
which the history records with great precision and scrupulous exactness.
Sancho said to his master, “Señor, I have educed my wife to let me
go with your worship wherever you choose to take me.”
</p>
<p>
“Induced, you should say, Sancho,” said Don Quixote; “not
educed.”
</p>
<p>
“Once or twice, as well as I remember,” replied Sancho,
“I have begged of your worship not to mend my words, if so be as you
understand what I mean by them; and if you don’t understand them to
say ‘Sancho,’ or ‘devil,’ ‘I don’t
understand thee; and if I don’t make my meaning plain, then you may
correct me, for I am so focile—”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t understand thee, Sancho,” said Don Quixote at
once; “for I know not what ‘I am so focile’ means.”
</p>
<p>
“‘So focile’ means I am so much that way,” replied
Sancho.
</p>
<p>
“I understand thee still less now,” said Don Quixote.
</p>
<p>
“Well, if you can’t understand me,” said Sancho, “I
don’t know how to put it; I know no more, God help me.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, now I have hit it,” said Don Quixote; “thou wouldst
say thou art so docile, tractable, and gentle that thou wilt take what I
say to thee, and submit to what I teach thee.”
</p>
<p>
“I would bet,” said Sancho, “that from the very first
you understood me, and knew what I meant, but you wanted to put me out
that you might hear me make another couple of dozen blunders.”
</p>
<p>
“May be so,” replied Don Quixote; “but to come to the
point, what does Teresa say?”
</p>
<p>
“Teresa says,” replied Sancho, “that I should make sure
with your worship, and ‘let papers speak and beards be still,’
for ‘he who binds does not wrangle,’ since one ‘take’
is better than two ‘I’ll give thee’s;’ and I say a
woman’s advice is no great thing, and he who won’t take it is
a fool.”
</p>
<p>
“And so say I,” said Don Quixote; “continue, Sancho my
friend; go on; you talk pearls to-day.”
</p>
<p>
“The fact is,” continued Sancho, “that, as your worship
knows better than I do, we are all of us liable to death, and to-day we
are, and to-morrow we are not, and the lamb goes as soon as the sheep, and
nobody can promise himself more hours of life in this world than God may
be pleased to give him; for death is deaf, and when it comes to knock at
our life’s door, it is always urgent, and neither prayers, nor
struggles, nor sceptres, nor mitres, can keep it back, as common talk and
report say, and as they tell us from the pulpits every day.”
</p>
<p>
“All that is very true,” said Don Quixote; “but I cannot
make out what thou art driving at.”
</p>
<p>
“What I am driving at,” said Sancho, “is that your
worship settle some fixed wages for me, to be paid monthly while I am in
your service, and that the same be paid me out of your estate; for I don’t
care to stand on rewards which either come late, or ill, or never at all;
God help me with my own. In short, I would like to know what I am to get,
be it much or little; for the hen will lay on one egg, and many littles
make a much, and so long as one gains something there is nothing lost. To
be sure, if it should happen (what I neither believe nor expect) that your
worship were to give me that island you have promised me, I am not so
ungrateful nor so grasping but that I would be willing to have the revenue
of such island valued and stopped out of my wages in due promotion.”
</p>
<p>
“Sancho, my friend,” replied Don Quixote, “sometimes
proportion may be as good as promotion.”
</p>
<p>
“I see,” said Sancho; “I’ll bet I ought to have
said proportion, and not promotion; but it is no matter, as your worship
has understood me.”
</p>
<p>
“And so well understood,” returned Don Quixote, “that I have
seen into the depths of thy thoughts, and know the mark thou art shooting at
with the countless shafts of thy proverbs. Look here, Sancho, I would readily
fix thy wages if I had ever found any instance in the histories of the
knights-errant to show or indicate, by the slightest hint, what their squires
used to get monthly or yearly; but I have read all or the best part of their
histories, and I cannot remember reading of any knight-errant having assigned
fixed wages to his squire; I only know that they all served on reward, and that
when they least expected it, if good luck attended their masters, they found
themselves recompensed with an island or something equivalent to it, or at the
least they were left with a title and lordship. If with these hopes and
additional inducements you, Sancho, please to return to my service, well and
good; but to suppose that I am going to disturb or unhinge the ancient usage of
knight-errantry, is all nonsense. And so, my Sancho, get you back to your house
and explain my intentions to your Teresa, and if she likes and you like to be
on reward with me, <i>bene quidem;</i> if not, we remain friends; for if the
pigeon-house does not lack food, it will not lack pigeons; and bear in mind, my
son, that a good hope is better than a bad holding, and a good grievance better
than a bad compensation. I speak in this way, Sancho, to show you that I can
shower down proverbs just as well as yourself; and in short, I mean to say, and
I do say, that if you don’t like to come on reward with me, and run the
same chance that I run, God be with you and make a saint of you; for I shall
find plenty of squires more obedient and painstaking, and not so thickheaded or
talkative as you are.”
</p>
<p>
When Sancho heard his master’s firm, resolute language, a cloud came
over the sky with him and the wings of his heart drooped, for he had made
sure that his master would not go without him for all the wealth of the
world; and as he stood there dumbfoundered and moody, Samson Carrasco came
in with the housekeeper and niece, who were anxious to hear by what
arguments he was about to dissuade their master from going to seek
adventures. The arch wag Samson came forward, and embracing him as he had
done before, said with a loud voice, “O flower of knight-errantry! O
shining light of arms! O honour and mirror of the Spanish nation! may God
Almighty in his infinite power grant that any person or persons, who would
impede or hinder thy third sally, may find no way out of the labyrinth of
their schemes, nor ever accomplish what they most desire!” And then,
turning to the housekeeper, he said, “Mistress housekeeper may just
as well give over saying the prayer of Santa Apollonia, for I know it is
the positive determination of the spheres that Señor Don Quixote shall
proceed to put into execution his new and lofty designs; and I should lay
a heavy burden on my conscience did I not urge and persuade this knight
not to keep the might of his strong arm and the virtue of his valiant
spirit any longer curbed and checked, for by his inactivity he is
defrauding the world of the redress of wrongs, of the protection of
orphans, of the honour of virgins, of the aid of widows, and of the
support of wives, and other matters of this kind appertaining, belonging,
proper and peculiar to the order of knight-errantry. On, then, my lord Don
Quixote, beautiful and brave, let your worship and highness set out to-day
rather than to-morrow; and if anything be needed for the execution of your
purpose, here am I ready in person and purse to supply the want; and were
it requisite to attend your magnificence as squire, I should esteem it the
happiest good fortune.”
</p>
<p>
At this, Don Quixote, turning to Sancho, said, “Did I not tell thee,
Sancho, there would be squires enough and to spare for me? See now who
offers to become one; no less than the illustrious bachelor Samson
Carrasco, the perpetual joy and delight of the courts of the Salamancan
schools, sound in body, discreet, patient under heat or cold, hunger or
thirst, with all the qualifications requisite to make a knight-errant’s
squire! But heaven forbid that, to gratify my own inclination, I should
shake or shatter this pillar of letters and vessel of the sciences, and
cut down this towering palm of the fair and liberal arts. Let this new
Samson remain in his own country, and, bringing honour to it, bring honour
at the same time on the grey heads of his venerable parents; for I will be
content with any squire that comes to hand, as Sancho does not deign to
accompany me.”
</p>
<p>
“I do deign,” said Sancho, deeply moved and with tears in his
eyes; “it shall not be said of me, master mine,” he continued,
“‘the bread eaten and the company dispersed.’ Nay, I
come of no ungrateful stock, for all the world knows, but particularly my
own town, who the Panzas from whom I am descended were; and, what is more,
I know and have learned, by many good words and deeds, your worship’s
desire to show me favour; and if I have been bargaining more or less about
my wages, it was only to please my wife, who, when she sets herself to
press a point, no hammer drives the hoops of a cask as she drives one to
do what she wants; but, after all, a man must be a man, and a woman a
woman; and as I am a man anyhow, which I can’t deny, I will be one
in my own house too, let who will take it amiss; and so there’s
nothing more to do but for your worship to make your will with its codicil
in such a way that it can’t be provoked, and let us set out at once,
to save Señor Samson’s soul from suffering, as he says his
conscience obliges him to persuade your worship to sally out upon the
world a third time; so I offer again to serve your worship faithfully and
loyally, as well and better than all the squires that served
knights-errant in times past or present.”
</p>
<p>
The bachelor was filled with amazement when he heard Sancho’s
phraseology and style of talk, for though he had read the first part of
his master’s history he never thought that he could be so droll as
he was there described; but now, hearing him talk of a “will and
codicil that could not be provoked,” instead of “will and
codicil that could not be revoked,” he believed all he had read of
him, and set him down as one of the greatest simpletons of modern times;
and he said to himself that two such lunatics as master and man the world
had never seen. In fine, Don Quixote and Sancho embraced one another and
made friends, and by the advice and with the approval of the great
Carrasco, who was now their oracle, it was arranged that their departure
should take place three days thence, by which time they could have all
that was requisite for the journey ready, and procure a closed helmet,
which Don Quixote said he must by all means take. Samson offered him one,
as he knew a friend of his who had it would not refuse it to him, though
it was more dingy with rust and mildew than bright and clean like
burnished steel.
</p>
<p>
The curses which both housekeeper and niece poured out on the bachelor
were past counting; they tore their hair, they clawed their faces, and in
the style of the hired mourners that were once in fashion, they raised a
lamentation over the departure of their master and uncle, as if it had
been his death. Samson’s intention in persuading him to sally forth
once more was to do what the history relates farther on; all by the advice
of the curate and barber, with whom he had previously discussed the
subject. Finally, then, during those three days, Don Quixote and Sancho
provided themselves with what they considered necessary, and Sancho having
pacified his wife, and Don Quixote his niece and housekeeper, at
nightfall, unseen by anyone except the bachelor, who thought fit to
accompany them half a league out of the village, they set out for El
Toboso, Don Quixote on his good Rocinante and Sancho on his old Dapple,
his alforjas furnished with certain matters in the way of victuals, and
his purse with money that Don Quixote gave him to meet emergencies. Samson
embraced him, and entreated him to let him hear of his good or evil
fortunes, so that he might rejoice over the former or condole with him
over the latter, as the laws of friendship required. Don Quixote promised
him he would do so, and Samson returned to the village, and the other two
took the road for the great city of El Toboso.

“Blessed be Allah the all-powerful!” says Hamete Benengeli on
beginning this eighth chapter; “blessed be Allah!” he repeats
three times; and he says he utters these thanksgivings at seeing that he
has now got Don Quixote and Sancho fairly afield, and that the readers of
his delightful history may reckon that the achievements and humours of Don
Quixote and his squire are now about to begin; and he urges them to forget
the former chivalries of the ingenious gentleman and to fix their eyes on
those that are to come, which now begin on the road to El Toboso, as the
others began on the plains of Montiel; nor is it much that he asks in
consideration of all he promises, and so he goes on to say:
</p>
<p>
Don Quixote and Sancho were left alone, and the moment Samson took his
departure, Rocinante began to neigh, and Dapple to sigh, which, by both
knight and squire, was accepted as a good sign and a very happy omen;
though, if the truth is to be told, the sighs and brays of Dapple were
louder than the neighings of the hack, from which Sancho inferred that his
good fortune was to exceed and overtop that of his master, building,
perhaps, upon some judicial astrology that he may have known, though the
history says nothing about it; all that can be said is, that when he
stumbled or fell, he was heard to say he wished he had not come out, for
by stumbling or falling there was nothing to be got but a damaged shoe or
a broken rib; and, fool as he was, he was not much astray in this.
