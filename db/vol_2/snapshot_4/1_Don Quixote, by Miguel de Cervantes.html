commonplace character of all the surroundings and circumstances that gives
a significance to Don Quixote’s vigil and the ceremony that follows.
</p>
<p>
Cervantes’ humour is for the most part of that broader and simpler sort,
the strength of which lies in the perception of the incongruous. It is the
incongruity of Sancho in all his ways, words, and works, with the ideas
and aims of his master, quite as much as the wonderful vitality and truth
to nature of the character, that makes him the most humorous creation in
the whole range of fiction. That unsmiling gravity of which Cervantes was
the first great master, “Cervantes’ serious air,” which sits naturally on
Swift alone, perhaps, of later humourists, is essential to this kind of
humour, and here again Cervantes has suffered at the hands of his
interpreters. Nothing, unless indeed the coarse buffoonery of Phillips,
could be more out of place in an attempt to represent Cervantes, than a
flippant, would-be facetious style, like that of Motteux’s version for
example, or the sprightly, jaunty air, French translators sometimes adopt.
It is the grave matter-of-factness of the narrative, and the apparent
unconsciousness of the author that he is saying anything ludicrous,
anything but the merest commonplace, that give its peculiar flavour to the
humour of Cervantes. His, in fact, is the exact opposite of the humour of
Sterne and the self-conscious humourists. Even when Uncle Toby is at his
best, you are always aware of “the man Sterne” behind him, watching you
over his shoulder to see what effect he is producing. Cervantes always
leaves you alone with Don Quixote and Sancho. He and Swift and the great
humourists always keep themselves out of sight, or, more properly
speaking, never think about themselves at all, unlike our latter-day
school of humourists, who seem to have revived the old horse-collar
method, and try to raise a laugh by some grotesque assumption of
ignorance, imbecility, or bad taste.
</p>
<p>
It is true that to do full justice to Spanish humour in any other language
is well-nigh an impossibility. There is a natural gravity and a sonorous
stateliness about Spanish, be it ever so colloquial, that make an
absurdity doubly absurd, and give plausibility to the most preposterous
statement. This is what makes Sancho Panza’s drollery the despair of the
conscientious translator. Sancho’s curt comments can never fall flat, but
they lose half their flavour when transferred from their native Castilian
into any other medium. But if foreigners have failed to do justice to the
humour of Cervantes, they are no worse than his own countrymen. Indeed,
were it not for the Spanish peasant’s relish of “Don Quixote,” one might
be tempted to think that the great humourist was not looked upon as a
humourist at all in his own country.
</p>
<p>
The craze of Don Quixote seems, in some instances, to have communicated
itself to his critics, making them see things that are not in the book and
run full tilt at phantoms that have no existence save in their own
imaginations. Like a good many critics now-a-days, they forget that
screams are not criticism, and that it is only vulgar tastes that are
influenced by strings of superlatives, three-piled hyperboles, and pompous
epithets. But what strikes one as particularly strange is that while they
deal in extravagant eulogies, and ascribe all manner of imaginary ideas
and qualities to Cervantes, they show no perception of the quality that
ninety-nine out of a hundred of his readers would rate highest in him, and
hold to be the one that raises him above all rivalry.
</p>
<p>
To speak of “Don Quixote” as if it were merely a humorous book would be a
manifest misdescription. Cervantes at times makes it a kind of commonplace
book for occasional essays and criticisms, or for the observations and
reflections and gathered wisdom of a long and stirring life. It is a mine
of shrewd observation on mankind and human nature. Among modern novels
there may be, here and there, more elaborate studies of character, but
there is no book richer in individualised character. What Coleridge said
of Shakespeare in minimis is true of Cervantes; he never, even for the
most temporary purpose, puts forward a lay figure. There is life and
individuality in all his characters, however little they may have to do,
or however short a time they may be before the reader. Samson Carrasco,
the curate, Teresa Panza, Altisidora, even the two students met on the
road to the cave of Montesinos, all live and move and have their being;
and it is characteristic of the broad humanity of Cervantes that there is
not a hateful one among them all. Even poor Maritornes, with her
deplorable morals, has a kind heart of her own and “some faint and distant
resemblance to a Christian about her;” and as for Sancho, though on
dissection we fail to find a lovable trait in him, unless it be a sort of
dog-like affection for his master, who is there that in his heart does not
love him?
</p>
<p>
But it is, after all, the humour of “Don Quixote” that distinguishes it
from all other books of the romance kind. It is this that makes it, as one
of the most judicial-minded of modern critics calls it, “the best novel in
the world beyond all comparison.” It is its varied humour, ranging from
broad farce to comedy as subtle as Shakespeare’s or Molière’s that has
naturalised it in every country where there are readers, and made it a
classic in every language that has a literature.

<h3><a id="pref05"></a>THE AUTHOR’S PREFACE</h3>
<p>
Idle reader: thou mayest believe me without any oath that I would this
book, as it is the child of my brain, were the fairest, gayest, and
cleverest that could be imagined. But I could not counteract Nature’s law
that everything shall beget its like; and what, then, could this sterile,
illtilled wit of mine beget but the story of a dry, shrivelled, whimsical
offspring, full of thoughts of all sorts and such as never came into any
other imagination—just what might be begotten in a prison, where
every misery is lodged and every doleful sound makes its dwelling?
Tranquillity, a cheerful retreat, pleasant fields, bright skies, murmuring
brooks, peace of mind, these are the things that go far to make even the
most barren muses fertile, and bring into the world births that fill it
with wonder and delight. Sometimes when a father has an ugly, loutish son,
the love he bears him so blindfolds his eyes that he does not see his
defects, or, rather, takes them for gifts and charms of mind and body, and
talks of them to his friends as wit and grace. I, however—for though
I pass for the father, I am but the stepfather to “Don Quixote”—have
no desire to go with the current of custom, or to implore thee, dearest
reader, almost with tears in my eyes, as others do, to pardon or excuse
the defects thou wilt perceive in this child of mine. Thou art neither its
kinsman nor its friend, thy soul is thine own and thy will as free as any
man’s, whate’er he be, thou art in thine own house and master of it as
much as the king of his taxes and thou knowest the common saying, “Under
my cloak I kill the king;” all which exempts and frees thee from every
consideration and obligation, and thou canst say what thou wilt of the
story without fear of being abused for any ill or rewarded for any good
thou mayest say of it.
</p>
<p>
My wish would be simply to present it to thee plain and unadorned, without
any embellishment of preface or uncountable muster of customary sonnets,
epigrams, and eulogies, such as are commonly put at the beginning of
books. For I can tell thee, though composing it cost me some labour, I
found none greater than the making of this Preface thou art now reading.
Many times did I take up my pen to write it, and many did I lay it down
again, not knowing what to write. One of these times, as I was pondering
with the paper before me, a pen in my ear, my elbow on the desk, and my
cheek in my hand, thinking of what I should say, there came in
unexpectedly a certain lively, clever friend of mine, who, seeing me so
deep in thought, asked the reason; to which I, making no mystery of it,
answered that I was thinking of the Preface I had to make for the story of
“Don Quixote,” which so troubled me that I had a mind not to make any at
all, nor even publish the achievements of so noble a knight.
</p>
<p>
“For, how could you expect me not to feel uneasy about what that ancient
lawgiver they call the Public will say when it sees me, after slumbering
so many years in the silence of oblivion, coming out now with all my years
upon my back, and with a book as dry as a rush, devoid of invention,
meagre in style, poor in thoughts, wholly wanting in learning and wisdom,
without quotations in the margin or annotations at the end, after the
fashion of other books I see, which, though all fables and profanity, are
so full of maxims from Aristotle, and Plato, and the whole herd of
philosophers, that they fill the readers with amazement and convince them
that the authors are men of learning, erudition, and eloquence. And then,
when they quote the Holy Scriptures!—anyone would say they are St.
Thomases or other doctors of the Church, observing as they do a decorum so
ingenious that in one sentence they describe a distracted lover and in the
next deliver a devout little sermon that it is a pleasure and a treat to
hear and read. Of all this there will be nothing in my book, for I have
nothing to quote in the margin or to note at the end, and still less do I
know what authors I follow in it, to place them at the beginning, as all
do, under the letters A, B, C, beginning with Aristotle and ending with
Xenophon, or Zoilus, or Zeuxis, though one was a slanderer and the other a
painter. Also my book must do without sonnets at the beginning, at least
sonnets whose authors are dukes, marquises, counts, bishops, ladies, or
famous poets. Though if I were to ask two or three obliging friends, I
know they would give me them, and such as the productions of those that
have the highest reputation in our Spain could not equal.
</p>
<p>
“In short, my friend,” I continued, “I am determined that Señor Don
Quixote shall remain buried in the archives of his own La Mancha until
Heaven provide someone to garnish him with all those things he stands in
need of; because I find myself, through my shallowness and want of
learning, unequal to supplying them, and because I am by nature shy and
careless about hunting for authors to say what I myself can say without
them. Hence the cogitation and abstraction you found me in, and reason
enough, what you have heard from me.”
</p>
<p>
Hearing this, my friend, giving himself a slap on the forehead and
breaking into a hearty laugh, exclaimed, “Before God, Brother, now am I
disabused of an error in which I have been living all this long time I
have known you, all through which I have taken you to be shrewd and
sensible in all you do; but now I see you are as far from that as the
heaven is from the earth. Is it possible that things of so little moment
and so easy to set right can occupy and perplex a ripe wit like yours, fit
to break through and crush far greater obstacles? By my faith, this comes,
not of any want of ability, but of too much indolence and too little
knowledge of life. Do you want to know if I am telling the truth? Well,
then, attend to me, and you will see how, in the opening and shutting of
an eye, I sweep away all your difficulties, and supply all those
deficiencies which you say check and discourage you from bringing before
the world the story of your famous Don Quixote, the light and mirror of
all knight-errantry.”
</p>
<p>
“Say on,” said I, listening to his talk; “how do you propose to make up
for my diffidence, and reduce to order this chaos of perplexity I am in?”
</p>
<p>
To which he made answer, “Your first difficulty about the sonnets,
epigrams, or complimentary verses which you want for the beginning, and
which ought to be by persons of importance and rank, can be removed if you
yourself take a little trouble to make them; you can afterwards baptise
them, and put any name you like to them, fathering them on Prester John of
the Indies or the Emperor of Trebizond, who, to my knowledge, were said to
have been famous poets: and even if they were not, and any pedants or
bachelors should attack you and question the fact, never care two
maravedis for that, for even if they prove a lie against you they cannot
cut off the hand you wrote it with.
</p>
<p>
“As to references in the margin to the books and authors from whom you
take the aphorisms and sayings you put into your story, it is only
contriving to fit in nicely any sentences or scraps of Latin you may
happen to have by heart, or at any rate that will not give you much
trouble to look up; so as, when you speak of freedom and captivity, to
insert
</p>
<p class="poem">
<i>Non bene pro toto libertas venditur auro;</i>
</p>
<p class="noindent">
and then refer in the margin to Horace, or whoever said it; or, if you
allude to the power of death, to come in with—
</p>
<p class="poem">
<i>Pallida mors æquo pulsat pede pauperum tabernas,<br>
Regumque turres.</i>
</p>
<p class="noindent">
“If it be friendship and the love God bids us bear to our enemy, go at
once to the Holy Scriptures, which you can do with a very small amount of
research, and quote no less than the words of God himself: <i>Ego autem dico
vobis: diligite inimicos vestros.</i> If you speak of evil thoughts, turn to
the Gospel: <i>De corde exeunt cogitationes malæ.</i> If of the fickleness of
friends, there is Cato, who will give you his distich:
</p>
<p class="poem">
<i>Donec eris felix multos numerabis amicos,<br>
Tempora si fuerint nubila, solus eris.</i>
</p>
<p class="noindent">
“With these and such like bits of Latin they will take you for a
grammarian at all events, and that now-a-days is no small honour and
profit.
</p>
<p>
“With regard to adding annotations at the end of the book, you may safely
do it in this way. If you mention any giant in your book contrive that it
shall be the giant Goliath, and with this alone, which will cost you
almost nothing, you have a grand note, for you can put—<i>The giant
Golias or Goliath was a Philistine whom the shepherd David slew by a
mighty stone-cast in the Terebinth valley, as is related in the Book of
Kings</i>—in the chapter where you find it written.
</p>
<p>
“Next, to prove yourself a man of erudition in polite literature and
cosmography, manage that the river Tagus shall be named in your story, and
there you are at once with another famous annotation, setting forth—<i>The
river Tagus was so called after a King of Spain: it has its source in such
and such a place and falls into the ocean, kissing the walls of the famous
city of Lisbon, and it is a common belief that it has golden sands</i>, etc.
If you should have anything to do with robbers, I will give you the story
of Cacus, for I have it by heart; if with loose women, there is the Bishop
of Mondonedo, who will give you the loan of Lamia, Laida, and Flora, any
reference to whom will bring you great credit; if with hard-hearted ones,
Ovid will furnish you with Medea; if with witches or enchantresses, Homer
has Calypso, and Virgil Circe; if with valiant captains, Julius Cæsar
himself will lend you himself in his own ‘Commentaries,’ and Plutarch will
give you a thousand Alexanders. If you should deal with love, with two
ounces you may know of Tuscan you can go to Leon the Hebrew, who will
supply you to your heart’s content; or if you should not care to go to
foreign countries you have at home Fonseca’s ‘Of the Love of God,’ in
which is condensed all that you or the most imaginative mind can want on
the subject. In short, all you have to do is to manage to quote these
names, or refer to these stories I have mentioned, and leave it to me to
insert the annotations and quotations, and I swear by all that’s good to
fill your margins and use up four sheets at the end of the book.
</p>
<p>
“Now let us come to those references to authors which other books have,
and you want for yours. The remedy for this is very simple: You have only
to look out for some book that quotes them all, from A to Z as you say
yourself, and then insert the very same alphabet in your book, and though
the imposition may be plain to see, because you have so little need to
borrow from them, that is no matter; there will probably be some simple
enough to believe that you have made use of them all in this plain,
artless story of yours. At any rate, if it answers no other purpose, this
long catalogue of authors will serve to give a surprising look of
authority to your book. Besides, no one will trouble himself to verify
whether you have followed them or whether you have not, being no way
concerned in it; especially as, if I mistake not, this book of yours has
no need of any one of those things you say it wants, for it is, from
beginning to end, an attack upon the books of chivalry, of which Aristotle
never dreamt, nor St. Basil said a word, nor Cicero had any knowledge; nor
do the niceties of truth nor the observations of astrology come within the
range of its fanciful vagaries; nor have geometrical measurements or
refutations of the arguments used in rhetoric anything to do with it; nor
does it mean to preach to anybody, mixing up things human and divine, a
sort of motley in which no Christian understanding should dress itself. It
has only to avail itself of truth to nature in its composition, and the
more perfect the imitation the better the work will be. And as this piece
of yours aims at nothing more than to destroy the authority and influence
which books of chivalry have in the world and with the public, there is no
<p>
need for you to go a-begging for aphorisms from philosophers, precepts
from Holy Scripture, fables from poets, speeches from orators, or miracles
from saints; but merely to take care that your style and diction run
musically, pleasantly, and plainly, with clear, proper, and well-placed
words, setting forth your purpose to the best of your power, and putting
your ideas intelligibly, without confusion or obscurity. Strive, too, that
in reading your story the melancholy may be moved to laughter, and the
merry made merrier still; that the simple shall not be wearied, that the
judicious shall admire the invention, that the grave shall not despise it,
nor the wise fail to praise it. Finally, keep your aim fixed on the
destruction of that ill-founded edifice of the books of chivalry, hated by
some and praised by many more; for if you succeed in this you will have
achieved no small success.”
</p>
<p>
In profound silence I listened to what my friend said, and his
observations made such an impression on me that, without attempting to
question them, I admitted their soundness, and out of them I determined to
make this Preface; wherein, gentle reader, thou wilt perceive my friend’s
good sense, my good fortune in finding such an adviser in such a time of
need, and what thou hast gained in receiving, without addition or
alteration, the story of the famous Don Quixote of La Mancha, who is held
by all the inhabitants of the district of the Campo de Montiel to have
been the chastest lover and the bravest knight that has for many years
been seen in that neighbourhood. I have no desire to magnify the service I
render thee in making thee acquainted with so renowned and honoured a
knight, but I do desire thy thanks for the acquaintance thou wilt make
with the famous Sancho Panza, his squire, in whom, to my thinking, I have
given thee condensed all the squirely drolleries that are scattered
through the swarm of the vain books of chivalry. And so—may God give
thee health, and not forget me. Vale.

In belief of the good reception and honours that Your Excellency bestows
on all sort of books, as prince so inclined to favor good arts, chiefly
those who by their nobleness do not submit to the service and bribery of
the vulgar, I have determined bringing to light The Ingenious Gentleman
Don Quixote of la Mancha, in shelter of Your Excellency’s glamorous name,
to whom, with the obeisance I owe to such grandeur, I pray to receive it
agreeably under his protection, so that in this shadow, though deprived of
that precious ornament of elegance and erudition that clothe the works
composed in the houses of those who know, it dares appear with assurance
in the judgment of some who, trespassing the bounds of their own
ignorance, use to condemn with more rigour and less justice the writings
of others. It is my earnest hope that Your Excellency’s good counsel in
regard to my honourable purpose, will not disdain the littleness of so
humble a service.

</p>
<p>
In a village of La Mancha, the name of which I have no desire to call to
mind, there lived not long since one of those gentlemen that keep a lance
in the lance-rack, an old buckler, a lean hack, and a greyhound for
coursing. An olla of rather more beef than mutton, a salad on most nights,
scraps on Saturdays, lentils on Fridays, and a pigeon or so extra on
Sundays, made away with three-quarters of his income. The rest of it went
in a doublet of fine cloth and velvet breeches and shoes to match for
holidays, while on week-days he made a brave figure in his best homespun.
He had in his house a housekeeper past forty, a niece under twenty, and a
lad for the field and market-place, who used to saddle the hack as well as
handle the bill-hook. The age of this gentleman of ours was bordering on
fifty; he was of a hardy habit, spare, gaunt-featured, a very early riser
and a great sportsman. They will have it his surname was Quixada or
Quesada (for here there is some difference of opinion among the authors
who write on the subject), although from reasonable conjectures it seems
plain that he was called Quexana. This, however, is of but little
“That Cervantes has been for many years a great friend of mine, and to my
importance to our tale; it will be enough not to stray a hair’s breadth
from the truth in the telling of it.
</p>
<p>
You must know, then, that the above-named gentleman whenever he was at
leisure (which was mostly all the year round) gave himself up to reading
books of chivalry with such ardour and avidity that he almost entirely
neglected the pursuit of his field-sports, and even the management of his
property; and to such a pitch did his eagerness and infatuation go that he
sold many an acre of tillageland to buy books of chivalry to read, and
brought home as many of them as he could get. But of all there were none
he liked so well as those of the famous Feliciano de Silva’s composition,
for their lucidity of style and complicated conceits were as pearls in his
sight, particularly when in his reading he came upon courtships and
cartels, where he often found passages like “<i>the reason of the unreason
with which my reason is afflicted so weakens my reason that with reason I
murmur at your beauty;” or again, “the high heavens, that of your divinity
divinely fortify you with the stars, render you deserving of the desert
your greatness deserves</i>.” Over conceits of this sort the poor gentleman
lost his wits, and used to lie awake striving to understand them and worm
the meaning out of them; what Aristotle himself could not have made out or
extracted had he come to life again for that special purpose. He was not
at all easy about the wounds which Don Belianis gave and took, because it
seemed to him that, great as were the surgeons who had cured him, he must
have had his face and body covered all over with seams and scars. He
commended, however, the author’s way of ending his book with the promise
of that interminable adventure, and many a time was he tempted to take up
his pen and finish it properly as is there proposed, which no doubt he
would have done, and made a successful piece of work of it too, had not
greater and more absorbing thoughts prevented him.
</p>
<p>
Many an argument did he have with the curate of his village (a learned
man, and a graduate of Siguenza) as to which had been the better knight,
Palmerin of England or Amadis of Gaul. Master Nicholas, the village
barber, however, used to say that neither of them came up to the Knight of
Phœbus, and that if there was any that could compare with <i>him</i> it was Don
Galaor, the brother of Amadis of Gaul, because he had a spirit that was
equal to every occasion, and was no finikin knight, nor lachrymose like
his brother, while in the matter of valour he was not a whit behind him.
In short, he became so absorbed in his books that he spent his nights from
sunset to sunrise, and his days from dawn to dark, poring over them; and
what with little sleep and much reading his brains got so dry that he lost
his wits. His fancy grew full of what he used to read about in his books,
enchantments, quarrels, battles, challenges, wounds, wooings, loves,
agonies, and all sorts of impossible nonsense; and it so possessed his
mind that the whole fabric of invention and fancy he read of was true,
that to him no history in the world had more reality in it. He used to say
the Cid Ruy Diaz was a very good knight, but that he was not to be
compared with the Knight of the Burning Sword who with one back-stroke cut
in half two fierce and monstrous giants. He thought more of Bernardo del
Carpio because at Roncesvalles he slew Roland in spite of enchantments,
availing himself of the artifice of Hercules when he strangled Antæus the
son of Terra in his arms. He approved highly of the giant Morgante,
because, although of the giant breed which is always arrogant and
ill-conditioned, he alone was affable and well-bred. But above all he
admired Reinaldos of Montalban, especially when he saw him sallying forth
from his castle and robbing everyone he met, and when beyond the seas he
stole that image of Mahomet which, as his history says, was entirely of
gold. To have a bout of kicking at that traitor of a Ganelon he would have
given his housekeeper, and his niece into the bargain.
</p>
<p>
In short, his wits being quite gone, he hit upon the strangest notion that
ever madman in this world hit upon, and that was that he fancied it was
right and requisite, as well for the support of his own honour as for the
service of his country, that he should make a knight-errant of himself,
roaming the world over in full armour and on horseback in quest of
adventures, and putting in practice himself all that he had read of as
being the usual practices of knights-errant; righting every kind of wrong,
and exposing himself to peril and danger from which, in the issue, he was
to reap eternal renown and fame. Already the poor man saw himself crowned
by the might of his arm Emperor of Trebizond at least; and so, led away by
the intense enjoyment he found in these pleasant fancies, he set himself
forthwith to put his scheme into execution.
</p>
<p>
The first thing he did was to clean up some armour that had belonged to
his great-grandfather, and had been for ages lying forgotten in a corner
eaten with rust and covered with mildew. He scoured and polished it as
best he could, but he perceived one great defect in it, that it had no
closed helmet, nothing but a simple morion. This deficiency, however, his
ingenuity supplied, for he contrived a kind of half-helmet of pasteboard
which, fitted on to the morion, looked like a whole one. It is true that,
in order to see if it was strong and fit to stand a cut, he drew his sword
and gave it a couple of slashes, the first of which undid in an instant
what had taken him a week to do. The ease with which he had knocked it to
pieces disconcerted him somewhat, and to guard against that danger he set
to work again, fixing bars of iron on the inside until he was satisfied
with its strength; and then, not caring to try any more experiments with
it, he passed it and adopted it as a helmet of the most perfect
construction.
</p>
<p>
He next proceeded to inspect his hack, which, with more quartos than a
real and more blemishes than the steed of Gonela, that “<i>tantum pellis et
ossa fuit</i>,” surpassed in his eyes the Bucephalus of Alexander or the
Babieca of the Cid. Four days were spent in thinking what name to give
him, because (as he said to himself) it was not right that a horse
belonging to a knight so famous, and one with such merits of his own,
should be without some distinctive name, and he strove to adapt it so as
to indicate what he had been before belonging to a knight-errant, and what
he then was; for it was only reasonable that, his master taking a new
character, he should take a new name, and that it should be a
distinguished and full-sounding one, befitting the new order and calling
he was about to follow. And so, after having composed, struck out,
rejected, added to, unmade, and remade a multitude of names out of his
memory and fancy, he decided upon calling him Rocinante, a name, to his
thinking, lofty, sonorous, and significant of his condition as a hack
before he became what he now was, the first and foremost of all the hacks
in the world.
</p>
<p>
Having got a name for his horse so much to his taste, he was anxious to
get one for himself, and he was eight days more pondering over this point,
till at last he made up his mind to call himself “Don Quixote,” whence, as
has been already said, the authors of this veracious history have inferred
that his name must have been beyond a doubt Quixada, and not Quesada as
others would have it. Recollecting, however, that the valiant Amadis was
not content to call himself curtly Amadis and nothing more, but added the
name of his kingdom and country to make it famous, and called himself
Amadis of Gaul, he, like a good knight, resolved to add on the name of
his, and to style himself Don Quixote of La Mancha, whereby, he
considered, he described accurately his origin and country, and did honour
to it in taking his surname from it.
</p>
<p>
So then, his armour being furbished, his morion turned into a helmet, his
hack christened, and he himself confirmed, he came to the conclusion that
nothing more was needed now but to look out for a lady to be in love with;
for a knight-errant without love was like a tree without leaves or fruit,
or a body without a soul. As he said to himself, “If, for my sins, or by
my good fortune, I come across some giant hereabouts, a common occurrence
with knights-errant, and overthrow him in one onslaught, or cleave him
asunder to the waist, or, in short, vanquish and subdue him, will it not
be well to have someone I may send him to as a present, that he may come
in and fall on his knees before my sweet lady, and in a humble, submissive
voice say, ‘I am the giant Caraculiambro, lord of the island of
Malindrania, vanquished in single combat by the never sufficiently
extolled knight Don Quixote of La Mancha, who has commanded me to present
myself before your Grace, that your Highness dispose of me at your
pleasure’?” Oh, how our good gentleman enjoyed the delivery of this
speech, especially when he had thought of someone to call his Lady! There
was, so the story goes, in a village near his own a very good-looking
farm-girl with whom he had been at one time in love, though, so far as is
known, she never knew it nor gave a thought to the matter. Her name was
Aldonza Lorenzo, and upon her he thought fit to confer the title of Lady
of his Thoughts; and after some search for a name which should not be out
of harmony with her own, and should suggest and indicate that of a
princess and great lady, he decided upon calling her Dulcinea del Toboso—she
being of El Toboso—a name, to his mind, musical, uncommon, and
significant, like all those he had already bestowed upon himself and the
things belonging to him.

These preliminaries settled, he did not care to put off any longer the
execution of his design, urged on to it by the thought of all the world
was losing by his delay, seeing what wrongs he intended to right,
grievances to redress, injustices to repair, abuses to remove, and duties
to discharge. So, without giving notice of his intention to anyone, and
without anybody seeing him, one morning before the dawning of the day
(which was one of the hottest of the month of July) he donned his suit of
armour, mounted Rocinante with his patched-up helmet on, braced his
buckler, took his lance, and by the back door of the yard sallied forth
upon the plain in the highest contentment and satisfaction at seeing with
what ease he had made a beginning with his grand purpose. But scarcely did
he find himself upon the open plain, when a terrible thought struck him,
one all but enough to make him abandon the enterprise at the very outset.
It occurred to him that he had not been dubbed a knight, and that
according to the law of chivalry he neither could nor ought to bear arms
against any knight; and that even if he had been, still he ought, as a
novice knight, to wear white armour, without a device upon the shield
until by his prowess he had earned one. These reflections made him waver
in his purpose, but his craze being stronger than any reasoning, he made
up his mind to have himself dubbed a knight by the first one he came
across, following the example of others in the same case, as he had read
in the books that brought him to this pass. As for white armour, he
resolved, on the first opportunity, to scour his until it was whiter than
an ermine; and so comforting himself he pursued his way, taking that which
his horse chose, for in this he believed lay the essence of adventures.
</p>
<p>
Thus setting out, our new-fledged adventurer paced along, talking to
himself and saying, “Who knows but that in time to come, when the
veracious history of my famous deeds is made known, the sage who writes
it, when he has to set forth my first sally in the early morning, will do
it after this fashion? ‘Scarce had the rubicund Apollo spread o’er the
face of the broad spacious earth the golden threads of his bright hair,
scarce had the little birds of painted plumage attuned their notes to hail
with dulcet and mellifluous harmony the coming of the rosy Dawn, that,
deserting the soft couch of her jealous spouse, was appearing to mortals
at the gates and balconies of the Manchegan horizon, when the renowned
knight Don Quixote of La Mancha, quitting the lazy down, mounted his
celebrated steed Rocinante and began to traverse the ancient and famous
Campo de Montiel;’” which in fact he was actually traversing. “Happy the
age, happy the time,” he continued, “in which shall be made known my deeds
of fame, worthy to be moulded in brass, carved in marble, limned in
pictures, for a memorial for ever. And thou, O sage magician, whoever thou
art, to whom it shall fall to be the chronicler of this wondrous history,
forget not, I entreat thee, my good Rocinante, the constant companion of
my ways and wanderings.” Presently he broke out again, as if he were
love-stricken in earnest, “O Princess Dulcinea, lady of this captive
heart, a grievous wrong hast thou done me to drive me forth with scorn,
and with inexorable obduracy banish me from the presence of thy beauty. O
lady, deign to hold in remembrance this heart, thy vassal, that thus in
anguish pines for love of thee.”
</p>
<p>
So he went on stringing together these and other absurdities, all in the style
of those his books had taught him, imitating their language as well as he
could; and all the while he rode so slowly and the sun mounted so rapidly and
with such fervour that it was enough to melt his brains if he had any. Nearly
all day he travelled without anything remarkable happening to him, at which he
was in despair, for he was anxious to encounter someone at once upon whom to
try the might of his strong arm.

<br><br><br>
</p>
<p>
Writers there are who say the first adventure he met with was that of
Puerto Lapice; others say it was that of the windmills; but what I have
ascertained on this point, and what I have found written in the annals of
La Mancha, is that he was on the road all day, and towards nightfall his
hack and he found themselves dead tired and hungry, when, looking all
around to see if he could discover any castle or shepherd’s shanty where
he might refresh himself and relieve his sore wants, he perceived not far
out of his road an inn, which was as welcome as a star guiding him to the
portals, if not the palaces, of his redemption; and quickening his pace he
reached it just as night was setting in. At the door were standing two
young women, girls of the district as they call them, on their way to
Seville with some carriers who had chanced to halt that night at the inn;
and as, happen what might to our adventurer, everything he saw or imagined
seemed to him to be and to happen after the fashion of what he read of,
the moment he saw the inn he pictured it to himself as a castle with its
four turrets and pinnacles of shining silver, not forgetting the
drawbridge and moat and all the belongings usually ascribed to castles of
the sort. To this inn, which to him seemed a castle, he advanced, and at a
short distance from it he checked Rocinante, hoping that some dwarf would
show himself upon the battlements, and by sound of trumpet give notice
that a knight was approaching the castle. But seeing that they were slow
about it, and that Rocinante was in a hurry to reach the stable, he made
for the inn door, and perceived the two gay damsels who were standing
there, and who seemed to him to be two fair maidens or lovely ladies
taking their ease at the castle gate.
</p>
<p>
At this moment it so happened that a swineherd who was going through the
stubbles collecting a drove of pigs (for, without any apology, that is
what they are called) gave a blast of his horn to bring them together, and
forthwith it seemed to Don Quixote to be what he was expecting, the signal
of some dwarf announcing his arrival; and so with prodigious satisfaction
he rode up to the inn and to the ladies, who, seeing a man of this sort
approaching in full armour and with lance and buckler, were turning in
dismay into the inn, when Don Quixote, guessing their fear by their
flight, raising his pasteboard visor, disclosed his dry dusty visage, and
with courteous bearing and gentle voice addressed them, “Your ladyships
need not fly or fear any rudeness, for that it belongs not to the order of
knighthood which I profess to offer to anyone, much less to highborn
maidens as your appearance proclaims you to be.” The girls were looking at
him and straining their eyes to make out the features which the clumsy
visor obscured, but when they heard themselves called maidens, a thing so
much out of their line, they could not restrain their laughter, which made
Don Quixote wax indignant, and say, “Modesty becomes the fair, and
moreover laughter that has little cause is great silliness; this, however,
I say not to pain or anger you, for my desire is none other than to serve
you.”
</p>
<p>
The incomprehensible language and the unpromising looks of our cavalier
only increased the ladies’ laughter, and that increased his irritation,
and matters might have gone farther if at that moment the landlord had not
come out, who, being a very fat man, was a very peaceful one. He, seeing
this grotesque figure clad in armour that did not match any more than his
saddle, bridle, lance, buckler, or corselet, was not at all indisposed to
join the damsels in their manifestations of amusement; but, in truth,
standing in awe of such a complicated armament, he thought it best to
speak him fairly, so he said, “Señor Caballero, if your worship wants
lodging, bating the bed (for there is not one in the inn) there is plenty
of everything else here.” Don Quixote, observing the respectful bearing of
the Alcaide of the fortress (for so innkeeper and inn seemed in his eyes),
made answer, “Sir Castellan, for me anything will suffice, for
</p>
<p class="poem">
‘My armour is my only wear,<br>
My only rest the fray.’”
</p>
<p>
The host fancied he called him Castellan because he took him for a “worthy
of Castile,” though he was in fact an Andalusian, and one from the strand
of San Lucar, as crafty a thief as Cacus and as full of tricks as a
student or a page. “In that case,” said he,
</p>
<p class="poem">
“‘Your bed is on the flinty rock,<br>
Your sleep to watch alway;’
</p>
<p class="noindent">
and if so, you may dismount and safely reckon upon any quantity of
sleeplessness under this roof for a twelvemonth, not to say for a single
night.” So saying, he advanced to hold the stirrup for Don Quixote, who
got down with great difficulty and exertion (for he had not broken his
fast all day), and then charged the host to take great care of his horse,
as he was the best bit of flesh that ever ate bread in this world. The
landlord eyed him over but did not find him as good as Don Quixote said,
nor even half as good; and putting him up in the stable, he returned to
see what might be wanted by his guest, whom the damsels, who had by this
time made their peace with him, were now relieving of his armour. They had
taken off his breastplate and backpiece, but they neither knew nor saw how
to open his gorget or remove his make-shift helmet, for he had fastened it
with green ribbons, which, as there was no untying the knots, required to
be cut. This, however, he would not by any means consent to, so he
remained all the evening with his helmet on, the drollest and oddest
figure that can be imagined; and while they were removing his armour,
taking the baggages who were about it for ladies of high degree belonging
to the castle, he said to them with great sprightliness:
</p>
<p class="poem">
“Oh, never, surely, was there knight<br>
So served by hand of dame,<br>
As served was he, Don Quixote hight,<br>
When from his town he came;<br>
With maidens waiting on himself,<br>
Princesses on his hack—
</p>
<p class="noindent">
—or Rocinante, for that, ladies mine, is my horse’s name, and Don
Quixote of La Mancha is my own; for though I had no intention of declaring
myself until my achievements in your service and honour had made me known,
the necessity of adapting that old ballad of Lancelot to the present
occasion has given you the knowledge of my name altogether prematurely. A
time, however, will come for your ladyships to command and me to obey, and
then the might of my arm will show my desire to serve you.”
</p>
<p>
The girls, who were not used to hearing rhetoric of this sort, had nothing
to say in reply; they only asked him if he wanted anything to eat. “I
would gladly eat a bit of something,” said Don Quixote, “for I feel it
would come very seasonably.” The day happened to be a Friday, and in the
whole inn there was nothing but some pieces of the fish they call in
Castile “abadejo,” in Andalusia “bacallao,” and in some places
“curadillo,” and in others “troutlet;” so they asked him if he thought he
could eat troutlet, for there was no other fish to give him. “If there be
troutlets enough,” said Don Quixote, “they will be the same thing as a
trout; for it is all one to me whether I am given eight reals in small
change or a piece of eight; moreover, it may be that these troutlets are
like veal, which is better than beef, or kid, which is better than goat.
But whatever it be let it come quickly, for the burden and pressure of
arms cannot be borne without support to the inside.” They laid a table for
him at the door of the inn for the sake of the air, and the host brought
him a portion of ill-soaked and worse cooked stockfish, and a piece of
bread as black and mouldy as his own armour; but a laughable sight it was
to see him eating, for having his helmet on and the beaver up, he could
not with his own hands put anything into his mouth unless someone else
placed it there, and this service one of the ladies rendered him. But to
give him anything to drink was impossible, or would have been so had not
the landlord bored a reed, and putting one end in his mouth poured the
wine into him through the other; all which he bore with patience rather
than sever the ribbons of his helmet.
</p>
<p>
While this was going on there came up to the inn a sowgelder, who, as he
approached, sounded his reed pipe four or five times, and thereby
completely convinced Don Quixote that he was in some famous castle, and
that they were regaling him with music, and that the stockfish was trout,
the bread the whitest, the wenches ladies, and the landlord the castellan
of the castle; and consequently he held that his enterprise and sally had
been to some purpose. But still it distressed him to think he had not been
dubbed a knight, for it was plain to him he could not lawfully engage in
any adventure without receiving the order of knighthood.

Harassed by this reflection, he made haste with his scanty pothouse
supper, and having finished it called the landlord, and shutting himself
into the stable with him, fell on his knees before him, saying, “From this
spot I rise not, valiant knight, until your courtesy grants me the boon I
seek, one that will redound to your praise and the benefit of the human
race.” The landlord, seeing his guest at his feet and hearing a speech of
this kind, stood staring at him in bewilderment, not knowing what to do or
say, and entreating him to rise, but all to no purpose until he had agreed
to grant the boon demanded of him. “I looked for no less, my lord, from
your High Magnificence,” replied Don Quixote, “and I have to tell you that
the boon I have asked and your liberality has granted is that you shall
dub me knight to-morrow morning, and that to-night I shall watch my arms
in the chapel of this your castle; thus to-morrow, as I have said, will be
accomplished what I so much desire, enabling me lawfully to roam through
all the four quarters of the world seeking adventures on behalf of those
in distress, as is the duty of chivalry and of knights-errant like myself,
whose ambition is directed to such deeds.”
</p>
<p>
The landlord, who, as has been mentioned, was something of a wag, and had
already some suspicion of his guest’s want of wits, was quite convinced of
it on hearing talk of this kind from him, and to make sport for the night
he determined to fall in with his humour. So he told him he was quite
right in pursuing the object he had in view, and that such a motive was
natural and becoming in cavaliers as distinguished as he seemed and his
gallant bearing showed him to be; and that he himself in his younger days
had followed the same honourable calling, roaming in quest of adventures
in various parts of the world, among others the Curing-grounds of Malaga,
the Isles of Riaran, the Precinct of Seville, the Little Market of
Segovia, the Olivera of Valencia, the Rondilla of Granada, the Strand of
San Lucar, the Colt of Cordova, the Taverns of Toledo, and divers other
quarters, where he had proved the nimbleness of his feet and the lightness
of his fingers, doing many wrongs, cheating many widows, ruining maids and
swindling minors, and, in short, bringing himself under the notice of
almost every tribunal and court of justice in Spain; until at last he had
retired to this castle of his, where he was living upon his property and
upon that of others; and where he received all knights-errant of whatever
rank or condition they might be, all for the great love he bore them and
that they might share their substance with him in return for his
benevolence. He told him, moreover, that in this castle of his there was
no chapel in which he could watch his armour, as it had been pulled down
in order to be rebuilt, but that in a case of necessity it might, he knew,
be watched anywhere, and he might watch it that night in a courtyard of
the castle, and in the morning, God willing, the requisite ceremonies
might be performed so as to have him dubbed a knight, and so thoroughly
much out of their line, they could not restrain their laughter, which made
dubbed that nobody could be more so. He asked if he had any money with
him, to which Don Quixote replied that he had not a farthing, as in the
histories of knights-errant he had never read of any of them carrying any.
On this point the landlord told him he was mistaken; for, though not
recorded in the histories, because in the author’s opinion there was no
need to mention anything so obvious and necessary as money and clean
shirts, it was not to be supposed therefore that they did not carry them,
and he might regard it as certain and established that all knights-errant
(about whom there were so many full and unimpeachable books) carried
well-furnished purses in case of emergency, and likewise carried shirts
and a little box of ointment to cure the wounds they received. For in
those plains and deserts where they engaged in combat and came out
wounded, it was not always that there was someone to cure them, unless
indeed they had for a friend some sage magician to succour them at once by
fetching through the air upon a cloud some damsel or dwarf with a vial of
water of such virtue that by tasting one drop of it they were cured of
their hurts and wounds in an instant and left as sound as if they had not
received any damage whatever. But in case this should not occur, the
knights of old took care to see that their squires were provided with
money and other requisites, such as lint and ointments for healing
purposes; and when it happened that knights had no squires (which was
rarely and seldom the case) they themselves carried everything in cunning
saddle-bags that were hardly seen on the horse’s croup, as if it were
something else of more importance, because, unless for some such reason,
carrying saddle-bags was not very favourably regarded among
knights-errant. He therefore advised him (and, as his godson so soon to
be, he might even command him) never from that time forth to travel
without money and the usual requirements, and he would find the advantage
of them when he least expected it.
</p>
<p>
Don Quixote promised to follow his advice scrupulously, and it was
arranged forthwith that he should watch his armour in a large yard at one
side of the inn; so, collecting it all together, Don Quixote placed it on
a trough that stood by the side of a well, and bracing his buckler on his
arm he grasped his lance and began with a stately air to march up and down
in front of the trough, and as he began his march night began to fall.
</p>
<p>
The landlord told all the people who were in the inn about the craze of
his guest, the watching of the armour, and the dubbing ceremony he
contemplated. Full of wonder at so strange a form of madness, they flocked
to see it from a distance, and observed with what composure he sometimes
paced up and down, or sometimes, leaning on his lance, gazed on his armour
without taking his eyes off it for ever so long; and as the night closed
in with a light from the moon so brilliant that it might vie with his that
lent it, everything the novice knight did was plainly seen by all.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile one of the carriers who were in the inn thought fit to water his
team, and it was necessary to remove Don Quixote’s armour as it lay on the
trough; but he seeing the other approach hailed him in a loud voice, “O
thou, whoever thou art, rash knight that comest to lay hands on the armour
of the most valorous errant that ever girt on sword, have a care what thou
dost; touch it not unless thou wouldst lay down thy life as the penalty of
thy rashness.” The carrier gave no heed to these words (and he would have
done better to heed them if he had been heedful of his health), but
seizing it by the straps flung the armour some distance from him. Seeing
this, Don Quixote raised his eyes to heaven, and fixing his thoughts,
apparently, upon his lady Dulcinea, exclaimed, “Aid me, lady mine, in this
the first encounter that presents itself to this breast which thou holdest
in subjection; let not thy favour and protection fail me in this first
jeopardy;” and, with these words and others to the same purpose, dropping
his buckler he lifted his lance with both hands and with it smote such a
blow on the carrier’s head that he stretched him on the ground, so stunned
that had he followed it up with a second there would have been no need of
a surgeon to cure him. This done, he picked up his armour and returned to
his beat with the same serenity as before.
</p>
<p>
<br><br><br><br> <a id="p010"></a>
</p>
<div class="fig" style="width:60%;">

<br><br><br>
</p>
<p>
Shortly after this, another, not knowing what had happened (for the
carrier still lay senseless), came with the same object of giving water to
his mules, and was proceeding to remove the armour in order to clear the
trough, when Don Quixote, without uttering a word or imploring aid from
anyone, once more dropped his buckler and once more lifted his lance, and
without actually breaking the second carrier’s head into pieces, made more
than three of it, for he laid it open in four. At the noise all the people
of the inn ran to the spot, and among them the landlord. Seeing this, Don
Quixote braced his buckler on his arm, and with his hand on his sword
exclaimed, “O Lady of Beauty, strength and support of my faint heart, it
is time for thee to turn the eyes of thy greatness on this thy captive
</div>
knight on the brink of so mighty an adventure.” By this he felt himself so
inspired that he would not have flinched if all the carriers in the world
had assailed him. The comrades of the wounded perceiving the plight they
were in began from a distance to shower stones on Don Quixote, who
screened himself as best he could with his buckler, not daring to quit the
trough and leave his armour unprotected. The landlord shouted to them to
leave him alone, for he had already told them that he was mad, and as a
madman he would not be accountable even if he killed them all. Still
louder shouted Don Quixote, calling them knaves and traitors, and the lord
of the castle, who allowed knights-errant to be treated in this fashion, a
villain and a low-born knight whom, had he received the order of
knighthood, he would call to account for his treachery. “But of you,” he
cried, “base and vile rabble, I make no account; fling, strike, come on,
do all ye can against me, ye shall see what the reward of your folly and
insolence will be.” This he uttered with so much spirit and boldness that
he filled his assailants with a terrible fear, and as much for this reason
as at the persuasion of the landlord they left off stoning him, and he
allowed them to carry off the wounded, and with the same calmness and
composure as before resumed the watch over his armour.
</p>
<p>
But these freaks of his guest were not much to the liking of the landlord,
so he determined to cut matters short and confer upon him at once the
unlucky order of knighthood before any further misadventure could occur;
so, going up to him, he apologised for the rudeness which, without his
knowledge, had been offered to him by these low people, who, however, had
been well punished for their audacity. As he had already told him, he
said, there was no chapel in the castle, nor was it needed for what
remained to be done, for, as he understood the ceremonial of the order,
the whole point of being dubbed a knight lay in the accolade and in the
slap on the shoulder, and that could be administered in the middle of a
field; and that he had now done all that was needful as to watching the
armour, for all requirements were satisfied by a watch of two hours only,
while he had been more than four about it. Don Quixote believed it all,
and told him he stood there ready to obey him, and to make an end of it
with as much despatch as possible; for, if he were again attacked, and
felt himself to be dubbed knight, he would not, he thought, leave a soul
alive in the castle, except such as out of respect he might spare at his
would have done, and made a successful piece of work of it too, had not
bidding.
</p>
<p>
Thus warned and menaced, the castellan forthwith brought out a book in
which he used to enter the straw and barley he served out to the carriers,
and, with a lad carrying a candle-end, and the two damsels already
mentioned, he returned to where Don Quixote stood, and bade him kneel
down. Then, reading from his account-book as if he were repeating some
devout prayer, in the middle of his delivery he raised his hand and gave
him a sturdy blow on the neck, and then, with his own sword, a smart slap
on the shoulder, all the while muttering between his teeth as if he was
saying his prayers. Having done this, he directed one of the ladies to
gird on his sword, which she did with great self-possession and gravity,
and not a little was required to prevent a burst of laughter at each stage
of the ceremony; but what they had already seen of the novice knight’s
prowess kept their laughter within bounds. On girding him with the sword
the worthy lady said to him, “May God make your worship a very fortunate
knight, and grant you success in battle.” Don Quixote asked her name in
order that he might from that time forward know to whom he was beholden
for the favour he had received, as he meant to confer upon her some
portion of the honour he acquired by the might of his arm. She answered
with great humility that she was called La Tolosa, and that she was the
daughter of a cobbler of Toledo who lived in the stalls of Sanchobienaya,
and that wherever she might be she would serve and esteem him as her lord.
Don Quixote said in reply that she would do him a favour if thenceforward
she assumed the “Don” and called herself Doña Tolosa. She promised she
would, and then the other buckled on his spur, and with her followed
almost the same conversation as with the lady of the sword. He asked her
name, and she said it was La Molinera, and that she was the daughter of a
respectable miller of Antequera; and of her likewise Don Quixote requested
that she would adopt the “Don” and call herself Doña Molinera, making
offers to her further services and favours.
</p>
<p>
Having thus, with hot haste and speed, brought to a conclusion these
never-till-now-seen ceremonies, Don Quixote was on thorns until he saw
himself on horseback sallying forth in quest of adventures; and saddling
Rocinante at once he mounted, and embracing his host, as he returned
thanks for his kindness in knighting him, he addressed him in language so
extraordinary that it is impossible to convey an idea of it or report it.
The landlord, to get him out of the inn, replied with no less rhetoric
though with shorter words, and without calling upon him to pay the
reckoning let him go with a Godspeed.

OF WHAT HAPPENED TO OUR KNIGHT WHEN HE LEFT THE INN

</p>
<p>
Day was dawning when Don Quixote quitted the inn, so happy, so gay, so
exhilarated at finding himself now dubbed a knight, that his joy was like
to burst his horse-girths. However, recalling the advice of his host as to
the requisites he ought to carry with him, especially that referring to
money and shirts, he determined to go home and provide himself with all,
and also with a squire, for he reckoned upon securing a farm-labourer, a
neighbour of his, a poor man with a family, but very well qualified for
the office of squire to a knight. With this object he turned his horse’s
head towards his village, and Rocinante, thus reminded of his old
quarters, stepped out so briskly that he hardly seemed to tread the earth.
</p>
<p>
He had not gone far, when out of a thicket on his right there seemed to
come feeble cries as of someone in distress, and the instant he heard
them he exclaimed, “Thanks be to heaven for the favour it accords me, that
it so soon offers me an opportunity of fulfilling the obligation I have
undertaken, and gathering the fruit of my ambition. These cries, no doubt,
come from some man or woman in want of help, and needing my aid and
protection;” and wheeling, he turned Rocinante in the direction whence the
cries seemed to proceed. He had gone but a few paces into the wood, when
he saw a mare tied to an oak, and tied to another, and stripped from the
waist upwards, a youth of about fifteen years of age, from whom the cries
came. Nor were they without cause, for a lusty farmer was flogging him
with a belt and following up every blow with scoldings and commands,
repeating, “Your mouth shut and your eyes open!” while the youth made
answer, “I won’t do it again, master mine; by God’s passion I won’t do it
again, and I’ll take more care of the flock another time.”
</p>
<p>
Seeing what was going on, Don Quixote said in an angry voice,
“Discourteous knight, it ill becomes you to assail one who cannot defend
himself; mount your steed and take your lance” (for there was a lance
leaning against the oak to which the mare was tied), “and I will make you
know that you are behaving as a coward.” The farmer, seeing before him
this figure in full armour brandishing a lance over his head, gave himself
up for dead, and made answer meekly, “Sir Knight, this youth that I am
chastising is my servant, employed by me to watch a flock of sheep that I
have hard by, and he is so careless that I lose one every day, and when I
punish him for his carelessness and knavery he says I do it out of
niggardliness, to escape paying him the wages I owe him, and before God,
and on my soul, he lies.”
</p>
<p>
“Lies before me, base clown!” said Don Quixote. “By the sun that shines on
us I have a mind to run you through with this lance. Pay him at once
without another word; if not, by the God that rules us I will make an end
of you, and annihilate you on the spot; release him instantly.”
</p>
<p>
<br><br><br><br> <a id="p019"></a>
</p>
<div class="fig" style="width:60%;">

<br><br><br>
</p>
<p>
The farmer hung his head, and without a word untied his servant, of whom
Don Quixote asked how much his master owed him.
</p>
<p>
He replied, nine months at seven reals a month. Don Quixote added it up,
found that it came to sixty-three reals, and told the farmer to pay it
down immediately, if he did not want to die for it.
</p>
<p>
The trembling clown replied that as he lived and by the oath he had sworn
(though he had not sworn any) it was not so much; for there were to be
taken into account and deducted three pairs of shoes he had given him, and
a real for two blood-lettings when he was sick.
</p>
<p>
“All that is very well,” said Don Quixote; “but let the shoes and the
blood-lettings stand as a setoff against the blows you have given him
without any cause; for if he spoiled the leather of the shoes you paid
for, you have damaged that of his body, and if the barber took blood from
him when he was sick, you have drawn it when he was sound; so on that
score he owes you nothing.”
</p>
<p>
“The difficulty is, Sir Knight, that I have no money here; let Andres come
home with me, and I will pay him all, real by real.”
</p>
<p>
“I go with him!” said the youth. “Nay, God forbid! No, señor, not for the
world; for once alone with me, he would ray me like a Saint Bartholomew.”
</p>
<p>
“He will do nothing of the kind,” said Don Quixote; “I have only to
command, and he will obey me; and as he has sworn to me by the order of
knighthood which he has received, I leave him free, and I guarantee the
payment.”
</p>
<p>
“Consider what you are saying, señor,” said the youth; “this master of
mine is not a knight, nor has he received any order of knighthood; for he
is Juan Haldudo the Rich, of Quintanar.”
</p>
<p>
“That matters little,” replied Don Quixote; “there may be Haldudos
knights; moreover, everyone is the son of his works.”
</p>
<p>
“That is true,” said Andres; “but this master of mine—of what works
is he the son, when he refuses me the wages of my sweat and labour?”
</p>
<p>
“I do not refuse, brother Andres,” said the farmer, “be good enough to
come along with me, and I swear by all the orders of knighthood there are
in the world to pay you as I have agreed, real by real, and perfumed.”
</p>
<p>
“For the perfumery I excuse you,” said Don Quixote; “give it to him in
reals, and I shall be satisfied; and see that you do as you have sworn; if
not, by the same oath I swear to come back and hunt you out and punish
you; and I shall find you though you should lie closer than a lizard. And
if you desire to know who it is lays this command upon you, that you be
more firmly bound to obey it, know that I am the valorous Don Quixote of
La Mancha, the undoer of wrongs and injustices; and so, God be with you,
and keep in mind what you have promised and sworn under those penalties
that have been already declared to you.”
</p>
<p>
So saying, he gave Rocinante the spur and was soon out of reach. The
farmer followed him with his eyes, and when he saw that he had cleared the
wood and was no longer in sight, he turned to his boy Andres, and said,
“Come here, my son, I want to pay you what I owe you, as that undoer of
wrongs has commanded me.”
</p>
<p>
“My oath on it,” said Andres, “your worship will be well advised to obey
the command of that good knight—may he live a thousand years—for,
as he is a valiant and just judge, by Roque, if you do not pay me, he will
come back and do as he said.”
</p>
<p>
“My oath on it, too,” said the farmer; “but as I have a strong affection
for you, I want to add to the debt in order to add to the payment;” and
seizing him by the arm, he tied him up again, and gave him such a flogging
that he left him for dead.
</p>
<p>
“Now, Master Andres,” said the farmer, “call on the undoer of wrongs; you
will find he won’t undo that, though I am not sure that I have quite done
with you, for I have a good mind to flay you alive.” But at last he untied
him, and gave him leave to go look for his judge in order to put the
sentence pronounced into execution.
</p>
<p>
Andres went off rather down in the mouth, swearing he would go to look for
the valiant Don Quixote of La Mancha and tell him exactly what had
happened, and that all would have to be repaid him sevenfold; but for all
that, he went off weeping, while his master stood laughing.
</p>
<p>
Thus did the valiant Don Quixote right that wrong, and, thoroughly
satisfied with what had taken place, as he considered he had made a very
happy and noble beginning with his knighthood, he took the road towards
his village in perfect self-content, saying in a low voice, “Well mayest
thou this day call thyself fortunate above all on earth, O Dulcinea del
Toboso, fairest of the fair! since it has fallen to thy lot to hold
subject and submissive to thy full will and pleasure a knight so renowned
as is and will be Don Quixote of La Mancha, who, as all the world knows,
yesterday received the order of knighthood, and hath to-day righted the
greatest wrong and grievance that ever injustice conceived and cruelty
perpetrated: who hath to-day plucked the rod from the hand of yonder
ruthless oppressor so wantonly lashing that tender child.”
</p>
<p>
He now came to a road branching in four directions, and immediately he was
reminded of those cross-roads where knights-errant used to stop to
consider which road they should take. In imitation of them he halted for a
while, and after having deeply considered it, he gave Rocinante his head,
submitting his own will to that of his hack, who followed out his first
intention, which was to make straight for his own stable. After he had
gone about two miles Don Quixote perceived a large party of people, who,
as afterwards appeared, were some Toledo traders, on their way to buy silk
at Murcia. There were six of them coming along under their sunshades, with
four servants mounted, and three muleteers on foot. Scarcely had Don
Quixote descried them when the fancy possessed him that this must be some
new adventure; and to help him to imitate as far as he could those
passages he had read of in his books, here seemed to come one made on
purpose, which he resolved to attempt. So with a lofty bearing and
determination he fixed himself firmly in his stirrups, got his lance
ready, brought his buckler before his breast, and planting himself in the
middle of the road, stood waiting the approach of these knights-errant,
for such he now considered and held them to be; and when they had come
near enough to see and hear, he exclaimed with a haughty gesture, “All the
world stand, unless all the world confess that in all the world there is
no maiden fairer than the Empress of La Mancha, the peerless Dulcinea del
Toboso.”
</p>
<p>
The traders halted at the sound of this language and the sight of the
strange figure that uttered it, and from both figure and language at once
guessed the craze of their owner; they wished, however, to learn quietly
what was the object of this confession that was demanded of them, and one
of them, who was rather fond of a joke and was very sharp-witted, said to
him, “Sir Knight, we do not know who this good lady is that you speak of;
show her to us, for, if she be of such beauty as you suggest, with all our
hearts and without any pressure we will confess the truth that is on your
part required of us.”
</p>
<p>
“If I were to show her to you,” replied Don Quixote, “what merit would you
have in confessing a truth so manifest? The essential point is that
without seeing her you must believe, confess, affirm, swear, and defend
it; else ye have to do with me in battle, ill-conditioned, arrogant rabble
that ye are; and come ye on, one by one as the order of knighthood
requires, or all together as is the custom and vile usage of your breed,
here do I bide and await you relying on the justice of the cause I
maintain.”
</p>
<p>
“Sir Knight,” replied the trader, “I entreat your worship in the name of
this present company of princes, that, to save us from charging our
consciences with the confession of a thing we have never seen or heard of,
and one moreover so much to the prejudice of the Empresses and Queens of
the Alcarria and Estremadura, your worship will be pleased to show us some
portrait of this lady, though it be no bigger than a grain of wheat; for
by the thread one gets at the ball, and in this way we shall be satisfied
and easy, and you will be content and pleased; nay, I believe we are
already so far agreed with you that even though her portrait should show
her blind of one eye, and distilling vermilion and sulphur from the other,
we would nevertheless, to gratify your worship, say all in her favour that
you desire.”
</p>
<p>
“She distils nothing of the kind, vile rabble,” said Don Quixote, burning
with rage, “nothing of the kind, I say, only ambergris and civet in
cotton; nor is she one-eyed or humpbacked, but straighter than a
Guadarrama spindle: but ye must pay for the blasphemy ye have uttered
against beauty like that of my lady.”

And so saying, he charged with levelled lance against the one who had
spoken, with such fury and fierceness that, if luck had not contrived that
Rocinante should stumble midway and come down, it would have gone hard
with the rash trader. Down went Rocinante, and over went his master,
rolling along the ground for some distance; and when he tried to rise he
was unable, so encumbered was he with lance, buckler, spurs, helmet, and
the weight of his old armour; and all the while he was struggling to get
up he kept saying, “Fly not, cowards and caitiffs! stay, for not by my
fault, but my horse’s, am I stretched here.”

One of the muleteers in attendance, who could not have had much good nature in
him, hearing the poor prostrate man blustering in this style, was unable to
refrain from giving him an answer on his ribs; and coming up to him he seized
his lance, and having broken it in pieces, with one of them he began so to
belabour our Don Quixote that, notwithstanding and in spite of his armour, he
milled him like a measure of wheat. His masters called out not to lay on so
hard and to leave him alone, but the muleteer’s blood was up, and he did
not care to drop the game until he had vented the rest of his wrath, and
gathering up the remaining fragments of the lance he finished with a discharge
upon the unhappy victim, who all through the storm of sticks that rained on him
never ceased threatening heaven, and earth, and the brigands, for such they
seemed to him. At last the muleteer was tired, and the traders continued their
journey, taking with them matter for talk about the poor fellow who had been
cudgelled. He when he found himself alone made another effort to rise; but if
he was unable when whole and sound, how was he to rise after having been
thrashed and well-nigh knocked to pieces? And yet he esteemed himself
fortunate, as it seemed to him that this was a regular knight-errant’s
mishap, and entirely, he considered, the fault of his horse. However, battered
in body as he was, to rise was beyond his power.

Finding, then, that, in fact he could not move, he thought himself of
having recourse to his usual remedy, which was to think of some passage in
his books, and his craze brought to his mind that about Baldwin and the
Marquis of Mantua, when Carloto left him wounded on the mountainside, a
story known by heart by the children, not forgotten by the young men, and
lauded and even believed by the old folk; and for all that not a whit
truer than the miracles of Mahomet. This seemed to him to fit exactly the
case in which he found himself, so, making a show of severe suffering, he
began to roll on the ground and with feeble breath repeat the very words
which the wounded knight of the wood is said to have uttered:
</p>
<p class="poem">
Where art thou, lady mine, that thou<br>
My sorrow dost not rue?<br>
Thou canst not know it, lady mine,<br>
Or else thou art untrue.
</p>
<p>
And so he went on with the ballad as far as the lines:
</p>
<p class="poem">
O noble Marquis of Mantua,<br>
My Uncle and liege lord!
</p>
<p>
<br><br><br><br> <a id="p026"></a>
</p>
<div class="fig" style="width:60%;">

<br><br><br>
</p>
<p>
As chance would have it, when he had got to this line there happened to
come by a peasant from his own village, a neighbour of his, who had been
with a load of wheat to the mill, and he, seeing the man stretched there,
came up to him and asked him who he was and what was the matter with him
that he complained so dolefully.
</p>
<p>
Don Quixote was firmly persuaded that this was the Marquis of Mantua, his
uncle, so the only answer he made was to go on with his ballad, in which
he told the tale of his misfortune, and of the loves of the Emperor’s son
and his wife all exactly as the ballad sings it.
</p>
<p>
The peasant stood amazed at hearing such nonsense, and relieving him of
the visor, already battered to pieces by blows, he wiped his face, which
was covered with dust, and as soon as he had done so he recognised him and
said, “Señor Quixada” (for so he appears to have been called when he was
in his senses and had not yet changed from a quiet country gentleman into
a knight-errant), “who has brought your worship to this pass?” But to all
questions the other only went on with his ballad.
</p>
<p>
Seeing this, the good man removed as well as he could his breastplate and
backpiece to see if he had any wound, but he could perceive no blood nor
any mark whatever. He then contrived to raise him from the ground, and
with no little difficulty hoisted him upon his ass, which seemed to him to
be the easiest mount for him; and collecting the arms, even to the
splinters of the lance, he tied them on Rocinante, and leading him by the
bridle and the ass by the halter he took the road for the village, very
to sally forth with him and serve him as esquire. Don Quixote, among other
sad to hear what absurd stuff Don Quixote was talking.
</p>
<p>
<br><br><br><br> <a id="p029"></a>
</p>
<div class="fig" style="width:60%;">

<br><br><br>
</p>
<p>
Nor was Don Quixote less so, for what with blows and bruises he could not
sit upright on the ass, and from time to time he sent up sighs to heaven,
so that once more he drove the peasant to ask what ailed him. And it could
have been only the devil himself that put into his head tales to match his
own adventures, for now, forgetting Baldwin, he bethought himself of the
Moor Abindarraez, when the Alcaide of Antequera, Rodrigo de Narvaez, took
him prisoner and carried him away to his castle; so that when the peasant
again asked him how he was and what ailed him, he gave him for reply the
same words and phrases that the captive Abindarraez gave to Rodrigo de
Narvaez, just as he had read the story in the “Diana” of Jorge de
Montemayor where it is written, applying it to his own case so aptly that
the peasant went along cursing his fate that he had to listen to such a
lot of nonsense; from which, however, he came to the conclusion that his
neighbour was mad, and so made all haste to reach the village to escape
the wearisomeness of this harangue of Don Quixote’s; who, at the end of
it, said, “Señor Don Rodrigo de Narvaez, your worship must know that this
fair Xarifa I have mentioned is now the lovely Dulcinea del Toboso, for
whom I have done, am doing, and will do the most famous deeds of chivalry
that in this world have been seen, are to be seen, or ever shall be seen.”
</p>
<p>
To this the peasant answered, “Señor—sinner that I am!—cannot
your worship see that I am not Don Rodrigo de Narvaez nor the Marquis of
Mantua, but Pedro Alonso your neighbour, and that your worship is neither
Baldwin nor Abindarraez, but the worthy gentleman Señor Quixada?”
</p>
<p>
“I know who I am,” replied Don Quixote, “and I know that I may be not only
those I have named, but all the Twelve Peers of France and even all the
Nine Worthies, since my achievements surpass all that they have done all
together and each of them on his own account.”
</p>
<p>
With this talk and more of the same kind they reached the village just as
night was beginning to fall, but the peasant waited until it was a little
later that the belaboured gentleman might not be seen riding in such a
miserable trim. When it was what seemed to him the proper time he entered
the village and went to Don Quixote’s house, which he found all in
confusion, and there were the curate and the village barber, who were
great friends of Don Quixote, and his housekeeper was saying to them in a
loud voice, “What does your worship think can have befallen my master,
Señor Licentiate Pero Perez?” for so the curate was called; “it is three
days now since anything has been seen of him, or the hack, or the buckler,
lance, or armour. Miserable me! I am certain of it, and it is as true as
that I was born to die, that these accursed books of chivalry he has, and
has got into the way of reading so constantly, have upset his reason; for
now I remember having often heard him saying to himself that he would turn
knight-errant and go all over the world in quest of adventures. To the
devil and Barabbas with such books, that have brought to ruin in this way
the finest understanding there was in all La Mancha!”
</p>
<p>
The niece said the same, and, more: “You must know, Master Nicholas”—for
made at him, and seizing his lance addressed him in bad Castilian and
that was the name of the barber—“it was often my uncle’s way to stay
two days and nights together poring over these unholy books of
misventures, after which he would fling the book away and snatch up his
sword and fall to slashing the walls; and when he was tired out he would
say he had killed four giants like four towers; and the sweat that flowed
from him when he was weary he said was the blood of the wounds he had
received in battle; and then he would drink a great jug of cold water and
become calm and quiet, saying that this water was a most precious potion
which the sage Esquife, a great magician and friend of his, had brought
him. But I take all the blame upon myself for never having told your
worships of my uncle’s vagaries, that you might put a stop to them before
things had come to this pass, and burn all these accursed books—for
he has a great number—that richly deserve to be burned like
heretics.”
</p>
<p>
“So say I too,” said the curate, “and by my faith to-morrow shall not pass
without public judgment upon them, and may they be condemned to the flames
lest they lead those that read to behave as my good friend seems to have
behaved.”
</p>
<p>
All this the peasant heard, and from it he understood at last what was the
matter with his neighbour, so he began calling aloud, “Open, your
worships, to Señor Baldwin and to Señor the Marquis of Mantua, who comes
badly wounded, and to Señor Abindarraez, the Moor, whom the valiant
Rodrigo de Narvaez, the Alcaide of Antequera, brings captive.”
</p>
<p>
At these words they all hurried out, and when they recognised their
friend, master, and uncle, who had not yet dismounted from the ass because
he could not, they ran to embrace him.
</p>
<p>
“Hold!” said he, “for I am badly wounded through my horse’s fault; carry
me to bed, and if possible send for the wise Urganda to cure and see to my
wounds.”
</p>
<p>
“See there! plague on it!” cried the housekeeper at this: “did not my
heart tell the truth as to which foot my master went lame of? To bed with
your worship at once, and we will contrive to cure you here without
fetching that Hurgada. A curse I say once more, and a hundred times more,
on those books of chivalry that have brought your worship to such a pass.”
</p>
<p>
They carried him to bed at once, and after searching for his wounds could
find none, but he said they were all bruises from having had a severe fall
with his horse Rocinante when in combat with ten giants, the biggest and
the boldest to be found on earth.
</p>
<p>
“So, so!” said the curate, “are there giants in the dance? By the sign of
the Cross I will burn them to-morrow before the day is over.”
</p>
<p>
They put a host of questions to Don Quixote, but his only answer to all
was—give him something to eat, and leave him to sleep, for that was
what he needed most. They did so, and the curate questioned the peasant at
great length as to how he had found Don Quixote. He told him, and the
nonsense he had talked when found and on the way home, all which made the
licentiate the more eager to do what he did the next day, which was to
summon his friend the barber, Master Nicholas, and go with him to Don
Quixote’s house.

OF THE DIVERTING AND IMPORTANT SCRUTINY WHICH THE CURATE AND THE BARBER

<p>
He was still sleeping; so the curate asked the niece for the keys of the
room where the books, the authors of all the mischief, were, and right
willingly she gave them. They all went in, the housekeeper with them, and
found more than a hundred volumes of big books very well bound, and some
other small ones. The moment the housekeeper saw them she turned about and
ran out of the room, and came back immediately with a saucer of holy water
and a sprinkler, saying, “Here, your worship, señor licentiate, sprinkle
this room; don’t leave any magician of the many there are in these books
to bewitch us in revenge for our design of banishing them from the world.”
</p>
<p>
The simplicity of the housekeeper made the licentiate laugh, and he
directed the barber to give him the books one by one to see what they were
about, as there might be some to be found among them that did not deserve
the penalty of fire.
</p>
<p>
“No,” said the niece, “there is no reason for showing mercy to any of
them; they have every one of them done mischief; better fling them out of
the window into the court and make a pile of them and set fire to them; or
else carry them into the yard, and there a bonfire can be made without the
smoke giving any annoyance.” The housekeeper said the same, so eager were
they both for the slaughter of those innocents, but the curate would not
agree to it without first reading at any rate the titles.
</p>
<p>
The first that Master Nicholas put into his hand was “The four books of
Amadis of Gaul.” “This seems a mysterious thing,” said the curate, “for,
as I have heard say, this was the first book of chivalry printed in Spain,
and from this all the others derive their birth and origin; so it seems to
me that we ought inexorably to condemn it to the flames as the founder of
so vile a sect.”
</p>
<p>
“Nay, sir,” said the barber, “I too, have heard say that this is the best
of all the books of this kind that have been written, and so, as something
singular in its line, it ought to be pardoned.”
</p>
<p>
“True,” said the curate; “and for that reason let its life be spared for
the present. Let us see that other which is next to it.”
</p>
<p>
“It is,” said the barber, “the ‘Sergas de Esplandian,’ the lawful son of
Amadis of Gaul.”
</p>
<p>
“Then verily,” said the curate, “the merit of the father must not be put
down to the account of the son. Take it, mistress housekeeper; open the
window and fling it into the yard and lay the foundation of the pile for
the bonfire we are to make.”
</p>
<p>
The housekeeper obeyed with great satisfaction, and the worthy
“Esplandian” went flying into the yard to await with all patience the fire
that was in store for him.
</p>
<p>
“Proceed,” said the curate.
</p>
<p>
“This that comes next,” said the barber, “is ‘Amadis of Greece,’ and,
indeed, I believe all those on this side are of the same Amadis lineage.”
</p>
<p>
“Then to the yard with the whole of them,” said the curate; “for to have
the burning of Queen Pintiquiniestra, and the shepherd Darinel and his
eclogues, and the bedevilled and involved discourses of his author, I
would burn with them the father who begot me if he were going about in the
guise of a knight-errant.”
</p>
<p>
“I am of the same mind,” said the barber.
</p>
<p>
“And so am I,” added the niece.
</p>
<p>
“In that case,” said the housekeeper, “here, into the yard with them!”
</p>
<p>
They were handed to her, and as there were many of them, she spared
herself the staircase, and flung them down out of the window.
</p>
<p>
“Who is that tub there?” said the curate.
</p>
<p>
“This,” said the barber, “is ‘Don Olivante de Laura.’”
</p>
<p>
“The author of that book,” said the curate, “was the same that wrote ‘The
Garden of Flowers,’ and truly there is no deciding which of the two books
is the more truthful, or, to put it better, the less lying; all I can say
is, send this one into the yard for a swaggering fool.”
</p>
<p>
“This that follows is ‘Florismarte of Hircania,’” said the barber.
</p>
<p>
“Señor Florismarte here?” said the curate; “then by my faith he must take
up his quarters in the yard, in spite of his marvellous birth and
visionary adventures, for the stiffness and dryness of his style deserve
nothing else; into the yard with him and the other, mistress housekeeper.”
</p>
<p>
“With all my heart, señor,” said she, and executed the order with great
delight.
</p>
<p>
“This,” said the barber, “is ‘The Knight Platir.’”
</p>
<p>
“An old book that,” said the curate, “but I find no reason for clemency in
it; send it after the others without appeal;” which was done.
</p>
<p>
Another book was opened, and they saw it was entitled, “The Knight of the
Cross.”
</p>
<p>
“For the sake of the holy name this book has,” said the curate, “its
ignorance might be excused; but then, they say, ‘behind the cross there’s
the devil;’ to the fire with it.”
</p>
<p>
Taking down another book, the barber said, “This is ‘The Mirror of
Chivalry.’”
</p>
<p>
“I know his worship,” said the curate; “that is where Señor Reinaldos of
Montalvan figures with his friends and comrades, greater thieves than
Cacus, and the Twelve Peers of France with the veracious historian Turpin;
however, I am not for condemning them to more than perpetual banishment,
because, at any rate, they have some share in the invention of the famous
Matteo Boiardo, whence too the Christian poet Ludovico Ariosto wove his
web, to whom, if I find him here, and speaking any language but his own, I
shall show no respect whatever; but if he speaks his own tongue I will put
him upon my head.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, I have him in Italian,” said the barber, “but I do not understand
him.”
</p>
<p>
“Nor would it be well that you should understand him,” said the curate,
“and on that score we might have excused the Captain if he had not brought
him into Spain and turned him into Castilian. He robbed him of a great
deal of his natural force, and so do all those who try to turn books
written in verse into another language, for, with all the pains they take
and all the cleverness they show, they never can reach the level of the
originals as they were first produced. In short, I say that this book, and
all that may be found treating of those French affairs, should be thrown
into or deposited in some dry well, until after more consideration it is
settled what is to be done with them; excepting always one ‘Bernardo del
Carpio’ that is going about, and another called ‘Roncesvalles;’ for these,
if they come into my hands, shall pass at once into those of the
housekeeper, and from hers into the fire without any reprieve.”
</p>
<p>
To all this the barber gave his assent, and looked upon it as right and
proper, being persuaded that the curate was so staunch to the Faith and
loyal to the Truth that he would not for the world say anything opposed to
them. Opening another book he saw it was “Palmerin de Oliva,” and beside
it was another called “Palmerin of England,” seeing which the licentiate
said, “Let the Olive be made firewood of at once and burned until no ashes
even are left; and let that Palm of England be kept and preserved as a
thing that stands alone, and let such another case be made for it as that
which Alexander found among the spoils of Darius and set aside for the
safe keeping of the works of the poet Homer. This book, gossip, is of
authority for two reasons, first because it is very good, and secondly
because it is said to have been written by a wise and witty king of
Portugal. All the adventures at the Castle of Miraguarda are excellent and
of admirable contrivance, and the language is polished and clear, studying
and observing the style befitting the speaker with propriety and judgment.
So then, provided it seems good to you, Master Nicholas, I say let this
and ‘Amadis of Gaul’ be remitted the penalty of fire, and as for all the
rest, let them perish without further question or query.”
</p>
<p>
“Nay, gossip,” said the barber, “for this that I have here is the famous
‘Don Belianis.’”
</p>
<p>
“Well,” said the curate, “that and the second, third, and fourth parts all
stand in need of a little rhubarb to purge their excess of bile, and they
must be cleared of all that stuff about the Castle of Fame and other
greater affectations, to which end let them be allowed the over-seas term,
and, according as they mend, so shall mercy or justice be meted out to
them; and in the mean time, gossip, do you keep them in your house and let
no one read them.”
</p>
<p>
“With all my heart,” said the barber; and not caring to tire himself with
reading more books of chivalry, he told the housekeeper to take all the
big ones and throw them into the yard. It was not said to one dull or
deaf, but to one who enjoyed burning them more than weaving the broadest
and finest web that could be; and seizing about eight at a time, she flung
them out of the window.
</p>
<p>
In carrying so many together she let one fall at the feet of the barber,
who took it up, curious to know whose it was, and found it said, “History
of the Famous Knight, Tirante el Blanco.”
</p>
<p>
“God bless me!” said the curate with a shout, “‘Tirante el Blanco’ here!
Hand it over, gossip, for in it I reckon I have found a treasury of
enjoyment and a mine of recreation. Here is Don Kyrieleison of Montalvan,
a valiant knight, and his brother Thomas of Montalvan, and the knight
Fonseca, with the battle the bold Tirante fought with the mastiff, and the
witticisms of the damsel Placerdemivida, and the loves and wiles of the
widow Reposada, and the empress in love with the squire Hipolito—in
truth, gossip, by right of its style it is the best book in the world.
Here knights eat and sleep, and die in their beds, and make their wills
before dying, and a great deal more of which there is nothing in all the
other books. Nevertheless, I say he who wrote it, for deliberately
composing such fooleries, deserves to be sent to the galleys for life.
Take it home with you and read it, and you will see that what I have said
is true.”
</p>
<p>
“As you will,” said the barber; “but what are we to do with these little
books that are left?”
</p>
<p>
“These must be, not chivalry, but poetry,” said the curate; and opening
one he saw it was the “Diana” of Jorge de Montemayor, and, supposing all
the others to be of the same sort, “these,” he said, “do not deserve to be
burned like the others, for they neither do nor can do the mischief the
books of chivalry have done, being books of entertainment that can hurt no
one.”
</p>
<p>
“Ah, señor!” said the niece, “your worship had better order these to be
burned as well as the others; for it would be no wonder if, after being
cured of his chivalry disorder, my uncle, by reading these, took a fancy
to turn shepherd and range the woods and fields singing and piping; or,
what would be still worse, to turn poet, which they say is an incurable
and infectious malady.”
</p>
<p>
“The damsel is right,” said the curate, “and it will be well to put this
stumbling-block and temptation out of our friend’s way. To begin, then,
with the ‘Diana’ of Montemayor. I am of opinion it should not be burned,
but that it should be cleared of all that about the sage Felicia and the
magic water, and of almost all the longer pieces of verse: let it keep,
and welcome, its prose and the honour of being the first of books of the
kind.”
</p>
<p>
“This that comes next,” said the barber, “is the ‘Diana,’ entitled the
‘Second Part, by the Salamancan,’ and this other has the same title, and
its author is Gil Polo.”
</p>
<p>
“As for that of the Salamancan,” replied the curate, “let it go to swell
the number of the condemned in the yard, and let Gil Polo’s be preserved
as if it came from Apollo himself: but get on, gossip, and make haste, for
it is growing late.”
</p>
<p>
“This book,” said the barber, opening another, “is the ten books of the
‘Fortune of Love,’ written by Antonio de Lofraso, a Sardinian poet.”
</p>
<p>
“By the orders I have received,” said the curate, “since Apollo has been
Apollo, and the Muses have been Muses, and poets have been poets, so droll
and absurd a book as this has never been written, and in its way it is the
best and the most singular of all of this species that have as yet
appeared, and he who has not read it may be sure he has never read what is
delightful. Give it here, gossip, for I make more account of having found
it than if they had given me a cassock of Florence stuff.”
</p>
<p>
He put it aside with extreme satisfaction, and the barber went on, “These
that come next are ‘The Shepherd of Iberia,’ ‘Nymphs of Henares,’ and ‘The
Enlightenment of Jealousy.’”
</p>
<p>
“Then all we have to do,” said the curate, “is to hand them over to the
secular arm of the housekeeper, and ask me not why, or we shall never have
done.”
</p>
<p>
“This next is the ‘Pastor de Fílida.’”
</p>
<p>
“No Pastor that,” said the curate, “but a highly polished courtier; let it
be preserved as a precious jewel.”
</p>
<p>
“This large one here,” said the barber, “is called ‘The Treasury of
various Poems.’”
</p>
<p>
“If there were not so many of them,” said the curate, “they would be more
relished: this book must be weeded and cleansed of certain vulgarities
which it has with its excellences; let it be preserved because the author
is a friend of mine, and out of respect for other more heroic and loftier
works that he has written.”
</p>
<p>
“This,” continued the barber, “is the ‘Cancionero’ of Lopez de Maldonado.”
</p>
<p>
“The author of that book, too,” said the curate, “is a great friend of
mine, and his verses from his own mouth are the admiration of all who hear
them, for such is the sweetness of his voice that he enchants when he
chants them: it gives rather too much of its eclogues, but what is good
was never yet plentiful: let it be kept with those that have been set
apart. But what book is that next it?”
</p>
<p>
“The ‘Galatea’ of Miguel de Cervantes,” said the barber.
</p>
<p>
“That Cervantes has been for many years a great friend of mine, and to my
knowledge he has had more experience in reverses than in verses. His book
has some good invention in it, it presents us with something but brings
nothing to a conclusion: we must wait for the Second Part it promises:
perhaps with amendment it may succeed in winning the full measure of grace
that is now denied it; and in the mean time do you, señor gossip, keep it
shut up in your own quarters.”
</p>
<p>
“Very good,” said the barber; “and here come three together, the
‘Araucana’ of Don Alonso de Ercilla, the ‘Austriada’ of Juan Rufo, Justice
of Cordova, and the ‘Montserrate’ of Christobal de Virués, the Valencian
poet.”
</p>
<p>
“These three books,” said the curate, “are the best that have been written
in Castilian in heroic verse, and they may compare with the most famous of
Italy; let them be preserved as the richest treasures of poetry that Spain
possesses.”
</p>
<p>
The curate was tired and would not look into any more books, and so he
decided that, “contents uncertified,” all the rest should be burned; but
just then the barber held open one, called “The Tears of Angelica.”
</p>
<p>
“I should have shed tears myself,” said the curate when he heard the
title, “had I ordered that book to be burned, for its author was one of
the famous poets of the world, not to say of Spain, and was very happy in
the translation of some of Ovid’s fables.”

OF THE SECOND SALLY OF OUR WORTHY KNIGHT DON QUIXOTE OF LA MANCHA

<br><br><br>
</p>
<p>
At this instant Don Quixote began shouting out, “Here, here, valiant
knights! here is need for you to put forth the might of your strong arms,
for they of the Court are gaining the mastery in the tourney!” Called away
by this noise and outcry, they proceeded no farther with the scrutiny of
the remaining books, and so it is thought that “The Carolea,” “The Lion of
Spain,” and “The Deeds of the Emperor,” written by Don Luis de Ávila, went
to the fire unseen and unheard; for no doubt they were among those that
remained, and perhaps if the curate had seen them they would not have
undergone so severe a sentence.
</p>
<p>
When they reached Don Quixote he was already out of bed, and was still
shouting and raving, and slashing and cutting all round, as wide awake as
if he had never slept.
</p>
<p>
They closed with him and by force got him back to bed, and when he had
become a little calm, addressing the curate, he said to him, “Of a truth,
Señor Archbishop Turpin, it is a great disgrace for us who call ourselves
the Twelve Peers, so carelessly to allow the knights of the Court to gain
the victory in this tourney, we the adventurers having carried off the
honour on the three former days.”
</p>
<p>
“Hush, gossip,” said the curate; “please God, the luck may turn, and what
is lost to-day may be won to-morrow; for the present let your worship have
a care of your health, for it seems to me that you are over-fatigued, if
not badly wounded.”
</p>
<p>
“Wounded no,” said Don Quixote, “but bruised and battered no doubt, for
that bastard Don Roland has cudgelled me with the trunk of an oak tree,
and all for envy, because he sees that I alone rival him in his
achievements. But I should not call myself Reinaldos of Montalvan did he
not pay me for it in spite of all his enchantments as soon as I rise from
this bed. For the present let them bring me something to eat, for that, I
feel, is what will be more to my purpose, and leave it to me to avenge
myself.”
</p>
<p>
They did as he wished; they gave him something to eat, and once more he
fell asleep, leaving them marvelling at his madness.
</p>
<p>
That night the housekeeper burned to ashes all the books that were in the
yard and in the whole house; and some must have been consumed that
deserved preservation in everlasting archives, but their fate and the
laziness of the examiner did not permit it, and so in them was verified
the proverb that the innocent suffer for the guilty.
</p>
<p>
One of the remedies which the curate and the barber immediately applied to
their friend’s disorder was to wall up and plaster the room where the
books were, so that when he got up he should not find them (possibly the
cause being removed the effect might cease), and they might say that a
magician had carried them off, room and all; and this was done with all
despatch. Two days later Don Quixote got up, and the first thing he did
was to go and look at his books, and not finding the room where he had
left it, he wandered from side to side looking for it. He came to the
place where the door used to be, and tried it with his hands, and turned
and twisted his eyes in every direction without saying a word; but after a
good while he asked his housekeeper whereabouts was the room that held his
books.
</p>
<p>
The housekeeper, who had been already well instructed in what she was to
answer, said, “What room or what nothing is it that your worship is
looking for? There are neither room nor books in this house now, for the
devil himself has carried all away.”
</p>
<p>
“It was not the devil,” said the niece, “but a magician who came on a
cloud one night after the day your worship left this, and dismounting from
a serpent that he rode he entered the room, and what he did there I know
not, but after a little while he made off, flying through the roof, and
left the house full of smoke; and when we went to see what he had done we
saw neither book nor room: but we remember very well, the housekeeper and
I, that on leaving, the old villain said in a loud voice that, for a
private grudge he owed the owner of the books and the room, he had done
mischief in that house that would be discovered by-and-by: he said too
that his name was the Sage Muñaton.”
</p>
<p>
“He must have said Friston,” said Don Quixote.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know whether he called himself Friston or Friton,” said the
housekeeper, “I only know that his name ended with ‘ton.’”
</p>
<p>
“So it does,” said Don Quixote, “and he is a sage magician, a great enemy
of mine, who has a spite against me because he knows by his arts and lore
that in process of time I am to engage in single combat with a knight whom
he befriends and that I am to conquer, and he will be unable to prevent
it; and for this reason he endeavours to do me all the ill turns that he
can; but I promise him it will be hard for him to oppose or avoid what is
decreed by Heaven.”
</p>
<p>
“Who doubts that?” said the niece; “but, uncle, who mixes you up in these
quarrels? Would it not be better to remain at peace in your own house
instead of roaming the world looking for better bread than ever came of
wheat, never reflecting that many go for wool and come back shorn?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, niece of mine,” replied Don Quixote, “how much astray art thou in thy
reckoning: ere they shear me I shall have plucked away and stripped off
the beards of all who dare to touch only the tip of a hair of mine.”
</p>
<p>
The two were unwilling to make any further answer, as they saw that his
anger was kindling.
</p>
<p>
happened, and that all would have to be repaid him sevenfold; but for all
In short, then, he remained at home fifteen days very quietly without
showing any signs of a desire to take up with his former delusions, and
during this time he held lively discussions with his two gossips, the
curate and the barber, on the point he maintained, that knights-errant
were what the world stood most in need of, and that in him was to be
accomplished the revival of knight-errantry. The curate sometimes
contradicted him, sometimes agreed with him, for if he had not observed
this precaution he would have been unable to bring him to reason.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile Don Quixote worked upon a farm labourer, a neighbour of his, an
honest man (if indeed that title can be given to him who is poor), but
with very little wit in his pate. In a word, he so talked him over, and
with such persuasions and promises, that the poor clown made up his mind
to sally forth with him and serve him as esquire. Don Quixote, among other
things, told him he ought to be ready to go with him gladly, because any
moment an adventure might occur that might win an island in the twinkling
of an eye and leave him governor of it. On these and the like promises
Sancho Panza (for so the labourer was called) left wife and children, and
engaged himself as esquire to his neighbour.

<br><br><br>
</p>
<p>
Don Quixote next set about getting some money; and selling one thing and
pawning another, and making a bad bargain in every case, he got together a
fair sum. He provided himself with a buckler, which he begged as a loan
from a friend, and, restoring his battered helmet as best he could, he
believed.”
warned his squire Sancho of the day and hour he meant to set out, that he
might provide himself with what he thought most needful. Above all, he
charged him to take alforjas with him. The other said he would, and that
he meant to take also a very good ass he had, as he was not much given to
going on foot. About the ass, Don Quixote hesitated a little, trying
whether he could call to mind any knight-errant taking with him an esquire
mounted on ass-back, but no instance occurred to his memory. For all that,
however, he determined to take him, intending to furnish him with a more
honourable mount when a chance of it presented itself, by appropriating
the horse of the first discourteous knight he encountered. Himself he
provided with shirts and such other things as he could, according to the
advice the host had given him; all which being done, without taking leave,
Sancho Panza of his wife and children, or Don Quixote of his housekeeper
and niece, they sallied forth unseen by anybody from the village one
night, and made such good way in the course of it that by daylight they
held themselves safe from discovery, even should search be made for them.
</p>
<p>
Sancho rode on his ass like a patriarch, with his alforjas and bota, and
longing to see himself soon governor of the island his master had promised
him. Don Quixote decided upon taking the same route and road he had taken
on his first journey, that over the Campo de Montiel, which he travelled
with less discomfort than on the last occasion, for, as it was early
morning and the rays of the sun fell on them obliquely, the heat did not
distress them.
</p>
<p>
And now said Sancho Panza to his master, “Your worship will take care,
Señor Knight-errant, not to forget about the island you have promised me,
for be it ever so big I’ll be equal to governing it.”
</p>
<p>
To which Don Quixote replied, “Thou must know, friend Sancho Panza, that
it was a practice very much in vogue with the knights-errant of old to
make their squires governors of the islands or kingdoms they won, and I am
determined that there shall be no failure on my part in so liberal a
custom; on the contrary, I mean to improve upon it, for they sometimes,
and perhaps most frequently, waited until their squires were old, and then
when they had had enough of service and hard days and worse nights, they
gave them some title or other, of count, or at the most marquis, of some
valley or province more or less; but if thou livest and I live, it may
well be that before six days are over, I may have won some kingdom that
has others dependent upon it, which will be just the thing to enable thee
to be crowned king of one of them. Nor needst thou count this wonderful,
for things and chances fall to the lot of such knights in ways so
unexampled and unexpected that I might easily give thee even more than I
promise thee.”
</p>
<p>
“In that case,” said Sancho Panza, “if I should become a king by one of
those miracles your worship speaks of, even Juana Gutierrez, my old woman,
would come to be queen and my children infantes.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, who doubts it?” said Don Quixote.
</p>
<p>
“I doubt it,” replied Sancho Panza, “because for my part I am persuaded
that though God should shower down kingdoms upon earth, not one of them
would fit the head of Mari Gutierrez. Let me tell you, señor, she is not
worth two maravedis for a queen; countess will fit her better, and that
only with God’s help.”
</p>
<p>
“Leave it to God, Sancho,” returned Don Quixote, “for he will give her
what suits her best; but do not undervalue thyself so much as to come to
be content with anything less than being governor of a province.”
</p>
<p>
“I will not, señor,” answered Sancho, “specially as I have a man of such
quality for a master in your worship, who will know how to give me all
that will be suitable for me and that I can bear.”

OF THE GOOD FORTUNE WHICH THE VALIANT DON QUIXOTE HAD IN THE TERRIBLE AND

<br><br><br>
</p>
<p>
At this point they came in sight of thirty or forty windmills that there are
on that plain, and as soon as Don Quixote saw them he said to his squire,
“Fortune is arranging matters for us better than we could have shaped our
desires ourselves, for look there, friend Sancho Panza, where thirty or
more monstrous giants present themselves, all of whom I mean to engage in
battle and slay, and with whose spoils we shall begin to make our
fortunes; for this is righteous warfare, and it is God’s good service to
sweep so evil a breed from off the face of the earth.”
</p>
<p>
“What giants?” said Sancho Panza.
</p>
<p>
“Those thou seest there,” answered his master, “with the long arms, and
some have them nearly two leagues long.”
</p>
<p>
“Look, your worship,” said Sancho; “what we see there are not giants but
windmills, and what seem to be their arms are the sails that turned by the
wind make the millstone go.”
</p>
<p>
“It is easy to see,” replied Don Quixote, “that thou art not used to this
business of adventures; those are giants; and if thou art afraid, away
with thee out of this and betake thyself to prayer while I engage them in
fierce and unequal combat.”
</p>
<p>
So saying, he gave the spur to his steed Rocinante, heedless of the cries
his squire Sancho sent after him, warning him that most certainly they
were windmills and not giants he was going to attack. He, however, was so
positive they were giants that he neither heard the cries of Sancho, nor
perceived, near as he was, what they were, but made at them shouting, “Fly
not, cowards and vile beings, for a single knight attacks you.”
</p>
<p>
A slight breeze at this moment sprang up, and the great sails began to
move, seeing which Don Quixote exclaimed, “Though ye flourish more arms
than the giant Briareus, ye have to reckon with me.”
</p>
<p>
So saying, and commending himself with all his heart to his lady Dulcinea,
imploring her to support him in such a peril, with lance in rest and
covered by his buckler, he charged at Rocinante’s fullest gallop and fell
upon the first mill that stood in front of him; but as he drove his
lance-point into the sail the wind whirled it round with such force that
it shivered the lance to pieces, sweeping with it horse and rider, who
went rolling over on the plain, in a sorry condition. Sancho hastened to
his assistance as fast as his ass could go, and when he came up found him
unable to move, with such a shock had Rocinante fallen with him.

<br><br><br>
</p>
<p>
“God bless me!” said Sancho, “did I not tell your worship to mind what you
were about, for they were only windmills? and no one could have made any
mistake about it but one who had something of the same kind in his head.”
</p>
<p>
“Hush, friend Sancho,” replied Don Quixote, “the fortunes of war more than
any other are liable to frequent fluctuations; and moreover I think, and
it is the truth, that that same sage Friston who carried off my study and
books, has turned these giants into mills in order to rob me of the glory
of vanquishing them, such is the enmity he bears me; but in the end his
wicked arts will avail but little against my good sword.”

<br><br><br>
</p>
<p>
“God order it as he may,” said Sancho Panza, and helping him to rise got
him up again on Rocinante, whose shoulder was half out; and then,
discussing the late adventure, they followed the road to Puerto Lapice,
for there, said Don Quixote, they could not fail to find adventures in
abundance and variety, as it was a great thoroughfare. For all that, he
was much grieved at the loss of his lance, and saying so to his squire, he
added, “I remember having read how a Spanish knight, Diego Perez de Vargas
by name, having broken his sword in battle, tore from an oak a ponderous
bough or branch, and with it did such things that day, and pounded so many
Moors, that he got the surname of Machuca, and he and his descendants from
that day forth were called Vargas y Machuca. I mention this because from
the first oak I see I mean to rend such another branch, large and stout
like that, with which I am determined and resolved to do such deeds that
thou mayest deem thyself very fortunate in being found worthy to come and
see them, and be an eyewitness of things that will with difficulty be
believed.”
</p>
<p>
“Be that as God will,” said Sancho, “I believe it all as your worship says
it; but straighten yourself a little, for you seem all on one side, may be
from the shaking of the fall.”
</p>
<p>
“That is the truth,” said Don Quixote, “and if I make no complaint of the
pain it is because knights-errant are not permitted to complain of any
wound, even though their bowels be coming out through it.”
</p>
<p>
“If so,” said Sancho, “I have nothing to say; but God knows I would rather
your worship complained when anything ailed you. For my part, I confess I
must complain however small the ache may be; unless this rule about not
complaining extends to the squires of knights-errant also.”
</p>
<p>
Don Quixote could not help laughing at his squire’s simplicity, and he
assured him he might complain whenever and however he chose, just as he
liked, for, so far, he had never read of anything to the contrary in the
order of knighthood.
</p>
<p>
Sancho bade him remember it was dinner-time, to which his master answered
that he wanted nothing himself just then, but that <i>he</i> might eat when he
had a mind. With this permission Sancho settled himself as comfortably as
he could on his beast, and taking out of the alforjas what he had stowed
away in them, he jogged along behind his master munching deliberately, and
from time to time taking a pull at the bota with a relish that the
thirstiest tapster in Malaga might have envied; and while he went on in
this way, gulping down draught after draught, he never gave a thought to
any of the promises his master had made him, nor did he rate it as
hardship but rather as recreation going in quest of adventures, however
dangerous they might be. Finally they passed the night among some trees,
from one of which Don Quixote plucked a dry branch to serve him after a
fashion as a lance, and fixed on it the head he had removed from the
broken one. All that night Don Quixote lay awake thinking of his lady
Dulcinea, in order to conform to what he had read in his books, how many a
night in the forests and deserts knights used to lie sleepless supported
by the memory of their mistresses. Not so did Sancho Panza spend it, for
having his stomach full of something stronger than chicory water he made
but one sleep of it, and, if his master had not called him, neither the
rays of the sun beating on his face nor all the cheery notes of the birds
welcoming the approach of day would have had power to waken him. On
getting up he tried the bota and found it somewhat less full than the
night before, which grieved his heart because they did not seem to be on
the way to remedy the deficiency readily. Don Quixote did not care to
break his fast, for, as has been already said, he confined himself to
savoury recollections for nourishment.
</p>
<p>
They returned to the road they had set out with, leading to Puerto Lapice,
and at three in the afternoon they came in sight of it. “Here, brother
Sancho Panza,” said Don Quixote when he saw it, “we may plunge our hands
up to the elbows in what they call adventures; but observe, even shouldst
thou see me in the greatest danger in the world, thou must not put a hand
to thy sword in my defence, unless indeed thou perceivest that those who
assail me are rabble or base folk; for in that case thou mayest very
properly aid me; but if they be knights it is on no account permitted or
allowed thee by the laws of knighthood to help me until thou hast been
dubbed a knight.”
</p>
<p>
“Most certainly, señor,” replied Sancho, “your worship shall be fully
obeyed in this matter; all the more as of myself I am peaceful and no
friend to mixing in strife and quarrels: it is true that as regards the
defence of my own person I shall not give much heed to those laws, for
laws human and divine allow each one to defend himself against any
assailant whatever.”
</p>
<p>
“That I grant,” said Don Quixote, “but in this matter of aiding me against
knights thou must put a restraint upon thy natural impetuosity.”
</p>
<p>
“I will do so, I promise you,” answered Sancho, “and will keep this
precept as carefully as Sunday.”
</p>
<p>
While they were thus talking there appeared on the road two friars of the
order of St. Benedict, mounted on two dromedaries, for not less tall were
the two mules they rode on. They wore travelling spectacles and carried
sunshades; and behind them came a coach attended by four or five persons
on horseback and two muleteers on foot. In the coach there was, as
afterwards appeared, a Biscay lady on her way to Seville, where her
husband was about to take passage for the Indies with an appointment of
high honour. The friars, though going the same road, were not in her
company; but the moment Don Quixote perceived them he said to his squire,
“Either I am mistaken, or this is going to be the most famous adventure
that has ever been seen, for those black bodies we see there must be, and
doubtless are, magicians who are carrying off some stolen princess in that
coach, and with all my might I must undo this wrong.”
</p>
<p>
“This will be worse than the windmills,” said Sancho. “Look, señor; those
are friars of St. Benedict, and the coach plainly belongs to some
travellers: I tell you to mind well what you are about and don’t let the
devil mislead you.”
</p>
<p>
“I have told thee already, Sancho,” replied Don Quixote, “that on the
subject of adventures thou knowest little. What I say is the truth, as
thou shalt see presently.”
</p>
<p>
So saying, he advanced and posted himself in the middle of the road along
which the friars were coming, and as soon as he thought they had come near
enough to hear what he said, he cried aloud, “Devilish and unnatural
beings, release instantly the highborn princesses whom you are carrying
off by force in this coach, else prepare to meet a speedy death as the
just punishment of your evil deeds.”
</p>
<p>
The friars drew rein and stood wondering at the appearance of Don Quixote
as well as at his words, to which they replied, “Señor Caballero, we are
not devilish or unnatural, but two brothers of St. Benedict following our
road, nor do we know whether or not there are any captive princesses
coming in this coach.”
</p>
<p>
“No soft words with me, for I know you, lying rabble,” said Don Quixote,
and without waiting for a reply he spurred Rocinante and with levelled
lance charged the first friar with such fury and determination, that, if
the friar had not flung himself off the mule, he would have brought him to
the ground against his will, and sore wounded, if not killed outright. The
second brother, seeing how his comrade was treated, drove his heels into
his castle of a mule and made off across the country faster than the wind.
</p>
<p>
Sancho Panza, when he saw the friar on the ground, dismounting briskly from his
ass, rushed towards him and began to strip off his gown. At that instant the
friars’ muleteers came up and asked what he was stripping him for. Sancho
answered them that this fell to him lawfully as spoil of the battle which his
lord Don Quixote had won. The muleteers, who had no idea of a joke and did not
understand all this about battles and spoils, seeing that Don Quixote was some
distance off talking to the travellers in the coach, fell upon Sancho, knocked
him down, and leaving hardly a hair in his beard, belaboured him with kicks and
left him stretched breathless and senseless on the ground; and without any more
delay helped the friar to mount, who, trembling, terrified, and pale, as soon
as he found himself in the saddle, spurred after his companion, who was
standing at a distance looking on, watching the result of the onslaught; then,
not caring to wait for the end of the affair just begun, they pursued their
journey making more crosses than if they had the devil after them.
</p>
<p>
Don Quixote was, as has been said, speaking to the lady in the coach:
“Your beauty, lady mine,” said he, “may now dispose of your
person as may be most in accordance with your pleasure, for the pride of your
ravishers lies prostrate on the ground through this strong arm of mine; and
lest you should be pining to know the name of your deliverer, know that I am
called Don Quixote of La Mancha, knight-errant and adventurer, and captive to
the peerless and beautiful lady Dulcinea del Toboso: and in return for the
service you have received of me I ask no more than that you should return to El
Toboso, and on my behalf present yourself before that lady and tell her what I
have done to set you free.”
</p>
<p>
One of the squires in attendance upon the coach, a Biscayan, was listening
to all Don Quixote was saying, and, perceiving that he would not allow the
coach to go on, but was saying it must return at once to El Toboso, he
made at him, and seizing his lance addressed him in bad Castilian and
worse Biscayan after his fashion, “Begone, caballero, and ill go with
thee; by the God that made me, unless thou quittest coach, slayest thee as
art here a Biscayan.”
</p>
<p>
Don Quixote understood him quite well, and answered him very quietly, “If
thou wert a knight, as thou art none, I should have already chastised thy
folly and rashness, miserable creature.” To which the Biscayan returned,
“I no gentleman!—I swear to God thou liest as I am Christian: if
thou droppest lance and drawest sword, soon shalt thou see thou art
carrying water to the cat: Biscayan on land, hidalgo at sea, hidalgo at
the devil, and look, if thou sayest otherwise thou liest.”
</p>
<p>
“‘“You will see presently,” said Agrajes,’”
replied Don Quixote; and throwing his lance on the ground he drew his sword,
braced his buckler on his arm, and attacked the Biscayan, bent upon taking his
life.
</p>
<p>
The Biscayan, when he saw him coming on, though he wished to dismount from
his mule, in which, being one of those sorry ones let out for hire, he had
no confidence, had no choice but to draw his sword; it was lucky for him,
however, that he was near the coach, from which he was able to snatch a
cushion that served him for a shield; and they went at one another as if
they had been two mortal enemies. The others strove to make peace between
them, but could not, for the Biscayan declared in his disjointed phrase
that if they did not let him finish his battle he would kill his mistress
and everyone that strove to prevent him. The lady in the coach, amazed and
terrified at what she saw, ordered the coachman to draw aside a little,
and set herself to watch this severe struggle, in the course of which the
Biscayan smote Don Quixote a mighty stroke on the shoulder over the top of
his buckler, which, given to one without armour, would have cleft him to
the waist. Don Quixote, feeling the weight of this prodigious blow, cried
aloud, saying, “O lady of my soul, Dulcinea, flower of beauty, come to the
aid of this your knight, who, in fulfilling his obligations to your
beauty, finds himself in this extreme peril.” To say this, to lift his
sword, to shelter himself well behind his buckler, and to assail the
Biscayan was the work of an instant, determined as he was to venture all
upon a single blow. The Biscayan, seeing him come on in this way, was
convinced of his courage by his spirited bearing, and resolved to follow
his example, so he waited for him keeping well under cover of his cushion,
being unable to execute any sort of manoeuvre with his mule, which, dead
tired and never meant for this kind of game, could not stir a step.
</p>
<p>
On, then, as aforesaid, came Don Quixote against the wary Biscayan, with
uplifted sword and a firm intention of splitting him in half, while on his
side the Biscayan waited for him sword in hand, and under the protection
of his cushion; and all present stood trembling, waiting in suspense the
result of blows such as threatened to fall, and the lady in the coach and
the rest of her following were making a thousand vows and offerings to all
the images and shrines of Spain, that God might deliver her squire and all
of them from this great peril in which they found themselves. But it
spoils all, that at this point and crisis the author of the history leaves
this battle impending, giving as excuse that he could find nothing more
written about these achievements of Don Quixote than what has been already
set forth. It is true the second author of this work was unwilling to
believe that a history so curious could have been allowed to fall under
the sentence of oblivion, or that the wits of La Mancha could have been so
undiscerning as not to preserve in their archives or registries some
documents referring to this famous knight; and this being his persuasion,
he did not despair of finding the conclusion of this pleasant history,
which, heaven favouring him, he did find in a way that shall be related in
the Second Part.

<p>
In the First Part of this history we left the valiant Biscayan and the
renowned Don Quixote with drawn swords uplifted, ready to deliver two such
furious slashing blows that if they had fallen full and fair they would at
least have split and cleft them asunder from top to toe and laid them open
like a pomegranate; and at this so critical point the delightful history
came to a stop and stood cut short without any intimation from the author
where what was missing was to be found.
</p>
<p>
This distressed me greatly, because the pleasure derived from having read
such a small portion turned to vexation at the thought of the poor chance
that presented itself of finding the large part that, so it seemed to me,
was missing of such an interesting tale. It appeared to me to be a thing
impossible and contrary to all precedent that so good a knight should have
been without some sage to undertake the task of writing his marvellous
achievements; a thing that was never wanting to any of those
knights-errant who, they say, went after adventures; for every one of them
had one or two sages as if made on purpose, who not only recorded their
deeds but described their most trifling thoughts and follies, however
secret they might be; and such a good knight could not have been so
unfortunate as not to have what Platir and others like him had in
abundance. And so I could not bring myself to believe that such a gallant
tale had been left maimed and mutilated, and I laid the blame on Time, the
devourer and destroyer of all things, that had either concealed or
consumed it.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, it struck me that, inasmuch as among his books there
had been found such modern ones as “The Enlightenment of Jealousy” and the
“Nymphs and Shepherds of Henares,” his story must likewise be modern, and
that though it might not be written, it might exist in the memory of the
people of his village and of those in the neighbourhood. This reflection
kept me perplexed and longing to know really and truly the whole life and
wondrous deeds of our famous Spaniard, Don Quixote of La Mancha, light and
mirror of Manchegan chivalry, and the first that in our age and in these
so evil days devoted himself to the labour and exercise of the arms of
knight-errantry, righting wrongs, succouring widows, and protecting
damsels of that sort that used to ride about, whip in hand, on their
palfreys, with all their virginity about them, from mountain to mountain
and valley to valley—for, if it were not for some ruffian, or boor
with a hood and hatchet, or monstrous giant, that forced them, there were
in days of yore damsels that at the end of eighty years, in all which time
they had never slept a day under a roof, went to their graves as much
maids as the mothers that bore them. I say, then, that in these and other
respects our gallant Don Quixote is worthy of everlasting and notable
praise, nor should it be withheld even from me for the labour and pains
spent in searching for the conclusion of this delightful history; though I
know well that if Heaven, chance and good fortune had not helped me, the
world would have remained deprived of an entertainment and pleasure that
for a couple of hours or so may well occupy him who shall read it
attentively. The discovery of it occurred in this way.
</p>
<p>
One day, as I was in the Alcana of Toledo, a boy came up to sell some
pamphlets and old papers to a silk mercer, and, as I am fond of reading
even the very scraps of paper in the streets, led by this natural bent of
mine I took up one of the pamphlets the boy had for sale, and saw that it
was in characters which I recognised as Arabic, and as I was unable to
read them though I could recognise them, I looked about to see if there
were any Spanish-speaking Morisco at hand to read them for me; nor was
there any great difficulty in finding such an interpreter, for even had I
sought one for an older and better language I should have found him. In
short, chance provided me with one, who when I told him what I wanted and
put the book into his hands, opened it in the middle and after reading a
little in it began to laugh. I asked him what he was laughing at, and he
replied that it was at something the book had written in the margin by way
of a note. I bade him tell it to me; and he still laughing said, “In the
margin, as I told you, this is written: ‘<i>This Dulcinea del Toboso so often
mentioned in this history, had, they say, the best hand of any woman in
all La Mancha for salting pigs</i>.’”
</p>
<p>
When I heard Dulcinea del Toboso named, I was struck with surprise and
amazement, for it occurred to me at once that these pamphlets contained
the history of Don Quixote. With this idea I pressed him to read the
beginning, and doing so, turning the Arabic offhand into Castilian, he
told me it meant, “<i>History of Don Quixote of La Mancha, written by Cid
Hamete Benengeli, an Arab historian</i>.” It required great caution to hide
the joy I felt when the title of the book reached my ears, and snatching
it from the silk mercer, I bought all the papers and pamphlets from the
boy for half a real; and if he had had his wits about him and had known
how eager I was for them, he might have safely calculated on making more
than six reals by the bargain. I withdrew at once with the Morisco into
the cloister of the cathedral, and begged him to turn all these pamphlets
that related to Don Quixote into the Castilian tongue, without omitting or
adding anything to them, offering him whatever payment he pleased. He was
satisfied with two arrobas of raisins and two bushels of wheat, and
promised to translate them faithfully and with all despatch; but to make
the matter easier, and not to let such a precious find out of my hands, I
took him to my house, where in little more than a month and a half he
translated the whole just as it is set down here.
</p>
<p>
In the first pamphlet the battle between Don Quixote and the Biscayan was
drawn to the very life, they planted in the same attitude as the history
describes, their swords raised, and the one protected by his buckler, the
other by his cushion, and the Biscayan’s mule so true to nature that it
could be seen to be a hired one a bowshot off. The Biscayan had an
inscription under his feet which said, “<i>Don Sancho de Azpeitia</i>,” which no
doubt must have been his name; and at the feet of Rocinante was another
that said, “<i>Don Quixote</i>.” Rocinante was marvellously portrayed, so long
and thin, so lank and lean, with so much backbone and so far gone in
consumption, that he showed plainly with what judgment and propriety the
name of Rocinante had been bestowed upon him. Near him was Sancho Panza
holding the halter of his ass, at whose feet was another label that said,
“Sancho Zancas,” and according to the picture, he must have had a big
belly, a short body, and long shanks, for which reason, no doubt, the
names of Panza and Zancas were given him, for by these two surnames the
history several times calls him. Some other trifling particulars might be
mentioned, but they are all of slight importance and have nothing to do
with the true relation of the history; and no history can be bad so long
as it is true.
</p>
<p>
If against the present one any objection be raised on the score of its
truth, it can only be that its author was an Arab, as lying is a very
common propensity with those of that nation; though, as they are such
enemies of ours, it is conceivable that there were omissions rather than
additions made in the course of it. And this is my own opinion; for, where
he could and should give freedom to his pen in praise of so worthy a
knight, he seems to me deliberately to pass it over in silence; which is
ill done and worse contrived, for it is the business and duty of
historians to be exact, truthful, and wholly free from passion, and
neither interest nor fear, hatred nor love, should make them swerve from
the path of truth, whose mother is history, rival of time, storehouse of
deeds, witness for the past, example and counsel for the present, and
warning for the future. In this I know will be found all that can be
desired in the pleasantest, and if it be wanting in any good quality, I
maintain it is the fault of its hound of an author and not the fault of
