here; if I had thought of him in the stable I would have spoken there.”
</p>
<p>
On which the duke observed, “Sancho is quite right, and there is no
reason at all to find fault with him; Dapple shall be fed to his heart’s
content, and Sancho may rest easy, for he shall be treated like himself.”
</p>
<p>
While this conversation, amusing to all except Don Quixote, was
proceeding, they ascended the staircase and ushered Don Quixote into a
chamber hung with rich cloth of gold and brocade; six damsels relieved him
of his armour and waited on him like pages, all of them prepared and
instructed by the duke and duchess as to what they were to do, and how
they were to treat Don Quixote, so that he might see and believe they were
treating him like a knight-errant. When his armour was removed, there
stood Don Quixote in his tight-fitting breeches and chamois doublet, lean,
lanky, and long, with cheeks that seemed to be kissing each other inside;
such a figure, that if the damsels waiting on him had not taken care to
check their merriment (which was one of the particular directions their
master and mistress had given them), they would have burst with laughter.
They asked him to let himself be stripped that they might put a shirt on
him, but he would not on any account, saying that modesty became
knights-errant just as much as valour. However, he said they might give
the shirt to Sancho; and shutting himself in with him in a room where
there was a sumptuous bed, he undressed and put on the shirt; and then,
finding himself alone with Sancho, he said to him, “Tell me, thou
new-fledged buffoon and old booby, dost thou think it right to offend and
insult a duenna so deserving of reverence and respect as that one just
now? Was that a time to bethink thee of thy Dapple, or are these noble
personages likely to let the beasts fare badly when they treat their
owners in such elegant style? For God’s sake, Sancho, restrain
thyself, and don’t show the thread so as to let them see what a
Moors when they rush to battle; trumpets and clarions brayed, drums beat,
coarse, boorish texture thou art of. Remember, sinner that thou art, the
master is the more esteemed the more respectable and well-bred his
servants are; and that one of the greatest advantages that princes have
over other men is that they have servants as good as themselves to wait on
them. Dost thou not see—shortsighted being that thou art, and
unlucky mortal that I am!—that if they perceive thee to be a coarse
clown or a dull blockhead, they will suspect me to be some impostor or
swindler? Nay, nay, Sancho friend, keep clear, oh, keep clear of these
stumbling-blocks; for he who falls into the way of being a chatterbox and
droll, drops into a wretched buffoon the first time he trips; bridle thy
tongue, consider and weigh thy words before they escape thy mouth, and
bear in mind we are now in quarters whence, by God’s help, and the
strength of my arm, we shall come forth mightily advanced in fame and
fortune.”
</p>
<p>
Sancho promised him with much earnestness to keep his mouth shut, and to
bite off his tongue before he uttered a word that was not altogether to
the purpose and well considered, and told him he might make his mind easy
on that point, for it should never be discovered through him what they
were.
</p>
<p>
Don Quixote dressed himself, put on his baldric with his sword, threw the
scarlet mantle over his shoulders, placed on his head a montera of green
satin that the damsels had given him, and thus arrayed passed out into the
large room, where he found the damsels drawn up in double file, the same
number on each side, all with the appliances for washing the hands, which
they presented to him with profuse obeisances and ceremonies. Then came
twelve pages, together with the seneschal, to lead him to dinner, as his
hosts were already waiting for him. They placed him in the midst of them,
and with much pomp and stateliness they conducted him into another room,
where there was a sumptuous table laid with but four covers. The duchess
and the duke came out to the door of the room to receive him, and with
them a grave ecclesiastic, one of those who rule noblemen’s houses;
one of those who, not being born magnates themselves, never know how to
teach those who are how to behave as such; one of those who would have the
greatness of great folk measured by their own narrowness of mind; one of
those who, when they try to introduce economy into the household they
rule, lead it into meanness. One of this sort, I say, must have been the
grave churchman who came out with the duke and duchess to receive Don
Quixote.
</p>
<p>
A vast number of polite speeches were exchanged, and at length, taking Don
Quixote between them, they proceeded to sit down to table. The duke
pressed Don Quixote to take the head of the table, and, though he refused,
the entreaties of the duke were so urgent that he had to accept it.
</p>
<p>
The ecclesiastic took his seat opposite to him, and the duke and duchess
those at the sides. All this time Sancho stood by, gaping with amazement
at the honour he saw shown to his master by these illustrious persons; and
observing all the ceremonious pressing that had passed between the duke
and Don Quixote to induce him to take his seat at the head of the table,
he said, “If your worship will give me leave I will tell you a story
of what happened in my village about this matter of seats.”
</p>
<p>
The moment Sancho said this Don Quixote trembled, making sure that he was
about to say something foolish. Sancho glanced at him, and guessing his
thoughts, said, “Don’t be afraid of my going astray, señor, or
saying anything that won’t be pat to the purpose; I haven’t
forgotten the advice your worship gave me just now about talking much or
little, well or ill.”
</p>
<p>
“I have no recollection of anything, Sancho,” said Don
Quixote; “say what thou wilt, only say it quickly.”
</p>
<p>
Where, in heaven’s name, have you discovered that there are or ever
“Well then,” said Sancho, “what I am going to say is so
true that my master Don Quixote, who is here present, will keep me from
lying.”
</p>
<p>
“Lie as much as thou wilt for all I care, Sancho,” said Don
Quixote, “for I am not going to stop thee, but consider what thou
art going to say.”
</p>
<p>
“I have so considered and reconsidered,” said Sancho, “that
the bell-ringer’s in a safe berth; as will be seen by what follows.”
</p>
<p>
“It would be well,” said Don Quixote, “if your
highnesses would order them to turn out this idiot, for he will talk a
heap of nonsense.”
</p>
<p>
“By the life of the duke, Sancho shall not be taken away from me for
a moment,” said the duchess; “I am very fond of him, for I
know he is very discreet.”
</p>
<p>
“Discreet be the days of your holiness,” said Sancho, “for
the good opinion you have of my wit, though there’s none in me; but
the story I want to tell is this. There was an invitation given by a
gentleman of my town, a very rich one, and one of quality, for he was one
of the Alamos of Medina del Campo, and married to Doña Mencia de Quiñones,
the daughter of Don Alonso de Marañon, Knight of the Order of Santiago,
that was drowned at the Herradura—him there was that quarrel about
years ago in our village, that my master Don Quixote was mixed up in, to
the best of my belief, that Tomasillo the scapegrace, the son of Balbastro
the smith, was wounded in.—Isn’t all this true, master mine?
As you live, say so, that these gentlefolk may not take me for some lying
chatterer.”
</p>
<p>
“So far,” said the ecclesiastic, “I take you to be more
a chatterer than a liar; but I don’t know what I shall take you for
by-and-by.”
</p>
<p>
“Thou citest so many witnesses and proofs, Sancho,” said Don
Quixote, “that I have no choice but to say thou must be telling the
truth; go on, and cut the story short, for thou art taking the way not to
make an end for two days to come.”
</p>
<p>
“He is not to cut it short,” said the duchess; “on the
contrary, for my gratification, he is to tell it as he knows it, though he
should not finish it these six days; and if he took so many they would be
to me the pleasantest I ever spent.”
</p>
<p>
“Well then, sirs, I say,” continued Sancho, “that this
same gentleman, whom I know as well as I do my own hands, for it’s
not a bowshot from my house to his, invited a poor but respectable
labourer—”
</p>
<p>
“Get on, brother,” said the churchman; “at the rate you
are going you will not stop with your story short of the next world.”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll stop less than half-way, please God,” said Sancho;
“and so I say this labourer, coming to the house of the gentleman I
spoke of that invited him—rest his soul, he is now dead; and more by
token he died the death of an angel, so they say; for I was not there, for
just at that time I had gone to reap at Tembleque—”
</p>
<p>
“As you live, my son,” said the churchman, “make haste
back from Tembleque, and finish your story without burying the gentleman,
unless you want to make more funerals.”
</p>
<p>
“Well then, it so happened,” said Sancho, “that as the
pair of them were going to sit down to table—and I think I can see
them now plainer than ever—”
</p>
at the honour he saw shown to his master by these illustrious persons; and
<p>
Great was the enjoyment the duke and duchess derived from the irritation
the worthy churchman showed at the long-winded, halting way Sancho had of
telling his story, while Don Quixote was chafing with rage and vexation.
</p>
<p>
“So, as I was saying,” continued Sancho, “as the pair of
them were going to sit down to table, as I said, the labourer insisted
upon the gentleman’s taking the head of the table, and the gentleman
insisted upon the labourer’s taking it, as his orders should be
obeyed in his house; but the labourer, who plumed himself on his
politeness and good breeding, would not on any account, until the
gentleman, out of patience, putting his hands on his shoulders, compelled
him by force to sit down, saying, ‘Sit down, you stupid lout, for
wherever I sit will be the head to you; and that’s the story, and,
troth, I think it hasn’t been brought in amiss here.”
</p>
<p>
Don Quixote turned all colours, which, on his sunburnt face, mottled it
till it looked like jasper. The duke and duchess suppressed their laughter
so as not altogether to mortify Don Quixote, for they saw through Sancho’s
impertinence; and to change the conversation, and keep Sancho from
uttering more absurdities, the duchess asked Don Quixote what news he had
of the lady Dulcinea, and if he had sent her any presents of giants or
miscreants lately, for he could not but have vanquished a good many.
</p>
<p>
To which Don Quixote replied, “Señora, my misfortunes, though they
had a beginning, will never have an end. I have vanquished giants and I
have sent her caitiffs and miscreants; but where are they to find her if
she is enchanted and turned into the most ill-favoured peasant wench that
can be imagined?”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know,” said Sancho Panza; “to me she
seems the fairest creature in the world; at any rate, in nimbleness and
jumping she won’t give in to a tumbler; by my faith, señora duchess,
she leaps from the ground on to the back of an ass like a cat.”
</p>
<p>
“Have you seen her enchanted, Sancho?” asked the duke.
</p>
<p>
“What, seen her!” said Sancho; “why, who the devil was
it but myself that first thought of the enchantment business? She is as
much enchanted as my father.”
</p>
<p>
The ecclesiastic, when he heard them talking of giants and caitiffs and
enchantments, began to suspect that this must be Don Quixote of La Mancha,
whose story the duke was always reading; and he had himself often reproved
him for it, telling him it was foolish to read such fooleries; and
becoming convinced that his suspicion was correct, addressing the duke, he
said very angrily to him, “Señor, your excellence will have to give
account to God for what this good man does. This Don Quixote, or Don
Simpleton, or whatever his name is, cannot, I imagine, be such a blockhead
as your excellence would have him, holding out encouragement to him to go
on with his vagaries and follies.” Then turning to address Don
Quixote he said, “And you, num-skull, who put it into your head that
you are a knight-errant, and vanquish giants and capture miscreants? Go
your ways in a good hour, and in a good hour be it said to you. Go home
and bring up your children if you have any, and attend to your business,
and give over going wandering about the world, gaping and making a
laughing-stock of yourself to all who know you and all who don’t.
Where, in heaven’s name, have you discovered that there are or ever
passing. In addition to all this commotion, there came a further
were knights-errant? Where are there giants in Spain or miscreants in La
Mancha, or enchanted Dulcineas, or all the rest of the silly things they
tell about you?”
</p>
<p>
Don Quixote listened attentively to the reverend gentleman’s words,
and as soon as he perceived he had done speaking, regardless of the
presence of the duke and duchess, he sprang to his feet with angry looks
and an agitated countenance, and said—But the reply deserves a
chapter to itself.

<p>
Don Quixote, then, having risen to his feet, trembling from head to foot
like a man dosed with mercury, said in a hurried, agitated voice, “The
place I am in, the presence in which I stand, and the respect I have and
always have had for the profession to which your worship belongs, hold and
bind the hands of my just indignation; and as well for these reasons as
because I know, as everyone knows, that a gownsman’s weapon is the
same as a woman’s, the tongue, I will with mine engage in equal
combat with your worship, from whom one might have expected good advice
instead of foul abuse. Pious, well-meant reproof requires a different
demeanour and arguments of another sort; at any rate, to have reproved me
in public, and so roughly, exceeds the bounds of proper reproof, for that
comes better with gentleness than with rudeness; and it is not seemly to
call the sinner roundly blockhead and booby, without knowing anything of
the sin that is reproved. Come, tell me, for which of the stupidities you
have observed in me do you condemn and abuse me, and bid me go home and
look after my house and wife and children, without knowing whether I have
any? Is nothing more needed than to get a footing, by hook or by crook, in
other people’s houses to rule over the masters (and that, perhaps,
after having been brought up in all the straitness of some seminary, and
without having ever seen more of the world than may lie within twenty or
thirty leagues round), to fit one to lay down the law rashly for chivalry,
and pass judgment on knights-errant? Is it, haply, an idle occupation, or
is the time ill-spent that is spent in roaming the world in quest, not of
its enjoyments, but of those arduous toils whereby the good mount upwards
to the abodes of everlasting life? If gentlemen, great lords, nobles, men
of high birth, were to rate me as a fool I should take it as an
irreparable insult; but I care not a farthing if clerks who have never
entered upon or trod the paths of chivalry should think me foolish. Knight
I am, and knight I will die, if such be the pleasure of the Most High.
Some take the broad road of overweening ambition; others that of mean and
servile flattery; others that of deceitful hypocrisy, and some that of
true religion; but I, led by my star, follow the narrow path of
knight-errantry, and in pursuit of that calling I despise wealth, but not
honour. I have redressed injuries, righted wrongs, punished insolences,
vanquished giants, and crushed monsters; I am in love, for no other reason
than that it is incumbent on knights-errant to be so; but though I am, I
am no carnal-minded lover, but one of the chaste, platonic sort. My
intentions are always directed to worthy ends, to do good to all and evil
to none; and if he who means this, does this, and makes this his practice
deserves to be called a fool, it is for your highnesses to say, O most
excellent duke and duchess.”
</p>
<p>
“Good, by God!” cried Sancho; “say no more in your own
defence, master mine, for there’s nothing more in the world to be
said, thought, or insisted on; and besides, when this gentleman denies, as
he has, that there are or ever have been any knights-errant in the world,
is it any wonder if he knows nothing of what he has been talking about?”
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps, brother,” said the ecclesiastic, “you are that
Sancho Panza that is mentioned, to whom your master has promised an
island?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, I am,” said Sancho, “and what’s more, I am
one who deserves it as much as anyone; I am one of the sort—‘Attach
thyself to the good, and thou wilt be one of them,’ and of those,
‘Not with whom thou art bred, but with whom thou art fed,’ and
of those, ‘Who leans against a good tree, a good shade covers him;’
I have leant upon a good master, and I have been for months going about
with him, and please God I shall be just such another; long life to him
and long life to me, for neither will he be in any want of empires to
rule, or I of islands to govern.”
</p>
<p>
“No, Sancho my friend, certainly not,” said the duke, “for
in the name of Señor Don Quixote I confer upon you the government of one
of no small importance that I have at my disposal.”
</p>
<p>
“Go down on thy knees, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “and
kiss the feet of his excellence for the favour he has bestowed upon thee.”
</p>
<p>
Sancho obeyed, and on seeing this the ecclesiastic stood up from table
completely out of temper, exclaiming, “By the gown I wear, I am
almost inclined to say that your excellence is as great a fool as these
sinners. No wonder they are mad, when people who are in their senses
sanction their madness! I leave your excellence with them, for so long as
they are in the house, I will remain in my own, and spare myself the
trouble of reproving what I cannot remedy;” and without uttering
another word, or eating another morsel, he went off, the entreaties of the
duke and duchess being entirely unavailing to stop him; not that the duke
said much to him, for he could not, because of the laughter his
uncalled-for anger provoked.
</p>
<p>
When he had done laughing, he said to Don Quixote, “You have replied
on your own behalf so stoutly, Sir Knight of the Lions, that there is no
occasion to seek further satisfaction for this, which, though it may look
like an offence, is not so at all, for, as women can give no offence, no
more can ecclesiastics, as you very well know.”
</p>
<p>
“That is true,” said Don Quixote, “and the reason is,
that he who is not liable to offence cannot give offence to anyone. Women,
children, and ecclesiastics, as they cannot defend themselves, though they
may receive offence cannot be insulted, because between the offence and
the insult there is, as your excellence very well knows, this difference:
the insult comes from one who is capable of offering it, and does so, and
maintains it; the offence may come from any quarter without carrying
insult. To take an example: a man is standing unsuspectingly in the street
and ten others come up armed and beat him; he draws his sword and quits
himself like a man, but the number of his antagonists makes it impossible
for him to effect his purpose and avenge himself; this man suffers an
offence but not an insult. Another example will make the same thing plain:
a man is standing with his back turned, another comes up and strikes him,
and after striking him takes to flight, without waiting an instant, and
the other pursues him but does not overtake him; he who received the blow
received an offence, but not an insult, because an insult must be
maintained. If he who struck him, though he did so sneakingly and
treacherously, had drawn his sword and stood and faced him, then he who
had been struck would have received offence and insult at the same time;
offence because he was struck treacherously, insult because he who struck
him maintained what he had done, standing his ground without taking to
flight. And so, according to the laws of the accursed duel, I may have
received offence, but not insult, for neither women nor children can
maintain it, nor can they wound, nor have they any way of standing their
ground, and it is just the same with those connected with religion; for
these three sorts of persons are without arms offensive or defensive, and
so, though naturally they are bound to defend themselves, they have no
right to offend anybody; and though I said just now I might have received
offence, I say now certainly not, for he who cannot receive an insult can
still less give one; for which reasons I ought not to feel, nor do I feel,
aggrieved at what that good man said to me; I only wish he had stayed a
little longer, that I might have shown him the mistake he makes in
supposing and maintaining that there are not and never have been any
knights-errant in the world; had Amadis or any of his countless
descendants heard him say as much, I am sure it would not have gone well
with his worship.”
</p>
<p>
“I will take my oath of that,” said Sancho; “they would
have given him a slash that would have slit him down from top to toe like
a pomegranate or a ripe melon; they were likely fellows to put up with
jokes of that sort! By my faith, I’m certain if Reinaldos of
Montalvan had heard the little man’s words he would have given him
such a spank on the mouth that he wouldn’t have spoken for the next
three years; ay, let him tackle them, and he’ll see how he’ll
get out of their hands!”
</p>
<p>
The duchess, as she listened to Sancho, was ready to die with laughter,
and in her own mind she set him down as droller and madder than his
master; and there were a good many just then who were of the same opinion.
</p>
<p>
Don Quixote finally grew calm, and dinner came to an end, and as the cloth
was removed four damsels came in, one of them with a silver basin, another
with a jug also of silver, a third with two fine white towels on her
shoulder, and the fourth with her arms bared to the elbows, and in her
white hands (for white they certainly were) a round ball of Naples soap.
The one with the basin approached, and with arch composure and impudence,
thrust it under Don Quixote’s chin, who, wondering at such a
ceremony, said never a word, supposing it to be the custom of that country
to wash beards instead of hands; he therefore stretched his out as far as
he could, and at the same instant the jug began to pour and the damsel
with the soap rubbed his beard briskly, raising snow-flakes, for the soap
lather was no less white, not only over the beard, but all over the face,
and over the eyes of the submissive knight, so that they were perforce
obliged to keep shut. The duke and duchess, who had not known anything
about this, waited to see what came of this strange washing. The barber
damsel, when she had him a hand’s breadth deep in lather, pretended
that there was no more water, and bade the one with the jug go and fetch
some, while Señor Don Quixote waited. She did so, and Don Quixote was left
the strangest and most ludicrous figure that could be imagined. All those
present, and there were a good many, were watching him, and as they saw
him there with half a yard of neck, and that uncommonly brown, his eyes
shut, and his beard full of soap, it was a great wonder, and only by great
discretion, that they were able to restrain their laughter. The damsels,
the concocters of the joke, kept their eyes down, not daring to look at
their master and mistress; and as for them, laughter and anger struggled
within them, and they knew not what to do, whether to punish the audacity
of the girls, or to reward them for the amusement they had received from
seeing Don Quixote in such a plight.
</p>
<p>
At length the damsel with the jug returned and they made an end of washing
Don Quixote, and the one who carried the towels very deliberately wiped
him and dried him; and all four together making him a profound obeisance
and curtsey, they were about to go, when the duke, lest Don Quixote should
see through the joke, called out to the one with the basin saying, “Come
and wash me, and take care that there is water enough.” The girl,
sharp-witted and prompt, came and placed the basin for the duke as she had
done for Don Quixote, and they soon had him well soaped and washed, and
having wiped him dry they made their obeisance and retired. It appeared
afterwards that the duke had sworn that if they had not washed him as they
had Don Quixote he would have punished them for their impudence, which
they adroitly atoned for by soaping him as well.
</p>
<p>
Sancho observed the ceremony of the washing very attentively, and said to
himself, “God bless me, if it were only the custom in this country
to wash squires’ beards too as well as knights’. For by God
and upon my soul I want it badly; and if they gave me a scrape of the
razor besides I’d take it as a still greater kindness.”
</p>
<p>
“What are you saying to yourself, Sancho?” asked the duchess.
</p>
<p>
“I was saying, señora,” he replied, “that in the courts
of other princes, when the cloth is taken away, I have always heard say
they give water for the hands, but not lye for the beard; and that shows
it is good to live long that you may see much; to be sure, they say too
that he who lives a long life must undergo much evil, though to undergo a
washing of that sort is pleasure rather than pain.”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t be uneasy, friend Sancho,” said the duchess;
Enchanters have persecuted me, enchanters persecute me still, and
“I will take care that my damsels wash you, and even put you in the
tub if necessary.”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll be content with the beard,” said Sancho, “at
any rate for the present; and as for the future, God has decreed what is
to be.”
</p>
<p>
“Attend to worthy Sancho’s request, seneschal,” said the
duchess, “and do exactly what he wishes.”
</p>
<p>
The seneschal replied that Señor Sancho should be obeyed in everything;
and with that he went away to dinner and took Sancho along with him, while
the duke and duchess and Don Quixote remained at table discussing a great
variety of things, but all bearing on the calling of arms and
knight-errantry.
</p>
<p>
The duchess begged Don Quixote, as he seemed to have a retentive memory,
to describe and portray to her the beauty and features of the lady
Dulcinea del Toboso, for, judging by what fame trumpeted abroad of her
beauty, she felt sure she must be the fairest creature in the world, nay,
in all La Mancha.
</p>
<p>
Don Quixote sighed on hearing the duchess’s request, and said,
“If I could pluck out my heart, and lay it on a plate on this table
here before your highness’s eyes, it would spare my tongue the pain
of telling what can hardly be thought of, for in it your excellence would
see her portrayed in full. But why should I attempt to depict and describe
in detail, and feature by feature, the beauty of the peerless Dulcinea,
the burden being one worthy of other shoulders than mine, an enterprise
wherein the pencils of Parrhasius, Timantes, and Apelles, and the graver
of Lysippus ought to be employed, to paint it in pictures and carve it in
marble and bronze, and Ciceronian and Demosthenian eloquence to sound its
praises?”
</p>
<p>
“What does Demosthenian mean, Señor Don Quixote?” said the
duchess; “it is a word I never heard in all my life.”
</p>
<p>
“Demosthenian eloquence,” said Don Quixote, “means the
eloquence of Demosthenes, as Ciceronian means that of Cicero, who were the
two most eloquent orators in the world.”
</p>
<p>
“True,” said the duke; “you must have lost your wits to
ask such a question. Nevertheless, Señor Don Quixote would greatly gratify
us if he would depict her to us; for never fear, even in an outline or
sketch she will be something to make the fairest envious.”
</p>
<p>
“I would do so certainly,” said Don Quixote, “had she
not been blurred to my mind’s eye by the misfortune that fell upon
her a short time since, one of such a nature that I am more ready to weep
over it than to describe it. For your highnesses must know that, going a
few days back to kiss her hands and receive her benediction, approbation,
and permission for this third sally, I found her altogether a different
being from the one I sought; I found her enchanted and changed from a
princess into a peasant, from fair to foul, from an angel into a devil,
from fragrant to pestiferous, from refined to clownish, from a dignified
lady into a jumping tomboy, and, in a word, from Dulcinea del Toboso into
a coarse Sayago wench.”
</p>
<p>
“God bless me!” said the duke aloud at this, “who can
have done the world such an injury? Who can have robbed it of the beauty
that gladdened it, of the grace and gaiety that charmed it, of the modesty
that shed a lustre upon it?”
</p>
<p>
“Who?” replied Don Quixote; “who could it be but some
malignant enchanter of the many that persecute me out of envy—that
accursed race born into the world to obscure and bring to naught the
achievements of the good, and glorify and exalt the deeds of the wicked?
Enchanters have persecuted me, enchanters persecute me still, and
enchanters will continue to persecute me until they have sunk me and my
lofty chivalry in the deep abyss of oblivion; and they injure and wound me
where they know I feel it most. For to deprive a knight-errant of his lady
is to deprive him of the eyes he sees with, of the sun that gives him
light, of the food whereby he lives. Many a time before have I said it,
and I say it now once more, a knight-errant without a lady is like a tree
without leaves, a building without a foundation, or a shadow without the
body that causes it.”
</p>
<p>
“There is no denying it,” said the duchess; “but still,
if we are to believe the history of Don Quixote that has come out here
lately with general applause, it is to be inferred from it, if I mistake
not, that you never saw the lady Dulcinea, and that the said lady is
nothing in the world but an imaginary lady, one that you yourself begot
and gave birth to in your brain, and adorned with whatever charms and
perfections you chose.”
</p>
<p>
“There is a good deal to be said on that point,” said Don
Quixote; “God knows whether there be any Dulcinea or not in the
world, or whether she is imaginary or not imaginary; these are things the
proof of which must not be pushed to extreme lengths. I have not begotten
nor given birth to my lady, though I behold her as she needs must be, a
lady who contains in herself all the qualities to make her famous
throughout the world, beautiful without blemish, dignified without
haughtiness, tender and yet modest, gracious from courtesy and courteous
from good breeding, and lastly, of exalted lineage, because beauty shines
forth and excels with a higher degree of perfection upon good blood than
in the fair of lowly birth.”
</p>
<p>
“That is true,” said the duke; “but Señor Don Quixote
will give me leave to say what I am constrained to say by the story of his
exploits that I have read, from which it is to be inferred that, granting
there is a Dulcinea in El Toboso, or out of it, and that she is in the
highest degree beautiful as you have described her to us, as regards the
loftiness of her lineage she is not on a par with the Orianas,
Alastrajareas, Madasimas, or others of that sort, with whom, as you well
know, the histories abound.”
</p>
<p>
“To that I may reply,” said Don Quixote, “that Dulcinea
is the daughter of her own works, and that virtues rectify blood, and that
lowly virtue is more to be regarded and esteemed than exalted vice.
Dulcinea, besides, has that within her that may raise her to be a crowned
and sceptred queen; for the merit of a fair and virtuous woman is capable
of performing greater miracles; and virtually, though not formally, she
has in herself higher fortunes.”
</p>
<p>
“I protest, Señor Don Quixote,” said the duchess, “that
in all you say, you go most cautiously and lead in hand, as the saying is;
henceforth I will believe myself, and I will take care that everyone in my
house believes, even my lord the duke if needs be, that there is a
Dulcinea in El Toboso, and that she is living to-day, and that she is
beautiful and nobly born and deserves to have such a knight as Señor Don
Quixote in her service, and that is the highest praise that it is in my
power to give her or that I can think of. But I cannot help entertaining a
doubt, and having a certain grudge against Sancho Panza; the doubt is
this, that the aforesaid history declares that the said Sancho Panza, when
he carried a letter on your worship’s behalf to the said lady
Dulcinea, found her sifting a sack of wheat; and more by token it says it
was red wheat; a thing which makes me doubt the loftiness of her lineage.”
</p>
<p>
To this Don Quixote made answer, “Señora, your highness must know
that everything or almost everything that happens me transcends the
ordinary limits of what happens to other knights-errant; whether it be
that it is directed by the inscrutable will of destiny, or by the malice
of some jealous enchanter. Now it is an established fact that all or most
famous knights-errant have some special gift, one that of being proof
against enchantment, another that of being made of such invulnerable flesh
that he cannot be wounded, as was the famous Roland, one of the twelve
peers of France, of whom it is related that he could not be wounded except
in the sole of his left foot, and that it must be with the point of a
stout pin and not with any other sort of weapon whatever; and so, when
Bernardo del Carpio slew him at Roncesvalles, finding that he could not
wound him with steel, he lifted him up from the ground in his arms and
strangled him, calling to mind seasonably the death which Hercules
inflicted on Antæus, the fierce giant that they say was the son of Terra.
I would infer from what I have mentioned that perhaps I may have some gift
of this kind, not that of being invulnerable, because experience has many
times proved to me that I am of tender flesh and not at all impenetrable;
nor that of being proof against enchantment, for I have already seen
myself thrust into a cage, in which all the world would not have been able
to confine me except by force of enchantments. But as I delivered myself
from that one, I am inclined to believe that there is no other that can
hurt me; and so, these enchanters, seeing that they cannot exert their
vile craft against my person, revenge themselves on what I love most, and
seek to rob me of life by maltreating that of Dulcinea in whom I live; and
therefore I am convinced that when my squire carried my message to her,
they changed her into a common peasant girl, engaged in such a mean
occupation as sifting wheat; I have already said, however, that that wheat
was not red wheat, nor wheat at all, but grains of orient pearl. And as a
proof of all this, I must tell your highnesses that, coming to El Toboso a
short time back, I was altogether unable to discover the palace of
Dulcinea; and that the next day, though Sancho, my squire, saw her in her
own proper shape, which is the fairest in the world, to me she appeared to
be a coarse, ill-favoured farm-wench, and by no means a well-spoken one,
she who is propriety itself. And so, as I am not and, so far as one can
judge, cannot be enchanted, she it is that is enchanted, that is smitten,
that is altered, changed, and transformed; in her have my enemies revenged
themselves upon me, and for her shall I live in ceaseless tears, until I
see her in her pristine state. I have mentioned this lest anybody should
mind what Sancho said about Dulcinea’s winnowing or sifting; for, as
they changed her to me, it is no wonder if they changed her to him.
Dulcinea is illustrious and well-born, and of one of the gentle families
of El Toboso, which are many, ancient, and good. Therein, most assuredly,
not small is the share of the peerless Dulcinea, through whom her town
will be famous and celebrated in ages to come, as Troy was through Helen,
and Spain through La Cava, though with a better title and tradition. For
another thing; I would have your graces understand that Sancho Panza is
one of the drollest squires that ever served knight-errant; sometimes
there is a simplicity about him so acute that it is an amusement to try
and make out whether he is simple or sharp; he has mischievous tricks that
stamp him rogue, and blundering ways that prove him a booby; he doubts
everything and believes everything; when I fancy he is on the point of
coming down headlong from sheer stupidity, he comes out with something
shrewd that sends him up to the skies. After all, I would not exchange him
for another squire, though I were given a city to boot, and therefore I am
in doubt whether it will be well to send him to the government your
highness has bestowed upon him; though I perceive in him a certain
aptitude for the work of governing, so that, with a little trimming of his
understanding, he would manage any government as easily as the king does
his taxes; and moreover, we know already ample experience that it does not
require much cleverness or much learning to be a governor, for there are a
hundred round about us that scarcely know how to read, and govern like
gerfalcons. The main point is that they should have good intentions and be
desirous of doing right in all things, for they will never be at a loss
for persons to advise and direct them in what they have to do, like those
knight-governors who, being no lawyers, pronounce sentences with the aid
of an assessor. My advice to him will be to take no bribe and surrender no
right, and I have some other little matters in reserve, that shall be
produced in due season for Sancho’s benefit and the advantage of the
island he is to govern.”
</p>
<p>
The duke, duchess, and Don Quixote had reached this point in their
conversation, when they heard voices and a great hubbub in the palace, and
Sancho burst abruptly into the room all glowing with anger, with a
straining-cloth by way of a bib, and followed by several servants, or,
more properly speaking, kitchen-boys and other underlings, one of whom
carried a small trough full of water, that from its colour and impurity
was plainly dishwater. The one with the trough pursued him and followed
him everywhere he went, endeavouring with the utmost persistence to thrust
it under his chin, while another kitchen-boy seemed anxious to wash his
beard.
</p>
<p>
“What is all this, brothers?” asked the duchess. “What
is it? What do you want to do to this good man? Do you forget he is a
governor-elect?”
</p>
<p>
To which the barber kitchen-boy replied, “The gentleman will not let
himself be washed as is customary, and as my lord and the señor his master
have been.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, I will,” said Sancho, in a great rage; “but I’d
like it to be with cleaner towels, clearer lye, and not such dirty hands;
for there’s not so much difference between me and my master that he
should be washed with angels’ water and I with devil’s lye.
The customs of countries and princes’ palaces are only good so long
as they give no annoyance; but the way of washing they have here is worse
than doing penance. I have a clean beard, and I don’t require to be
as if I had said she was ugly or old, though it ought to be more natural
refreshed in that fashion, and whoever comes to wash me or touch a hair of
my head, I mean to say my beard, with all due respect be it said, I’ll
give him a punch that will leave my fist sunk in his skull; for cirimonies
and soapings of this sort are more like jokes than the polite attentions
of one’s host.”
</p>
<p>
The duchess was ready to die with laughter when she saw Sancho’s
rage and heard his words; but it was no pleasure to Don Quixote to see him
in such a sorry trim, with the dingy towel about him, and the hangers-on
of the kitchen all round him; so making a low bow to the duke and duchess,
as if to ask their permission to speak, he addressed the rout in a
dignified tone: “Holloa, gentlemen! you let that youth alone, and go
back to where you came from, or anywhere else if you like; my squire is as
clean as any other person, and those troughs are as bad as narrow
thin-necked jars to him; take my advice and leave him alone, for neither
he nor I understand joking.”
</p>
<p>
Sancho took the word out of his mouth and went on, “Nay, let them
come and try their jokes on the country bumpkin, for it’s about as
likely I’ll stand them as that it’s now midnight! Let them
bring me a comb here, or what they please, and curry this beard of mine,
and if they get anything out of it that offends against cleanliness, let
them clip me to the skin.”
</p>
<p>
Upon this, the duchess, laughing all the while, said, “Sancho Panza
is right, and always will be in all he says; he is clean, and, as he says
himself, he does not require to be washed; and if our ways do not please
him, he is free to choose. Besides, you promoters of cleanliness have been
excessively careless and thoughtless, I don’t know if I ought not to
say audacious, to bring troughs and wooden utensils and kitchen
dishclouts, instead of basins and jugs of pure gold and towels of holland,
to such a person and such a beard; but, after all, you are ill-conditioned
and ill-bred, and spiteful as you are, you cannot help showing the grudge
you have against the squires of knights-errant.”
</p>
<p>
The impudent servitors, and even the seneschal who came with them, took
the duchess to be speaking in earnest, so they removed the straining-cloth
from Sancho’s neck, and with something like shame and confusion of
face went off all of them and left him; whereupon he, seeing himself safe
out of that extreme danger, as it seemed to him, ran and fell on his knees
before the duchess, saying, “From great ladies great favours may be
looked for; this which your grace has done me to-day cannot be requited
with less than wishing I was dubbed a knight-errant, to devote myself all
the days of my life to the service of so exalted a lady. I am a labouring
man, my name is Sancho Panza, I am married, I have children, and I am
serving as a squire; if in any one of these ways I can serve your
highness, I will not be longer in obeying than your grace in commanding.”
</p>
<p>
“It is easy to see, Sancho,” replied the duchess, “that
you have learned to be polite in the school of politeness itself; I mean
to say it is easy to see that you have been nursed in the bosom of Señor
Don Quixote, who is, of course, the cream of good breeding and flower of
ceremony—or cirimony, as you would say yourself. Fair be the
fortunes of such a master and such a servant, the one the cynosure of
knight-errantry, the other the star of squirely fidelity! Rise, Sancho, my
friend; I will repay your courtesy by taking care that my lord the duke
makes good to you the promised gift of the government as soon as possible.”
</p>
<p>
With this, the conversation came to an end, and Don Quixote retired to
take his midday sleep; but the duchess begged Sancho, unless he had a very
great desire to go to sleep, to come and spend the afternoon with her and
her damsels in a very cool chamber. Sancho replied that, though he
certainly had the habit of sleeping four or five hours in the heat of the
day in summer, to serve her excellence he would try with all his might not
to sleep even one that day, and that he would come in obedience to her
command, and with that he went off. The duke gave fresh orders with
respect to treating Don Quixote as a knight-errant, without departing even
in smallest particular from the style in which, as the stories tell us,
they used to treat the knights of old.

<p>
The history records that Sancho did not sleep that afternoon, but in order
to keep his word came, before he had well done dinner, to visit the
duchess, who, finding enjoyment in listening to him, made him sit down
beside her on a low seat, though Sancho, out of pure good breeding, wanted
not to sit down; the duchess, however, told him he was to sit down as
governor and talk as squire, as in both respects he was worthy of even the
chair of the Cid Ruy Diaz the Campeador. Sancho shrugged his shoulders,
obeyed, and sat down, and all the duchess’s damsels and duennas
gathered round him, waiting in profound silence to hear what he would say.
It was the duchess, however, who spoke first, saying:
</p>
<p>
“Now that we are alone, and that there is nobody here to overhear
us, I should be glad if the señor governor would relieve me of certain
doubts I have, rising out of the history of the great Don Quixote that is
now in print. One is: inasmuch as worthy Sancho never saw Dulcinea, I mean
the lady Dulcinea del Toboso, nor took Don Quixote’s letter to her,
for it was left in the memorandum book in the Sierra Morena, how did he
dare to invent the answer and all that about finding her sifting wheat,
the whole story being a deception and falsehood, and so much to the
prejudice of the peerless Dulcinea’s good name, a thing that is not
at all becoming the character and fidelity of a good squire?”
</p>
<p>
<br><br><br><br> <a id="p33b"></a>
</p>
<div class="fig" style="width:60%;">

</p>
<p>
At these words, Sancho, without uttering one in reply, got up from his
chair, and with noiseless steps, with his body bent and his finger on his
lips, went all round the room lifting up the hangings; and this done, he
came back to his seat and said, “Now, señora, that I have seen that
there is no one except the bystanders listening to us on the sly, I will
answer what you have asked me, and all you may ask me, without fear or
dread. And the first thing I have got to say is, that for my own part I
hold my master Don Quixote to be stark mad, though sometimes he says
things that, to my mind, and indeed everybody’s that listens to him,
are so wise, and run in such a straight furrow, that Satan himself could
not have said them better; but for all that, really, and beyond all
question, it’s my firm belief he is cracked. Well, then, as this is
clear to my mind, I can venture to make him believe things that have
neither head nor tail, like that affair of the answer to the letter, and
that other of six or eight days ago, which is not yet in history, that is
to say, the affair of the enchantment of my lady Dulcinea; for I made him
believe she is enchanted, though there’s no more truth in it than
over the hills of Úbeda.”
</p>
<p>
The duchess begged him to tell her about the enchantment or deception, so
Sancho told the whole story exactly as it had happened, and his hearers
were not a little amused by it; and then resuming, the duchess said,
“In consequence of what worthy Sancho has told me, a doubt starts up
in my mind, and there comes a kind of whisper to my ear that says, ‘If
Don Quixote be mad, crazy, and cracked, and Sancho Panza his squire knows
it, and, notwithstanding, serves and follows him, and goes trusting to his
empty promises, there can be no doubt he must be still madder and sillier
than his master; and that being so, it will be cast in your teeth, señora
duchess, if you give the said Sancho an island to govern; for how will he
who does not know how to govern himself know how to govern others?’”
</p>
<p>
“By God, señora,” said Sancho, “but that doubt comes
timely; but your grace may say it out, and speak plainly, or as you like;
for I know what you say is true, and if I were wise I should have left my
master long ago; but this was my fate, this was my bad luck; I can’t
help it, I must follow him; we’re from the same village, I’ve
eaten his bread, I’m fond of him, I’m grateful, he gave me his
ass-colts, and above all I’m faithful; so it’s quite
impossible for anything to separate us, except the pickaxe and shovel. And
if your highness does not like to give me the government you promised, God
made me without it, and maybe your not giving it to me will be all the
better for my conscience, for fool as I am I know the proverb ‘to
her hurt the ant got wings,’ and it may be that Sancho the squire
will get to heaven sooner than Sancho the governor. ‘They make as
good bread here as in France,’ and ‘by night all cats are
grey,’ and ‘a hard case enough his, who hasn’t broken
his fast at two in the afternoon,’ and ‘there’s no
stomach a hand’s breadth bigger than another,’ and the same
can be filled ‘with straw or hay,’ as the saying is, and
‘the little birds of the field have God for their purveyor and
caterer,’ and ‘four yards of Cuenca frieze keep one warmer
than four of Segovia broad-cloth,’ and ‘when we quit this
world and are put underground the prince travels by as narrow a path as
the journeyman,’ and ‘the Pope’s body does not take up
more feet of earth than the sacristan’s,’ for all that the one
is higher than the other; for when we go to our graves we all pack
ourselves up and make ourselves small, or rather they pack us up and make
us small in spite of us, and then—good night to us. And I say once
more, if your ladyship does not like to give me the island because I’m
a fool, like a wise man I will take care to give myself no trouble about
it; I have heard say that ‘behind the cross there’s the devil,’
and that ‘all that glitters is not gold,’ and that from among
the oxen, and the ploughs, and the yokes, Wamba the husbandman was taken
to be made King of Spain, and from among brocades, and pleasures, and
riches, Roderick was taken to be devoured by adders, if the verses of the
old ballads don’t lie.”
</p>
<p>
“To be sure they don’t lie!” exclaimed Doña Rodriguez,
the duenna, who was one of the listeners. “Why, there’s a
ballad that says they put King Rodrigo alive into a tomb full of toads,
and adders, and lizards, and that two days afterwards the king, in a
plaintive, feeble voice, cried out from within the tomb-
</p>
<p class="poem">
They gnaw me now, they gnaw me now,<br>
There where I most did sin.
</p>
<p class="noindent">
And according to that the gentleman has good reason to say he would rather
be a labouring man than a king, if vermin are to eat him.”
</p>
<p>
The duchess could not help laughing at the simplicity of her duenna, or
wondering at the language and proverbs of Sancho, to whom she said,
“Worthy Sancho knows very well that when once a knight has made a
promise he strives to keep it, though it should cost him his life. My lord
and husband the duke, though not one of the errant sort, is none the less
“Let me alone, your highness,” said Sancho. “I’m
a knight for that reason, and will keep his word about the promised
island, in spite of the envy and malice of the world. Let Sancho be of
good cheer; for when he least expects it he will find himself seated on
the throne of his island and seat of dignity, and will take possession of
his government that he may discard it for another of three-bordered
brocade. The charge I give him is to be careful how he governs his
vassals, bearing in mind that they are all loyal and well-born.”
</p>
<p>
“As to governing them well,” said Sancho, “there’s
no need of charging me to do that, for I’m kind-hearted by nature,
and full of compassion for the poor; there’s no stealing the loaf
from him who kneads and bakes;’ and by my faith it won’t do to
throw false dice with me; I am an old dog, and I know all about ‘tus,
tus;’ I can be wide-awake if need be, and I don’t let clouds
come before my eyes, for I know where the shoe pinches me; I say so,
because with me the good will have support and protection, and the bad
neither footing nor access. And it seems to me that, in governments, to
make a beginning is everything; and maybe, after having been governor a
fortnight, I’ll take kindly to the work and know more about it than
the field labour I have been brought up to.”
</p>
<p>
“You are right, Sancho,” said the duchess, “for no one
is born ready taught, and the bishops are made out of men and not out of
stones. But to return to the subject we were discussing just now, the
enchantment of the lady Dulcinea, I look upon it as certain, and something
more than evident, that Sancho’s idea of practising a deception upon
his master, making him believe that the peasant girl was Dulcinea and that
if he did not recognise her it must be because she was enchanted, was all
a device of one of the enchanters that persecute Don Quixote. For in truth
and earnest, I know from good authority that the coarse country wench who
jumped up on the ass was and is Dulcinea del Toboso, and that worthy
Sancho, though he fancies himself the deceiver, is the one that is
deceived; and that there is no more reason to doubt the truth of this,
than of anything else we never saw. Señor Sancho Panza must know that we
too have enchanters here that are well disposed to us, and tell us what
goes on in the world, plainly and distinctly, without subterfuge or
deception; and believe me, Sancho, that agile country lass was and is
Dulcinea del Toboso, who is as much enchanted as the mother that bore her;
and when we least expect it, we shall see her in her own proper form, and
then Sancho will be disabused of the error he is under at present.”
</p>
<p>
“All that’s very possible,” said Sancho Panza; “and
now I’m willing to believe what my master says about what he saw in
the cave of Montesinos, where he says he saw the lady Dulcinea del Toboso
in the very same dress and apparel that I said I had seen her in when I
enchanted her all to please myself. It must be all exactly the other way,
as your ladyship says; because it is impossible to suppose that out of my
poor wit such a cunning trick could be concocted in a moment, nor do I
think my master is so mad that by my weak and feeble persuasion he could
be made to believe a thing so out of all reason. But, señora, your
excellence must not therefore think me ill-disposed, for a dolt like me is
not bound to see into the thoughts and plots of those vile enchanters. I
invented all that to escape my master’s scolding, and not with any
intention of hurting him; and if it has turned out differently, there is a
God in heaven who judges our hearts.”
</p>
<p>
“That is true,” said the duchess; “but tell me, Sancho,
what is this you say about the cave of Montesinos, for I should like to
know.”
</p>
<p>
Sancho upon this related to her, word for word, what has been said already
touching that adventure, and having heard it the duchess said, “From
this occurrence it may be inferred that, as the great Don Quixote says he
saw there the same country wench Sancho saw on the way from El Toboso, it
is, no doubt, Dulcinea, and that there are some very active and
exceedingly busy enchanters about.”
</p>
<p>
“So I say,” said Sancho, “and if my lady Dulcinea is
enchanted, so much the worse for her, and I’m not going to pick a
quarrel with my master’s enemies, who seem to be many and spiteful.
The truth is that the one I saw was a country wench, and I set her down to
be a country wench; and if that was Dulcinea it must not be laid at my
door, nor should I be called to answer for it or take the consequences.
But they must go nagging at me at every step—‘Sancho said it,
Sancho did it, Sancho here, Sancho there,’ as if Sancho was nobody
at all, and not that same Sancho Panza that’s now going all over the
world in books, so Samson Carrasco told me, and he’s at any rate one
that’s a bachelor of Salamanca; and people of that sort can’t
lie, except when the whim seizes them or they have some very good reason
for it. So there’s no occasion for anybody to quarrel with me; and
then I have a good character, and, as I have heard my master say, ‘a
good name is better than great riches;’ let them only stick me into
this government and they’ll see wonders, for one who has been a good
squire will be a good governor.”
</p>
<p>
“All worthy Sancho’s observations,” said the duchess,
“are Catonian sentences, or at any rate out of the very heart of
Michael Verino himself, who <i>florentibus occidit annis</i>. In fact, to speak
in his own style, ‘under a bad cloak there’s often a good
drinker.’”
</p>
<p>
“Indeed, señora,” said Sancho, “I never yet drank out of
wickedness; from thirst I have very likely, for I have nothing of the
hypocrite in me; I drink when I’m inclined, or, if I’m not
inclined, when they offer it to me, so as not to look either strait-laced
or ill-bred; for when a friend drinks one’s health what heart can be
so hard as not to return it? But if I put on my shoes I don’t dirty
them; besides, squires to knights-errant mostly drink water, for they are
always wandering among woods, forests and meadows, mountains and crags,
without a drop of wine to be had if they gave their eyes for it.”
</p>
<p>
“So I believe,” said the duchess; “and now let Sancho go
and take his sleep, and we will talk by-and-by at greater length, and
settle how he may soon go and stick himself into the government, as he
says.”
</p>
<p>
Sancho once more kissed the duchess’s hand, and entreated her to let
good care be taken of his Dapple, for he was the light of his eyes.
</p>
<p>
“What is Dapple?” said the duchess.
</p>
<p>
“My ass,” said Sancho, “which, not to mention him by
that name, I’m accustomed to call Dapple; I begged this lady duenna
here to take care of him when I came into the castle, and she got as angry
as if I had said she was ugly or old, though it ought to be more natural
and proper for duennas to feed asses than to ornament chambers. God bless
me! what a spite a gentleman of my village had against these ladies!”
</p>
<p>
“He must have been some clown,” said Doña Rodriguez the
duenna; “for if he had been a gentleman and well-born he would have
exalted them higher than the horns of the moon.”
</p>
<p>
“That will do,” said the duchess; “no more of this;
hush, Doña Rodriguez, and let Señor Panza rest easy and leave the
treatment of Dapple in my charge, for as he is a treasure of Sancho’s,
I’ll put him on the apple of my eye.”
</p>
<p>
“It will be enough for him to be in the stable,” said Sancho,
“for neither he nor I are worthy to rest a moment in the apple of
your highness’s eye, and I’d as soon stab myself as consent to
it; for though my master says that in civilities it is better to lose by a
card too many than a card too few, when it comes to civilities to asses we
must mind what we are about and keep within due bounds.”
</p>
<p>
“Take him to your government, Sancho,” said the duchess,
“and there you will be able to make as much of him as you like, and
even release him from work and pension him off.”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t think, señora duchess, that you have said anything
absurd,” said Sancho; “I have seen more than two asses go to
governments, and for me to take mine with me would be nothing new.”
</p>
<p>
Sancho’s words made the duchess laugh again and gave her fresh
amusement, and dismissing him to sleep she went away to tell the duke the
conversation she had had with him, and between them they plotted and
arranged to play a joke upon Don Quixote that was to be a rare one and
entirely in knight-errantry style, and in that same style they practised
several upon him, so much in keeping and so clever that they form the best
adventures this great history contains.

</p>
<p>
Great was the pleasure the duke and duchess took in the conversation of
Don Quixote and Sancho Panza; and, more bent than ever upon the plan they
had of practising some jokes upon them that should have the look and
appearance of adventures, they took as their basis of action what Don
Quixote had already told them about the cave of Montesinos, in order to
play him a famous one. But what the duchess marvelled at above all was
that Sancho’s simplicity could be so great as to make him believe as
absolute truth that Dulcinea had been enchanted, when it was he himself
who had been the enchanter and trickster in the business. Having,
therefore, instructed their servants in everything they were to do, six
days afterwards they took him out to hunt, with as great a retinue of
huntsmen and beaters as a crowned king.
</p>
<p>
They presented Don Quixote with a hunting suit, and Sancho with another of
the finest green cloth; but Don Quixote declined to put his on, saying
that he must soon return to the hard pursuit of arms, and could not carry
wardrobes or stores with him. Sancho, however, took what they gave him,
meaning to sell it at the first opportunity.
</p>
<p>
The appointed day having arrived, Don Quixote armed himself, and Sancho
arrayed himself, and mounted on his Dapple (for he would not give him up
though they offered him a horse), he placed himself in the midst of the
troop of huntsmen. The duchess came out splendidly attired, and Don
Quixote, in pure courtesy and politeness, held the rein of her palfrey,
though the duke wanted not to allow him; and at last they reached a wood
that lay between two high mountains, where, after occupying various posts,
ambushes, and paths, and distributing the party in different positions,
the hunt began with great noise, shouting, and hallooing, so that, between
the baying of the hounds and the blowing of the horns, they could not hear
one another. The duchess dismounted, and with a sharp boar-spear in her
hand posted herself where she knew the wild boars were in the habit of
passing. The duke and Don Quixote likewise dismounted and placed
themselves one at each side of her. Sancho took up a position in the rear
of all without dismounting from Dapple, whom he dared not desert lest some
mischief should befall him. Scarcely had they taken their stand in a line
with several of their servants, when they saw a huge boar, closely pressed
by the hounds and followed by the huntsmen, making towards them, grinding
his teeth and tusks, and scattering foam from his mouth. As soon as he saw
him Don Quixote, bracing his shield on his arm, and drawing his sword,
advanced to meet him; the duke with boar-spear did the same; but the
duchess would have gone in front of them all had not the duke prevented
her. Sancho alone, deserting Dapple at the sight of the mighty beast, took
to his heels as hard as he could and strove in vain to mount a tall oak.
As he was clinging to a branch, however, half-way up in his struggle to
reach the top, the bough, such was his ill-luck and hard fate, gave way,
and caught in his fall by a broken limb of the oak, he hung suspended in
the air unable to reach the ground. Finding himself in this position, and
that the green coat was beginning to tear, and reflecting that if the
fierce animal came that way he might be able to get at him, he began to
utter such cries, and call for help so earnestly, that all who heard him
and did not see him felt sure he must be in the teeth of some wild beast.
In the end the tusked boar fell pierced by the blades of the many spears
they held in front of him; and Don Quixote, turning round at the cries of
Sancho, for he knew by them that it was he, saw him hanging from the oak
head downwards, with Dapple, who did not forsake him in his distress,
close beside him; and Cide Hamete observes that he seldom saw Sancho Panza
without seeing Dapple, or Dapple without seeing Sancho Panza; such was
their attachment and loyalty one to the other. Don Quixote went over and
unhooked Sancho, who, as soon as he found himself on the ground, looked at
the rent in his huntingcoat and was grieved to the heart, for he thought
he had got a patrimonial estate in that suit.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile they had slung the mighty boar across the back of a mule, and
having covered it with sprigs of rosemary and branches of myrtle, they
bore it away as the spoils of victory to some large field-tents which had
been pitched in the middle of the wood, where they found the tables laid
and dinner served, in such grand and sumptuous style that it was easy to
see the rank and magnificence of those who had provided it. Sancho, as he
showed the rents in his torn suit to the duchess, observed, “If we
had been hunting hares, or after small birds, my coat would have been safe
from being in the plight it’s in; I don’t know what pleasure
one can find in lying in wait for an animal that may take your life with
his tusk if he gets at you. I recollect having heard an old ballad sung
that says,
</p>
<p class="poem">
By bears be thou devoured, as erst<br>
Was famous Favila.”
</p>
<p>
“That,” said Don Quixote, “was a Gothic king, who, going
a-hunting, was devoured by a bear.”
</p>
<p>
“Just so,” said Sancho; “and I would not have kings and
knights-errant; and I give unceasing thanks to heaven that I am one, and
princes expose themselves to such dangers for the sake of a pleasure
which, to my mind, ought not to be one, as it consists in killing an
animal that has done no harm whatever.”
</p>
<p>
“Quite the contrary, Sancho; you are wrong there,” said the
duke; “for hunting is more suitable and requisite for kings and
princes than for anybody else. The chase is the emblem of war; it has
stratagems, wiles, and crafty devices for overcoming the enemy in safety;
in it extreme cold and intolerable heat have to be borne, indolence and
sleep are despised, the bodily powers are invigorated, the limbs of him
who engages in it are made supple, and, in a word, it is a pursuit which
may be followed without injury to anyone and with enjoyment to many; and
the best of it is, it is not for everybody, as field-sports of other sorts
are, except hawking, which also is only for kings and great lords.
Reconsider your opinion therefore, Sancho, and when you are governor take
to hunting, and you will find the good of it.”
</p>
<p>
“Nay,” said Sancho, “the good governor should have a
broken leg and keep at home;” it would be a nice thing if, after
people had been at the trouble of coming to look for him on business, the
governor were to be away in the forest enjoying himself; the government
would go on badly in that fashion. By my faith, señor, hunting and
amusements are more fit for idlers than for governors; what I intend to
amuse myself with is playing all fours at Eastertime, and bowls on Sundays
and holidays; for these huntings don’t suit my condition or agree
with my conscience.”
</p>
<p>
“God grant it may turn out so,” said the duke; “because
it’s a long step from saying to doing.”
</p>
<p>
“Be that as it may,” said Sancho, “‘pledges don’t
distress a good payer,’ and ‘he whom God helps does better
than he who gets up early,’ and ‘it’s the tripes that
carry the feet and not the feet the tripes;’ I mean to say that if
God gives me help and I do my duty honestly, no doubt I’ll govern
better than a gerfalcon. Nay, let them only put a finger in my mouth, and
they’ll see whether I can bite or not.”
</p>
<p>
“The curse of God and all his saints upon thee, thou accursed
Sancho!” exclaimed Don Quixote; “when will the day come—as
I have often said to thee—when I shall hear thee make one single
coherent, rational remark without proverbs? Pray, your highnesses, leave
this fool alone, for he will grind your souls between, not to say two, but
two thousand proverbs, dragged in as much in season, and as much to the
purpose as—may God grant as much health to him, or to me if I want
to listen to them!”
</p>
<p>
“Sancho Panza’s proverbs,” said the duchess, “though
more in number than the Greek Commander’s, are not therefore less to
be esteemed for the conciseness of the maxims. For my own part, I can say
they give me more pleasure than others that may be better brought in and
more seasonably introduced.”
</p>
<p>
In pleasant conversation of this sort they passed out of the tent into the
wood, and the day was spent in visiting some of the posts and
hiding-places, and then night closed in, not, however, as brilliantly or
tranquilly as might have been expected at the season, for it was then
midsummer; but bringing with it a kind of haze that greatly aided the
project of the duke and duchess; and thus, as night began to fall, and a
little after twilight set in, suddenly the whole wood on all four sides
seemed to be on fire, and shortly after, here, there, on all sides, a vast
number of trumpets and other military instruments were heard, as if
several troops of cavalry were passing through the wood. The blaze of the
fire and the noise of the warlike instruments almost blinded the eyes and
deafened the ears of those that stood by, and indeed of all who were in
the wood. Then there were heard repeated lelilies after the fashion of the
Moors when they rush to battle; trumpets and clarions brayed, drums beat,
fifes played, so unceasingly and so fast that he could not have had any
senses who did not lose them with the confused din of so many instruments.
The duke was astounded, the duchess amazed, Don Quixote wondering, Sancho
Panza trembling, and indeed, even they who were aware of the cause were
frightened. In their fear, silence fell upon them, and a postillion, in
the guise of a demon, passed in front of them, blowing, in lieu of a
bugle, a huge hollow horn that gave out a horrible hoarse note.
</p>
<p>
“Ho there! brother courier,” cried the duke, “who are
you? Where are you going? What troops are these that seem to be passing
through the wood?”
</p>
<p>
To which the courier replied in a harsh, discordant voice, “I am the
devil; I am in search of Don Quixote of La Mancha; those who are coming
this way are six troops of enchanters, who are bringing on a triumphal car
the peerless Dulcinea del Toboso; she comes under enchantment, together
with the gallant Frenchman Montesinos, to give instructions to Don Quixote
as to how, she the said lady, may be disenchanted.”
</p>
<p>
“If you were the devil, as you say and as your appearance indicates,”
said the duke, “you would have known the said knight Don Quixote of
La Mancha, for you have him here before you.”
</p>
<p>
“By God and upon my conscience,” said the devil, “I
never observed it, for my mind is occupied with so many different things
that I was forgetting the main thing I came about.”
</p>
<p>
“This demon must be an honest fellow and a good Christian,”
said Sancho; “for if he wasn’t he wouldn’t swear by God
and his conscience; I feel sure now there must be good souls even in hell
itself.”
</p>
<p>
Without dismounting, the demon then turned to Don Quixote and said,
“The unfortunate but valiant knight Montesinos sends me to thee, the
Knight of the Lions (would that I saw thee in their claws), bidding me
tell thee to wait for him wherever I may find thee, as he brings with him
her whom they call Dulcinea del Toboso, that he may show thee what is
needful in order to disenchant her; and as I came for no more I need stay
no longer; demons of my sort be with thee, and good angels with these
gentles;” and so saying he blew his huge horn, turned about and went
off without waiting for a reply from anyone.
</p>
<p>
They all felt fresh wonder, but particularly Sancho and Don Quixote;
Sancho to see how, in defiance of the truth, they would have it that
Dulcinea was enchanted; Don Quixote because he could not feel sure whether
what had happened to him in the cave of Montesinos was true or not; and as
he was deep in these cogitations the duke said to him, “Do you mean
to wait, Señor Don Quixote?”
</p>
<p>
“Why not?” replied he; “here will I wait, fearless and
firm, though all hell should come to attack me.”
</p>
<p>
“Well then, if I see another devil or hear another horn like the
last, I’ll wait here as much as in Flanders,” said Sancho.
</p>
<p>
Night now closed in more completely, and many lights began to flit through
the wood, just as those fiery exhalations from the earth, that look like
shooting-stars to our eyes, flit through the heavens; a frightful noise,
too, was heard, like that made by the solid wheels the ox-carts usually
have, by the harsh, ceaseless creaking of which, they say, the bears and
wolves are put to flight, if there happen to be any where they are
passing. In addition to all this commotion, there came a further
disturbance to increase the tumult, for now it seemed as if in truth, on
all four sides of the wood, four encounters or battles were going on at
the same time; in one quarter resounded the dull noise of a terrible
cannonade, in another numberless muskets were being discharged, the shouts
of the combatants sounded almost close at hand, and farther away the
Moorish lelilies were raised again and again. In a word, the bugles, the
horns, the clarions, the trumpets, the drums, the cannon, the musketry,
and above all the tremendous noise of the carts, all made up together a
din so confused and terrific that Don Quixote had need to summon up all
his courage to brave it; but Sancho’s gave way, and he fell fainting
on the skirt of the duchess’s robe, who let him lie there and
promptly bade them throw water in his face. This was done, and he came to
himself by the time that one of the carts with the creaking wheels reached
the spot. It was drawn by four plodding oxen all covered with black
housings; on each horn they had fixed a large lighted wax taper, and on
the top of the cart was constructed a raised seat, on which sat a
venerable old man with a beard whiter than the very snow, and so long that
it fell below his waist; he was dressed in a long robe of black buckram;
for as the cart was thickly set with a multitude of candles it was easy to
make out everything that was on it. Leading it were two hideous demons,
also clad in buckram, with countenances so frightful that Sancho, having
once seen them, shut his eyes so as not to see them again. As soon as the
cart came opposite the spot the old man rose from his lofty seat, and
standing up said in a loud voice, “I am the sage Lirgandeo,”
and without another word the cart then passed on. Behind it came another
of the same form, with another aged man enthroned, who, stopping the cart,
said in a voice no less solemn than that of the first, “I am the
sage Alquife, the great friend of Urganda the Unknown,” and passed
on. Then another cart came by at the same pace, but the occupant of the
throne was not old like the others, but a man stalwart and robust, and of
a forbidding countenance, who as he came up said in a voice far hoarser
and more devilish, “I am the enchanter Archelaus, the mortal enemy
which involves the protection of women of all sorts, especially widowed,
of Amadis of Gaul and all his kindred,” and then passed on. Having
gone a short distance the three carts halted and the monotonous noise of
their wheels ceased, and soon after they heard another, not noise, but
sound of sweet, harmonious music, of which Sancho was very glad, taking it
to be a good sign; and said he to the duchess, from whom he did not stir a
step, or for a single instant, “Señora, where there’s music
there can’t be mischief.”
</p>
<p>
“Nor where there are lights and it is bright,” said the
duchess; to which Sancho replied, “Fire gives light, and it’s
bright where there are bonfires, as we see by those that are all round us
and perhaps may burn us; but music is a sign of mirth and merrymaking.”
</p>
<p>
“That remains to be seen,” said Don Quixote, who was listening
to all that passed; and he was right, as is shown in the following
chapter.

They saw advancing towards them, to the sound of this pleasing music, what
they call a triumphal car, drawn by six grey mules with white linen
housings, on each of which was mounted a penitent, robed also in white,
with a large lighted wax taper in his hand. The car was twice or, perhaps,
three times as large as the former ones, and in front and on the sides
stood twelve more penitents, all as white as snow and all with lighted
tapers, a spectacle to excite fear as well as wonder; and on a raised
throne was seated a nymph draped in a multitude of silver-tissue veils
with an embroidery of countless gold spangles glittering all over them,
that made her appear, if not richly, at least brilliantly, apparelled. She
had her face covered with thin transparent sendal, the texture of which
did not prevent the fair features of a maiden from being distinguished,
while the numerous lights made it possible to judge of her beauty and of
her years, which seemed to be not less than seventeen but not to have yet
reached twenty. Beside her was a figure in a robe of state, as they call
it, reaching to the feet, while the head was covered with a black veil.
But the instant the car was opposite the duke and duchess and Don Quixote
the music of the clarions ceased, and then that of the lutes and harps on
the car, and the figure in the robe rose up, and flinging it apart and
removing the veil from its face, disclosed to their eyes the shape of
Death itself, fleshless and hideous, at which sight Don Quixote felt
uneasy, Sancho frightened, and the duke and duchess displayed a certain
trepidation. Having risen to its feet, this living death, in a sleepy
voice and with a tongue hardly awake, held forth as follows:

<p class="poem">
I am that Merlin who the legends say<br>
The devil had for father, and the lie<br>
Hath gathered credence with the lapse of time.<br>
Of magic prince, of Zoroastric lore<br>
Monarch and treasurer, with jealous eye<br>
I view the efforts of the age to hide<br>
The gallant deeds of doughty errant knights,<br>
Who are, and ever have been, dear to me.<br>
    Enchanters and magicians and their kind<br>
Are mostly hard of heart; not so am I;<br>
For mine is tender, soft, compassionate,<br>
And its delight is doing good to all.<br>
In the dim caverns of the gloomy Dis,<br>
Where, tracing mystic lines and characters,<br>
My soul abideth now, there came to me<br>
The sorrow-laden plaint of her, the fair,<br>
The peerless Dulcinea del Toboso.<br>
I knew of her enchantment and her fate,<br>
From high-born dame to peasant wench transformed<br>
And touched with pity, first I turned the leaves<br>
Of countless volumes of my devilish craft,<br>
And then, in this grim grisly skeleton<br>
Myself encasing, hither have I come<br>
To show where lies the fitting remedy<br>
To give relief in such a piteous case.<br>
    O thou, the pride and pink of all that I wear<br>
The adamantine steel! O shining light,<br>
O beacon, polestar, path and guide of all<br>
Who, scorning slumber and the lazy down,<br>
Adopt the toilsome life of bloodstained arms!<br>
To thee, great hero who all praise transcends,<br>
La Mancha’s lustre and Iberia’s star,<br>
Don Quixote, wise as brave, to thee I say—<br>
For peerless Dulcinea del Toboso<br>
Her pristine form and beauty to regain,<br>
’Tis needful that thy esquire Sancho shall,<br>
On his own sturdy buttocks bared to heaven,<br>
Three thousand and three hundred lashes lay,<br>
And that they smart and sting and hurt him well.<br>
Thus have the authors of her woe resolved.<br>
And this is, gentles, wherefore I have come.<br>
</p>
<p>
“By all that’s good,” exclaimed Sancho at this, “I’ll
just as soon give myself three stabs with a dagger as three, not to say
three thousand, lashes. The devil take such a way of disenchanting! I don’t
see what my backside has got to do with enchantments. By God, if Señor
Merlin has not found out some other way of disenchanting the lady Dulcinea
del Toboso, she may go to her grave enchanted.”
</p>
<p>
“But I’ll take you, Don Clown stuffed with garlic,” said
Don Quixote, “and tie you to a tree as naked as when your mother
brought you forth, and give you, not to say three thousand three hundred,
but six thousand six hundred lashes, and so well laid on that they won’t
be got rid of if you try three thousand three hundred times; don’t
answer me a word or I’ll tear your soul out.”
</p>
<p>
On hearing this Merlin said, “That will not do, for the lashes
worthy Sancho has to receive must be given of his own free will and not by
force, and at whatever time he pleases, for there is no fixed limit
assigned to him; but it is permitted him, if he likes to commute by half
the pain of this whipping, to let them be given by the hand of another,
though it may be somewhat weighty.”
</p>
<p>
“Not a hand, my own or anybody else’s, weighty or weighable,
shall touch me,” said Sancho. “Was it I that gave birth to the
lady Dulcinea del Toboso, that my backside is to pay for the sins of her
eyes? My master, indeed, that’s a part of her—for, he’s
always calling her ‘my life’ and ‘my soul,’ and
his stay and prop—may and ought to whip himself for her and take all
the trouble required for her disenchantment. But for me to whip myself!
Abernuncio!”
</p>
<p>
As soon as Sancho had done speaking the nymph in silver that was at the
side of Merlin’s ghost stood up, and removing the thin veil from her
face disclosed one that seemed to all something more than exceedingly
beautiful; and with a masculine freedom from embarrassment and in a voice
not very like a lady’s, addressing Sancho directly, said, “Thou
wretched squire, soul of a pitcher, heart of a cork tree, with bowels of
flint and pebbles; if, thou impudent thief, they bade thee throw thyself
down from some lofty tower; if, enemy of mankind, they asked thee to
swallow a dozen of toads, two of lizards, and three of adders; if they
wanted thee to slay thy wife and children with a sharp murderous scimitar,
it would be no wonder for thee to show thyself stubborn and squeamish. But
to make a piece of work about three thousand three hundred lashes, what
every poor little charity-boy gets every month—it is enough to
amaze, astonish, astound the compassionate bowels of all who hear it, nay,
all who come to hear it in the course of time. Turn, O miserable,
hard-hearted animal, turn, I say, those timorous owl’s eyes upon
these of mine that are compared to radiant stars, and thou wilt see them
weeping trickling streams and rills, and tracing furrows, tracks, and
paths over the fair fields of my cheeks. Let it move thee, crafty,
ill-conditioned monster, to see my blooming youth—still in its
teens, for I am not yet twenty—wasting and withering away beneath
the husk of a rude peasant wench; and if I do not appear in that shape
now, it is a special favour Señor Merlin here has granted me, to the sole
end that my beauty may soften thee; for the tears of beauty in distress
turn rocks into cotton and tigers into ewes. Lay on to that hide of thine,
thou great untamed brute, rouse up thy lusty vigour that only urges thee
to eat and eat, and set free the softness of my flesh, the gentleness of
my nature, and the fairness of my face. And if thou wilt not relent or
come to reason for me, do so for the sake of that poor knight thou hast
beside thee; thy master I mean, whose soul I can this moment see, how he
has it stuck in his throat not ten fingers from his lips, and only waiting
for thy inflexible or yielding reply to make its escape by his mouth or go
back again into his stomach.”
</p>
<p>
Don Quixote on hearing this felt his throat, and turning to the duke he
said, “By God, señor, Dulcinea says true, I have my soul stuck here
in my throat like the nut of a crossbow.”
</p>
<p>
“What say you to this, Sancho?” said the duchess.
</p>
<p>
“I say, señora,” returned Sancho, “what I said before;
as for the lashes, abernuncio!”
</p>
<p>
“Abrenuncio, you should say, Sancho, and not as you do,” said
the duke.
</p>
<p>
“Let me alone, your highness,” said Sancho. “I’m
not in a humour now to look into niceties or a letter more or less, for
these lashes that are to be given me, or I’m to give myself, have so
upset me, that I don’t know what I’m saying or doing. But I’d
like to know of this lady, my lady Dulcinea del Toboso, where she learned
this way she has of asking favours. She comes to ask me to score my flesh
with lashes, and she calls me soul of a pitcher, and great untamed brute,
and a string of foul names that the devil is welcome to. Is my flesh
brass? or is it anything to me whether she is enchanted or not? Does she
bring with her a basket of fair linen, shirts, kerchiefs, socks—not
that I wear any—to coax me? No, nothing but one piece of abuse after
another, though she knows the proverb they have here that ‘an ass
loaded with gold goes lightly up a mountain,’ and that ‘gifts
break rocks,’ and ‘praying to God and plying the hammer,’
and that ‘one “take” is better than two “I’ll
<div class="fig" style="width:60%;">
give thee’s.”’ Then there’s my master, who ought
to stroke me down and pet me to make me turn wool and carded cotton; he
says if he gets hold of me he’ll tie me naked to a tree and double
the tale of lashes on me. These tender-hearted gentry should consider that
it’s not merely a squire, but a governor they are asking to whip
himself; just as if it was ‘drink with cherries.’ Let them
learn, plague take them, the right way to ask, and beg, and behave
themselves; for all times are not alike, nor are people always in good
humour. I’m now ready to burst with grief at seeing my green coat
torn, and they come to ask me to whip myself of my own free will, I having
as little fancy for it as for turning cacique.”
</p>
<p>
“Well then, the fact is, friend Sancho,” said the duke,
“that unless you become softer than a ripe fig, you shall not get
hold of the government. It would be a nice thing for me to send my
islanders a cruel governor with flinty bowels, who won’t yield to
the tears of afflicted damsels or to the prayers of wise, magisterial,
ancient enchanters and sages. In short, Sancho, either you must be whipped
by yourself, or they must whip you, or you shan’t be governor.”
</p>
<p>
“Señor,” said Sancho, “won’t two days’ grace
be given me in which to consider what is best for me?”
</p>
<p>
“No, certainly not,” said Merlin; “here, this minute,
and on the spot, the matter must be settled; either Dulcinea will return
to the cave of Montesinos and to her former condition of peasant wench, or
else in her present form shall be carried to the Elysian fields, where she
will remain waiting until the number of stripes is completed.”
</p>
<p>
“Now then, Sancho!” said the duchess, “show courage, and
gratitude for your master Don Quixote’s bread that you have eaten;
we are all bound to oblige and please him for his benevolent disposition
and lofty chivalry. Consent to this whipping, my son; to the devil with
the devil, and leave fear to milksops, for ‘a stout heart breaks bad
luck,’ as you very well know.”
</p>
<p>
To this Sancho replied with an irrelevant remark, which, addressing
Merlin, he made to him, “Will your worship tell me, Señor Merlin—when
that courier devil came up he gave my master a message from Señor
Montesinos, charging him to wait for him here, as he was coming to arrange
how the lady Doña Dulcinea del Toboso was to be disenchanted; but up to
the present we have not seen Montesinos, nor anything like him.”
</p>
<p>
To which Merlin made answer, “The devil, Sancho, is a blockhead and
a great scoundrel; I sent him to look for your master, but not with a
message from Montesinos but from myself; for Montesinos is in his cave
expecting, or more properly speaking, waiting for his disenchantment; for
there’s the tail to be skinned yet for him; if he owes you anything,
or you have any business to transact with him, I’ll bring him to you
and put him where you choose; but for the present make up your mind to
consent to this penance, and believe me it will be very good for you, for
soul as well for body—for your soul because of the charity with
which you perform it, for your body because I know that you are of a
sanguine habit and it will do you no harm to draw a little blood.”
</p>
<p>
“There are a great many doctors in the world; even the enchanters
are doctors,” said Sancho; “however, as everybody tells me the
same thing—though I can’t see it myself—I say I am
willing to give myself the three thousand three hundred lashes, provided I
am to lay them on whenever I like, without any fixing of days or times;
and I’ll try and get out of debt as quickly as I can, that the world
may enjoy the beauty of the lady Dulcinea del Toboso; as it seems,
contrary to what I thought, that she is beautiful after all. It must be a
condition, too, that I am not to be bound to draw blood with the scourge,
and that if any of the lashes happen to be fly-flappers they are to count.
Item, that, in case I should make any mistake in the reckoning, Señor
Merlin, as he knows everything, is to keep count, and let me know how many
are still wanting or over the number.”
</p>
<p>
“There will be no need to let you know of any over,” said
Merlin, “because, when you reach the full number, the lady Dulcinea
will at once, and that very instant, be disenchanted, and will come in her
gratitude to seek out the worthy Sancho, and thank him, and even reward
him for the good work. So you have no cause to be uneasy about stripes too
many or too few; heaven forbid I should cheat anyone of even a hair of his
head.”
</p>
<p>
“Well then, in God’s hands be it,” said Sancho; “in
the hard case I’m in I give in; I say I accept the penance on the
conditions laid down.”
</p>
<p>
The instant Sancho uttered these last words the music of the clarions
struck up once more, and again a host of muskets were discharged, and Don
Quixote hung on Sancho’s neck kissing him again and again on the
forehead and cheeks. The duchess and the duke expressed the greatest
satisfaction, the car began to move on, and as it passed the fair Dulcinea
bowed to the duke and duchess and made a low curtsey to Sancho.

And now bright smiling dawn came on apace; the flowers of the field,
revived, raised up their heads, and the crystal waters of the brooks,
murmuring over the grey and white pebbles, hastened to pay their tribute
to the expectant rivers; the glad earth, the unclouded sky, the fresh
breeze, the clear light, each and all showed that the day that came
treading on the skirts of morning would be calm and bright. The duke and
duchess, pleased with their hunt and at having carried out their plans so
cleverly and successfully, returned to their castle resolved to follow up
their joke; for to them there was no reality that could afford them more
amusement.

</p>
<p>
The duke had a majordomo of a very facetious and sportive turn, and he it
was that played the part of Merlin, made all the arrangements for the late
adventure, composed the verses, and got a page to represent Dulcinea; and
now, with the assistance of his master and mistress, he got up another of
the drollest and strangest contrivances that can be imagined.
</p>
<p>
The duchess asked Sancho the next day if he had made a beginning with his
penance task which he had to perform for the disenchantment of Dulcinea.
He said he had, and had given himself five lashes overnight.
</p>
<p>
The duchess asked him what he had given them with.
</p>
<p>
He said with his hand.
</p>
<p>
“That,” said the duchess, “is more like giving oneself
slaps than lashes; I am sure the sage Merlin will not be satisfied with
such tenderness; worthy Sancho must make a scourge with claws, or a cat-o’-nine
tails, that will make itself felt; for it’s with blood that letters
enter, and the release of so great a lady as Dulcinea will not be granted
so cheaply, or at such a paltry price; and remember, Sancho, that works of
charity done in a lukewarm and half-hearted way are without merit and of
no avail.”
</p>
<p>
To which Sancho replied, “If your ladyship will give me a proper
scourge or cord, I’ll lay on with it, provided it does not hurt too
much; for you must know, boor as I am, my flesh is more cotton than hemp,
and it won’t do for me to destroy myself for the good of anybody
else.”
</p>
<p>
“So be it by all means,” said the duchess; “to-morrow I’ll
give you a scourge that will be just the thing for you, and will
accommodate itself to the tenderness of your flesh, as if it was its own
sister.”
</p>
<p>
Then said Sancho, “Your highness must know, dear lady of my soul,
that I have a letter written to my wife, Teresa Panza, giving her an
account of all that has happened me since I left her; I have it here in my
bosom, and there’s nothing wanting but to put the address to it; I’d
be glad if your discretion would read it, for I think it runs in the
governor style; I mean the way governors ought to write.”
</p>
<p>
“And who dictated it?” asked the duchess.
</p>
<p>
“Who should have dictated but myself, sinner as I am?” said
Sancho.
</p>
<p>
“And did you write it yourself?” said the duchess.
</p>
<p>
“That I didn’t,” said Sancho; “for I can neither
read nor write, though I can sign my name.”
</p>
<p>
“Let us see it,” said the duchess, “for never fear but
you display in it the quality and quantity of your wit.”
</p>
<p>
Sancho drew out an open letter from his bosom, and the duchess, taking it,
found it ran in this fashion:
</p>
<p class="center">
SANCHO PANZA’S LETTER TO HIS WIFE, TERESA PANZA
</p>
<p class="letter">
If I was well whipped I went mounted like a gentleman; if I have got a good
government it is at the cost of a good whipping. Thou wilt not understand this
just now, my Teresa; by-and-by thou wilt know what it means. I may tell thee,
Teresa, I mean thee to go in a coach, for that is a matter of importance,
because every other way of going is going on all-fours. Thou art a
governor’s wife; take care that nobody speaks evil of thee behind thy
back. I send thee here a green hunting suit that my lady the duchess gave me;
alter it so as to make a petticoat and bodice for our daughter. Don Quixote, my
master, if I am to believe what I hear in these parts, is a madman of some
sense, and a droll blockhead, and I am in no way behind him. We have been in
the cave of Montesinos, and the sage Merlin has laid hold of me for the
disenchantment of Dulcinea del Toboso, her that is called Aldonza Lorenzo over
there. With three thousand three hundred lashes, less five, that I’m to
give myself, she will be left as entirely disenchanted as the mother that bore
her. Say nothing of this to anyone; for, make thy affairs public, and some will
say they are white and others will say they are black. I shall leave this in a
few days for my government, to which I am going with a mighty great desire to
make money, for they tell me all new governors set out with the same desire; I
will feel the pulse of it and will let thee know if thou art to come and live
with me or not. Dapple is well and sends many remembrances to thee; I am not
going to leave him behind though they took me away to be Grand Turk. My lady
the duchess kisses thy hands a thousand times; do thou make a return with two
thousand, for as my master says, nothing costs less or is cheaper than
civility. God has not been pleased to provide another valise for me with
another hundred crowns, like the one the other day; but never mind, my Teresa,
the bell-ringer is in safe quarters, and all will come out in the scouring of
the government; only it troubles me greatly what they tell me—that once I
have tasted it I will eat my hands off after it; and if that is so it will not
come very cheap to me; though to be sure the maimed have a benefice of their
own in the alms they beg for; so that one way or another thou wilt be rich and
in luck. God give it to thee as he can, and keep me to serve thee. From this
castle, the 20th of July, 1614.
</p>
<p class="right">
Thy husband, the governor,<br>
SANCHO PANZA
</p>
<p>
When she had done reading the letter the duchess said to Sancho, “On
two points the worthy governor goes rather astray; one is in saying or
hinting that this government has been bestowed upon him for the lashes
that he is to give himself, when he knows (and he cannot deny it) that
when my lord the duke promised it to him nobody ever dreamt of such a
thing as lashes; the other is that he shows himself here to be very
covetous; and I would not have him a money-seeker, for ‘covetousness
bursts the bag,’ and the covetous governor does ungoverned justice.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t mean it that way, señora,” said Sancho; “and
if you think the letter doesn’t run as it ought to do, it’s
only to tear it up and make another; and maybe it will be a worse one if
it is left to my gumption.”
</p>
<p>
“No, no,” said the duchess, “this one will do, and I
wish the duke to see it.”
</p>
<p>
With this they betook themselves to a garden where they were to dine, and
the duchess showed Sancho’s letter to the duke, who was highly
delighted with it. They dined, and after the cloth had been removed and
they had amused themselves for a while with Sancho’s rich
conversation, the melancholy sound of a fife and harsh discordant drum
made itself heard. All seemed somewhat put out by this dull, confused,
martial harmony, especially Don Quixote, who could not keep his seat from
pure disquietude; as to Sancho, it is needless to say that fear drove him
to his usual refuge, the side or the skirts of the duchess; and indeed and
in truth the sound they heard was a most doleful and melancholy one. While
they were still in uncertainty they saw advancing towards them through the
garden two men clad in mourning robes so long and flowing that they
trailed upon the ground. As they marched they beat two great drums which
were likewise draped in black, and beside them came the fife player, black
and sombre like the others. Following these came a personage of gigantic
stature enveloped rather than clad in a gown of the deepest black, the
skirt of which was of prodigious dimensions. Over the gown, girdling or
crossing his figure, he had a broad baldric which was also black, and from
which hung a huge scimitar with a black scabbard and furniture. He had his
face covered with a transparent black veil, through which might be
descried a very long beard as white as snow. He came on keeping step to
the sound of the drums with great gravity and dignity; and, in short, his
stature, his gait, the sombreness of his appearance and his following
might well have struck with astonishment, as they did, all who beheld him
without knowing who he was. With this measured pace and in this guise he
advanced to kneel before the duke, who, with the others, awaited him
standing. The duke, however, would not on any account allow him to speak
until he had risen. The prodigious scarecrow obeyed, and standing up,
removed the veil from his face and disclosed the most enormous, the
longest, the whitest and the thickest beard that human eyes had ever
beheld until that moment, and then fetching up a grave, sonorous voice
from the depths of his broad, capacious chest, and fixing his eyes on the
duke, he said:
</p>
<p>
“Most high and mighty señor, my name is Trifaldin of the White
Beard; I am squire to the Countess Trifaldi, otherwise called the
Distressed Duenna, on whose behalf I bear a message to your highness,
which is that your magnificence will be pleased to grant her leave and
permission to come and tell you her trouble, which is one of the strangest
and most wonderful that the mind most familiar with trouble in the world
could have imagined; but first she desires to know if the valiant and
never vanquished knight, Don Quixote of La Mancha, is in this your castle,
for she has come in quest of him on foot and without breaking her fast
from the kingdom of Kandy to your realms here; a thing which may and ought
to be regarded as a miracle or set down to enchantment; she is even now at
the gate of this fortress or plaisance, and only waits for your permission
to enter. I have spoken.” And with that he coughed, and stroked down
his beard with both his hands, and stood very tranquilly waiting for the
response of the duke, which was to this effect: “Many days ago,
worthy squire Trifaldin of the White Beard, we heard of the misfortune of
my lady the Countess Trifaldi, whom the enchanters have caused to be
called the Distressed Duenna. Bid her enter, O stupendous squire, and tell
her that the valiant knight Don Quixote of La Mancha is here, and from his
generous disposition she may safely promise herself every protection and
assistance; and you may tell her, too, that if my aid be necessary it will
not be withheld, for I am bound to give it to her by my quality of knight,
which involves the protection of women of all sorts, especially widowed,
wronged, and distressed dames, such as her ladyship seems to be.”
</p>
<p>
On hearing this Trifaldin bent the knee to the ground, and making a sign
to the fifer and drummers to strike up, he turned and marched out of the
garden to the same notes and at the same pace as when he entered, leaving
them all amazed at his bearing and solemnity. Turning to Don Quixote, the
duke said, “After all, renowned knight, the mists of malice and
ignorance are unable to hide or obscure the light of valour and virtue. I
say so, because your excellence has been barely six days in this castle,
and already the unhappy and the afflicted come in quest of you from lands
far distant and remote, and not in coaches or on dromedaries, but on foot
and fasting, confident that in that mighty arm they will find a cure for
their sorrows and troubles; thanks to your great achievements, which are
circulated all over the known earth.”
</p>
<p>
“I wish, señor duke,” replied Don Quixote, “that blessed
ecclesiastic, who at table the other day showed such ill-will and bitter
spite against knights-errant, were here now to see with his own eyes
whether knights of the sort are needed in the world; he would at any rate
learn by experience that those suffering any extraordinary affliction or
sorrow, in extreme cases and unusual misfortunes do not go to look for a
remedy to the houses of jurists or village sacristans, or to the knight
who has never attempted to pass the bounds of his own town, or to the
indolent courtier who only seeks for news to repeat and talk of, instead
of striving to do deeds and exploits for others to relate and record.
Relief in distress, help in need, protection for damsels, consolation for
widows, are to be found in no sort of persons better than in
knights-errant; and I give unceasing thanks to heaven that I am one, and
regard any misfortune or suffering that may befall me in the pursuit of so
honourable a calling as endured to good purpose. Let this duenna come and
ask what she will, for I will effect her relief by the might of my arm and
the dauntless resolution of my bold heart.”

</p>
<p>
The duke and duchess were extremely glad to see how readily Don Quixote
fell in with their scheme; but at this moment Sancho observed, “I
hope this señora duenna won’t be putting any difficulties in the way
of the promise of my government; for I have heard a Toledo apothecary, who
talked like a goldfinch, say that where duennas were mixed up nothing good
could happen. God bless me, how he hated them, that same apothecary! And
so what I’m thinking is, if all duennas, of whatever sort or
condition they may be, are plagues and busybodies, what must they be that
are distressed, like this Countess Three-skirts or Three-tails!—for
in my country skirts or tails, tails or skirts, it’s all one.”
</p>
<p>
“Hush, friend Sancho,” said Don Quixote; “since this
lady duenna comes in quest of me from such a distant land she cannot be
one of those the apothecary meant; moreover this is a countess, and when
countesses serve as duennas it is in the service of queens and empresses,
for in their own houses they are mistresses paramount and have other
duennas to wait on them.”
</p>
<p>
To this Doña Rodriguez, who was present, made answer, “My lady the
duchess has duennas in her service that might be countesses if it was the
will of fortune; ‘but laws go as kings like;’ let nobody speak
ill of duennas, above all of ancient maiden ones; for though I am not one
myself, I know and am aware of the advantage a maiden duenna has over one
that is a widow; but ‘he who clipped us has kept the scissors.’”
</p>
<p>
“For all that,” said Sancho, “there’s so much to
be clipped about duennas, so my barber said, that ‘it will be better
not to stir the rice even though it sticks.’”
</p>
<p>
“These squires,” returned Doña Rodriguez, “are always
our enemies; and as they are the haunting spirits of the antechambers and
watch us at every step, whenever they are not saying their prayers (and
that’s often enough) they spend their time in tattling about us,
digging up our bones and burying our good name. But I can tell these
walking blocks that we will live in spite of them, and in great houses
too, though we die of hunger and cover our flesh, be it delicate or not,
with widow’s weeds, as one covers or hides a dunghill on a
procession day. By my faith, if it were permitted me and time allowed, I
could prove, not only to those here present, but to all the world, that
there is no virtue that is not to be found in a duenna.”
</p>
<p>
“I have no doubt,” said the duchess, “that my good Doña
Rodriguez is right, and very much so; but she had better bide her time for
fighting her own battle and that of the rest of the duennas, so as to
crush the calumny of that vile apothecary, and root out the prejudice in
the great Sancho Panza’s mind.”
</p>
<p>
To which Sancho replied, “Ever since I have sniffed the governorship
I have got rid of the humours of a squire, and I don’t care a wild
fig for all the duennas in the world.”
</p>
<p>
They would have carried on this duenna dispute further had they not heard
the notes of the fife and drums once more, from which they concluded that
the Distressed Duenna was making her entrance. The duchess asked the duke
if it would be proper to go out to receive her, as she was a countess and
a person of rank.
</p>
<p>
“In respect of her being a countess,” said Sancho, before the
duke could reply, “I am for your highnesses going out to receive
her; but in respect of her being a duenna, it is my opinion you should not
stir a step.”
</p>
<p>
“Who bade thee meddle in this, Sancho?” said Don Quixote.
</p>
<p>
“Who, señor?” said Sancho; “I meddle for I have a right
to meddle, as a squire who has learned the rules of courtesy in the school
of your worship, the most courteous and best-bred knight in the whole
world of courtliness; and in these things, as I have heard your worship
say, as much is lost by a card too many as by a card too few, and to one
who has his ears open, few words.”
</p>
<p>
“Sancho is right,” said the duke; “we’ll see what
the countess is like, and by that measure the courtesy that is due to her.”
</p>
<p>
And now the drums and fife made their entrance as before; and here the
author brought this short chapter to an end and began the next, following
up the same adventure, which is one of the most notable in the history.

Following the melancholy musicians there filed into the garden as many as
twelve duennas, in two lines, all dressed in ample mourning robes
apparently of milled serge, with hoods of fine white gauze so long that
they allowed only the border of the robe to be seen. Behind them came the
Countess Trifaldi, the squire Trifaldin of the White Beard leading her by
the hand, clad in the finest unnapped black baize, such that, had it a
nap, every tuft would have shown as big as a Martos chickpea; the tail, or
skirt, or whatever it might be called, ended in three points which were
borne up by the hands of three pages, likewise dressed in mourning,
forming an elegant geometrical figure with the three acute angles made by
the three points, from which all who saw the peaked skirt concluded that
it must be because of it the countess was called Trifaldi, as though it
were Countess of the Three Skirts; and Benengeli says it was so, and that
by her right name she was called the Countess Lobuna, because wolves bred
in great numbers in her country; and if, instead of wolves, they had been
foxes, she would have been called the Countess Zorruna, as it was the
custom in those parts for lords to take distinctive titles from the thing
or things most abundant in their dominions; this countess, however, in
honour of the new fashion of her skirt, dropped Lobuna and took up
Trifaldi.
</p>
<p>
The twelve duennas and the lady came on at procession pace, their faces
being covered with black veils, not transparent ones like Trifaldin’s,
but so close that they allowed nothing to be seen through them. As soon as
the band of duennas was fully in sight, the duke, the duchess, and Don
Quixote stood up, as well as all who were watching the slow-moving
procession. The twelve duennas halted and formed a lane, along which the
Distressed One advanced, Trifaldin still holding her hand. On seeing this
the duke, the duchess, and Don Quixote went some twelve paces forward to
meet her. She then, kneeling on the ground, said in a voice hoarse and
rough, rather than fine and delicate, “May it please your highnesses
not to offer such courtesies to this your servant, I should say to this
your handmaid, for I am in such distress that I shall never be able to
make a proper return, because my strange and unparalleled misfortune has
carried off my wits, and I know not whither; but it must be a long way
off, for the more I look for them the less I find them.”
</p>
<p>
“He would be wanting in wits, señora countess,” said the duke,
“who did not perceive your worth by your person, for at a glance it
may be seen it deserves all the cream of courtesy and flower of polite
usage;” and raising her up by the hand he led her to a seat beside
the duchess, who likewise received her with great urbanity. Don Quixote
remained silent, while Sancho was dying to see the features of Trifaldi
and one or two of her many duennas; but there was no possibility of it
until they themselves displayed them of their own accord and free will.
</p>
<p>
All kept still, waiting to see who would break silence, which the
Distressed Duenna did in these words: “I am confident, most mighty
lord, most fair lady, and most discreet company, that my most miserable
misery will be accorded a reception no less dispassionate than generous
and condolent in your most valiant bosoms, for it is one that is enough to
melt marble, soften diamonds, and mollify the steel of the most hardened
hearts in the world; but ere it is proclaimed to your hearing, not to say
your ears, I would fain be enlightened whether there be present in this
society, circle, or company, that knight immaculatissimus, Don Quixote de
la Manchissima, and his squirissimus Panza.”
</p>
<p>
“The Panza is here,” said Sancho, before anyone could reply,
“and Don Quixotissimus too; and so, most distressedest Duenissima,
you may say what you willissimus, for we are all readissimus to do you any
servissimus.”
</p>
<p>
On this Don Quixote rose, and addressing the Distressed Duenna, said,
“If your sorrows, afflicted lady, can indulge in any hope of relief
from the valour or might of any knight-errant, here are mine, which,
feeble and limited though they be, shall be entirely devoted to your
service. I am Don Quixote of La Mancha, whose calling it is to give aid to
the needy of all sorts; and that being so, it is not necessary for you,
señora, to make any appeal to benevolence, or deal in preambles, only to
tell your woes plainly and straightforwardly: for you have hearers that
will know how, if not to remedy them, to sympathise with them.”
</p>
<p>
On hearing this, the Distressed Duenna made as though she would throw
herself at Don Quixote’s feet, and actually did fall before them and
said, as she strove to embrace them, “Before these feet and legs I
cast myself, O unconquered knight, as before, what they are, the
foundations and pillars of knight-errantry; these feet I desire to kiss,
for upon their steps hangs and depends the sole remedy for my misfortune,
O valorous errant, whose veritable achievements leave behind and eclipse
the fabulous ones of the Amadises, Esplandians, and Belianises!”
Then turning from Don Quixote to Sancho Panza, and grasping his hands, she
said, “O thou, most loyal squire that ever served knight-errant in
this present age or ages past, whose goodness is more extensive than the
beard of Trifaldin my companion here of present, well mayest thou boast
thyself that, in serving the great Don Quixote, thou art serving, summed
up in one, the whole host of knights that have ever borne arms in the
world. I conjure thee, by what thou owest to thy most loyal goodness, that
thou wilt become my kind intercessor with thy master, that he speedily
give aid to this most humble and most unfortunate countess.”
</p>
<p>
To this Sancho made answer, “As to my goodness, señora, being as
long and as great as your squire’s beard, it matters very little to
me; may I have my soul well bearded and moustached when it comes to quit
this life, that’s the point; about beards here below I care little
or nothing; but without all these blandishments and prayers, I will beg my
master (for I know he loves me, and, besides, he has need of me just now
for a certain business) to help and aid your worship as far as he can;
unpack your woes and lay them before us, and leave us to deal with them,
for we’ll be all of one mind.”
</p>
<p>
The duke and duchess, as it was they who had made the experiment of this
adventure, were ready to burst with laughter at all this, and between
themselves they commended the clever acting of the Trifaldi, who,
returning to her seat, said, “Queen Doña Maguncia reigned over the
famous kingdom of Kandy, which lies between the great Trapobana and the
Southern Sea, two leagues beyond Cape Comorin. She was the widow of King
Archipiela, her lord and husband, and of their marriage they had issue the
Princess Antonomasia, heiress of the kingdom; which Princess Antonomasia
was reared and brought up under my care and direction, I being the oldest
