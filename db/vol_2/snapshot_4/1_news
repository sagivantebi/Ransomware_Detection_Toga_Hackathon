My friend bought a Siel DK80 synthesizer and now he is wondering how
the sequencer in that machine works.
 
 
Unfortunately we don't have any manuals for it.
 
Could somebody kindly send me information concerning this problem?
 
Thank you!

Hi there,

I'm actually working on C++ re-hacks of the X11 include files.
There are some problems with Xlib.h. In structures
Visual, XWindowAttributes and XColormapEvent there are variables named
``class'' and ``new'' which cause serious problems (C++ keywords) !

For the moment I've changed the names, but this is an awful hack. Does anybody
know a better solution ?

[If there's a Microport newsgroup, it doesn't come here]

				Background

AT&T's generic UNIX V.3 for the 80386 (as sold in binary form by AT&T,
Bell Technologies, Intel, Interactive Systems, Microport, Prime etc.)
will run binaries created for UNIX V.2 on the 80286.  A large number of
packages exists for AT&T's 6300 Plus, an 80286-based system running V.2.
These can be run on 80386-based systems while you're waiting for
software authors to come up with native 80386 ports of their products.

				Problem

You are supposed to load packages onto your 6300 Plus using the system's
administration procedures.  These handle weird multi-volume cpio diskette
sets, which are a pig to load unless you have the installation software.
Which you don't if you're trying to load the software onto an 80386-based
system running 386/ix, Microport, or whatever.

				Solution

Here's a shell script which does the job.  If you want to know the details,
it reads 350k, starting at offset 9k, from each 360k diskette in the
installation set, piping the result into cpio -c.  It the fires off the
Install program which should be part of the application package.  As the
comments remark, there's not a lot of error checking, as it's essentially
a quick hack.  Also, testing is about at the ``worked twice in a row''
level.  Despite all that, I hope it's useful to somebody out there.

It has already been done.  The program should be in /usr/demo/SRC/shaded.c,
the shuttle data is in /usr/demo/DATA/space.dat.  There are notes on running
it in /usr/demo/README.  The program displays 2 windows with cursor lines, to
enable you to select the 3d viewpoint, and there's a pop-up menu for setting
fill style and colour, &c.  For monochrome you need to select the "edges" (I
think) fill style or it'll look pretty wierd.  Also, if your display surface
doesn't support hidden surface removal, you'll get a wireframe effect that
can be confusing to the eye.

/usr/demo/DATA also contains data files for an icosahedron, a pyramid, a
ball and a Klein bottle.

I find this statement hard to believe, based on the quality
of his book "Circumpolar". It is full of characters which
barely qualify as two dimensional, offensive racial stereotypes
and various other assorted characters whose collective IQ doesn't get
into double figures. I rated this book as -****.

I cannot believe that someone who turned out such complete

I am however, willing to be surprised. What other books of

/.. of course!!

If you add directories above root (and remember that with the Newcastle
Connection, /.. was just a directory rather than some mysterious 
"super-root") so that it is possible for your current directory to
be in an uncle or cousin relationship with root (rather than a direct
descendent), then you have to modify the pwd algorithm accordingly.

pwd assumes that if you go up the tree with ".." enough times you will
get to root. If your current directory is in a sideways relationship
to root, this assumption will no longer be valid.

The modified pwd algorithm should work like this:

(1) Go up the tree with .. from your current directory until you
find / or reach the base of the tree (a directory which is its own
parent).

(2) If you didn't reach / in (1), then starting from / go up to
the base of the tree with .. and prefix the appropriate number of
/..'s to the string from (1).

For example, after cd /../../C/D, step (1) will give /C/D and step (2)
will give /../.. so the answer is /../../C/D.

This is relatively straightforward to implement. I've made the necessary
modifications to the System V /bin/pwd and sh (which has a built-in pwd)
for use with a kernel implementation of the Newcastle Connection.

The tricky bit is getting the shortest possible pathname. For example,
if / corresponds to /../../A/B in the global naming tree, then after
cd /../C, the modified pwd algorithm would give /../../A/C which is
correct but redundant. (/../../A is the same as /.. if / is /../../A/B).

This can be fixed if you keep a record of everywhere you visit in (1) and
stop in (2) when you reach somewhere you've visited before, but since in
an infinite naming tree this would require an infinite amount of storage
and isn't very efficient in any case, it is easier to simply implement
the algorithm given (which also requires an infinite amount of storage
in the general case of course!) and ignore this problem.

Does anyone have any recommendations for and/or experience of hard disk
optimisers for the ST?

The only ones I have come across are Simon Poole's DLII and Michtron's
Tune Up! (their exclamation mark, not mine).

I have tried neither (DLII did some strange things with a ram disk I 
tested it on, and I'd rather not pay for Tune Up! until I have some
favorable reports on it) and would be very interested in  anyone's
experiences with the above or any other such beasts.

Thanks.

The observer, if he waited around long enough, would also
see the black hole evaporate by Hawkins' radiation.

But, from the point of view of the observer, the "poor fellow"
can never cross the event horizon before the hole evaporates
away from under him.

Therefore, the "poor fellow" must observe one of two things.
Either he crosses the event horizon in a finite amount of
time, or he will observe the black hole to vanish as he
approaches.

1. sets up a paradox, but 2. implies that anything falling
into a black hole can't get into the black hole before it
evaporates. i.e. the black hole can't form in the first
place. It just get very close to it.

Who we are and what we do:

As a company, we produce  custom  solutions  on  hand-held  and portable
equipment,  primarily   customising   Hewlett-Packard   hand-helds.  For
example, we recently installed almost 6 000 HP-71 hand-held computers as
networked  terminals in 430 DHSS offices as part of a Document  Tracking
System developed by us to a DHSS specification.

We're not just a software  house, but also develop custom  packaging and
electronics where necessary too.  Our customers are primarily government
departments  (here and abroad), but we have also  produced  products for
individual sale through dealers (such as the Zenwand-71 barcode wand for
the HP-71, which span off of the DHSS contract).

Although our products are almost exclusively  related to hand-helds, our
expertise  stretches through to custom chip design and  mainframe-hosted
software  packages  (mainly  under Unix).  As a  consequence,  we regard
ourselves as a solutions  house, rather than being specific to software,
hardware, design or whatever.

We have one  office [in  Leeds],  have been  around for seven  years and
employ over 40 people at present.  Is that a reasonable summary?

I may have missed some of this thread, but I haven't heard anyone mention
Satie yet. His Vexations for piano is meant to be repeated 840 times
(it takes about 18 hours to perform). He also wrote some pieces of music
to be played in particular spaces - "Music for a Boardroom" is one

Our System Manager has reported that there is a problem with using EMULEX CS02
QBUS comms cards which are not at the latest revision level, under VMS 4.6.   
These cards appeared to work fine under VMS 4.5 and earlier.

The EMULEX CS02 card, configured as two DHV-11 8-line muxs, gives phantom
devices when running SHOW DEVICE.   For example, TXC0 to TXC7 become TXC0 to
TXC15.  There are problems in using the lines - for example Control-Y acts
on the group of lines not just one!  There are other problems known to EMULEX. 

The solution is to upgrade the firmware PROM on the card to at least
revision P.  Emulex may make a charge for this.

I am just preparing a 'semi-popular' lecture on how the
value of the Hubble Constant is determined.

As is generally
known, the values of different authors fluctuates between
ca. 50 to 100 km/(sec Mpc). The latest discussion of this
problem which I know of is M. Rowan-Robinson's book
"The Cosmological Distance Ladder" (Freeman 1985). He
advocates 67 km/(sec Mpc) after a detailed discussion of
the different distance indicators.

Now I would like to know: What is the current state of
affairs? The responses of the advocates of the various
values, for example by Sandage & Tammann or de Vaucouleurs
(= the grand old men of this topic)? Somehow I missed
their reactions. Can anybody give me a hint via e-mail?
I'll summarize.

Here is something which should do part of what you want. It doesn't
accomplish to start a new emacs process if you exited the last one
with C-x C-c - unless the first one had never been suspended!
Whenever you get "fg: No such job" just type ``i!!'', reinvoking the
commandline prefixed with an "i", "iemacs" standing for "init emacs".

alias emacs iemacs
alias iemacs 'alias emacs remacs; "emacs" \!* ; alias emacs iemacs'
alias remacs fg %emacs

Here we use a special version of suspend-emacs, that will look for a
file ".emacs_pause" in the user's home directory when emacs is
resumed. In this file suspend-emacs expects to find the current
working directory and an optional "command line" that is parsed like
the initial command line.  Very useful!
This could be done using "suspend-resume-hook", but the hook wasn't
available in 17.?? when this was first implemented here.

These are the aliases I use together with the special version of
suspend-emacs.

alias emacs iemacs
alias remacs 'echo `pwd` \!* >\! ~/.emacs_pause ; %emacs'
alias iemacs 'alias emacs remacs; "emacs" \!* ; alias emacs iemacs'
alias kemacs 'alias emacs iemacs; remacs -kill'

Could anyone please shed light on a problem I have in compiling the S
statistical package from AT&T on our Sun-3 system:

System specifics: Sun 3/260 under SunOS 3.4 using the m4 macro
processor supplied with the S system. S version date: Fri Feb 28 1986

Using the hints on compiling with BSD4.2 systems I only get apparently
harmless warnings under the compilation. This could for example be:

Warning on line 84 of hcp.f: local variable i never used
Warning on line 96 of stems.f: statement cannot be reached
f77: Warning: File with unknown suffix (/usr/local/src/s/S/newfun/lib/grz)
     passed to ld
or
"dprint.c", line 20: warning: illegal combination of pointer and integer, op =

Furthermore there are problems with the utility routine scandata.C, which
fails with error: too many local variables. This is fixed by making the
declaration of "table" global. Not pretty, but it works.

These are all the kinds of problems that appear during the
compilation, and it *will* result in an executable, except....
The f...ing system doesn't even know how to add two numbers, as seen in
the following:

One-time initialization for new S user in /usr.MC68020/iesd/tap/jpc ...
Directories swork and sdata created
> 1 + 2
Bad operator: +
Error in +
> 

Running the tests supplied with the system ($A/DOTEST ALL) will not
give better results. This is an excerpt from $TEST/current/apply:

> prefix("apply.")    # test of apply and multivariate stuff, some time-series
> $Random.seed_c(57,0,3,0,0,0,49,16,0,0,0,0)	# to initialize at same spot
> matr_matrix(rnorm(100),20,5)
Invalid distribution: rnorm
Error in rnorm
Dumped
> print(cm_apply(matr,2,"mean")); apply(matr,2,"var")
apply.matr not found
Dumped
 .
 .
and more depressing errors...
Why does the prefix command work, while the matr_matrix(rnorm... stuff don't?

So, have *anybody* made this run on a Sun system, and how did you do it?
All suggestions or pointers to which direction I should go, are welcome.

I experimented with offscreen pixmaps today. It seems that Color
Quickdraw is very flexible, but too slow for good animation. Most of the
overhead comes from color matching and conversion. I guess I could write
my own color matching routine, but I think there should be a fast way to
do a simple copy operation.

In most painting programs the actual painting could be done on an
offscreen bitmap with the same color table as the best gDevice.

It takes about twice as much time to do a copybits in srcCopy mode than
it takes in the srcXor mode. Below is a short program that draws to an
offscreen pixmap and then copies it back to the screen. Try different
transfer modes and note the speed difference. The code is written in LS
C 2.13. Even srcXor, which is the fastest usable mode, is too slow for
really high quality animation.

How can it be done faster?

#include <MacTypes.h>
#include <QuickDraw.h>
#include <Color.h>
#include <WindowMgr.h>

WindowPtr	onScreen;
CGrafPtr	offS;

	HLock(offS->portPixMap);
	offP=*(offS->portPixMap);

	SetRect(&offP->bounds,0,0,256,256);

I have an A2090 card and a CSA68020/68881 board with no 32 bit ram.
 
 They will Not work together. (but both work seperately)

I think the driver (hddisk) is dated  1986 , is this the latest driver?
(If not could you please e-mail me the latest version)

The problem is when I run binddrivers that task stops, (binddrivers
never exits). It seems to fallover on a particular call to execbase.
The last instruction (displayed by MetaScope) is  mov a2,(a0)

If i move the hddisk from expansion draw , to hddisk.device in the
devs draw, i can mount the harddisk (dh0:) , but when i do a
cd dh0: , the cd command displays 'Cant find dh0:'

I am running morerows, 672*266 on a B2000 rev 4.0 board (pal) with
2Mbytes expansion ram , 2*3.5inch drives, and (hopefully) A2090 +
20 Mbyte hard disk, and a CSA 68020/68881 board.

I have also done the wire-link modification to the main B2000 board,
as required by CSA for the 68020 board on Rev4.0 and later boards.

Slots are as follows :-

     I  I  E  E  E  M  H     6
     B  B  M  M  M  E  A     8
     M  M  P  P  P  M  R     0

Here's a suggestion for an improvement (at least I think it is :-) to the
"pickup" option in nethack, which someone who is familiar with the source
code might like to implement -

Make the "pickup" option a composite option like "packorder", and re-write
the picking up code so that the types of objects specified will be
automatically picked up. All other objects could still be picked up by ','.

e.g. "pickup:?+/=!)"  would pick up scrolls, spellbooks, wands, rings,
                                   potions, and weapons.

This would be useful for those of us who don't like carrying hoards of
gold around, and also to prevent picking up dead cockatrices while still
picking up other objects.

BTW, does anyone know what the options "null" and "news" do?

This still has the same problem as with "errno"- namely that you're trying
to describe a general ``error condition'' using a single number! I'm told
that VMS (but it's a good idea for all that...) provides a stack of error 
values which allows a program to search backward to find out what the "real" 
error was, depending on what kind of detail is required. If you have several
levels of library calls between you and the system call that failed, this
can be extremely useful- it's not really much use having an error-value
if you can't even tell what system call it came from (let alone what parameters
were *passed* to that system call to cause it to fail!).

A *decent* error-returning mechanism would describe:

	1. What call (syscall or library call) failed.
	   This could be a number- you could use something like internet
	   addressing to put some kind of structure into it:
		libc.stdio.fopen
	2. Why it failed.
	   Simple E-numbers will do for this (although I suppose they'd
	   have to be grouped for different libraries):
		E_STDIO.E_CANNOT_OPEN_FILE
	3. What value it returned.
		(FILE *)NULL
	3. What parameters were passed to it.
	   This is the most difficult one, because it would have to have
	   some kind of idea as to the types involved. It could (I suppose)
	   deal only with string types (and convert any other type into
	   "printable" form by doing the equivalent of sprintf()'ing it).
	   It also has to be a "list", which means it would probably have
	   to be done using something like "argc,argv":
		argc: 2
		argv: "mumble.splat", "r"

If the error is not "dealt with", then this information should propogate
down (together with the info from the callee's failure), and so on...

So, If you do a
	fopen("mumble.splat","r")
and it fails, then the following would be left on the stack (in some format
or other) to be dealt with by some error-diagnosing function:

	kernel.open:
		param 1: "mumble.splat" [string]
		param 2: 0 [int]
		returns: -1 [int]
		error: E_KERNEL.ENOENT
	libc.stdio.fopen:
		param 1: "mumble.splat" [string]
		param 2: "r" [string]
		returns: 0 [FILE *]
		error: E_LIBC.E_STDIO.E_CANNOT_OPEN_FILE

The error-diagnosing stuff could then print something *useful* such as
	stdio fopen: couldn't open file "mumble.splat" for reading, because:
	    kernel open: no file or directory "mumble.splat"

(and of course the format of these messages could be user-configurable, so
that noddies would just get the information they need, whereas people who
understand what they're doing could get reams and reams of info- just by setting
some environment parameter to the appropriate value).

Of course, all this stuff would have to be known by the compiler, and I'm sure
it'd be dead slow to execute!

A local group is going to start a diplomacy game by mail. We have
only few players so I would like to take part in the game myself.
To do so, I would like to have the moves evaluated by a
program. Before writing such a program myself, I would like to
ask if anyone has or knows of such a program in the public
domain, preferrably written in C. Code or pointers to it will be
greatly appreciated.

This strikes me as quite odd.  I mean, if something can be done in two lifetimes
then, darn it, it is well within my imagination.
If it can be done within 20 lifetimes
I can still grasp how difficult it should be.  A real difficult thing would
be something that takes say 10^100 lifetimes.

In short, I find the above ad quite naive.  NSA guys should probably
have something better than this for the inspring encryption student.
What do you say?

This is really dangerous programming. The points where the left and where the
right "bar" are evaluated are implementation defined. The problem is similar to
another one, which a friend of mine had some time ago. He tried to pack as much
as possible into the control part of a while loop using the following statement:

while (a[i]=b[i++])
  ;

Things were even worse here, as the program behaved even differently depending
on whether it was compiled with the optimization option or not. Non optimized
everything worked as expected but in the optimized version only for the first
assignment "i" was incremented after the assignment, for all the following
assignments it was incremented after the evaluation of "b[i]" but before the 
assignment. Nevertheless this behaviour was in the sense of both K&R and ANSI.
The only thing you can trust on, is that the *operand* of the increment
operator is evaluated before its incrementation. One way to achieve the desired
behaviour is, as you suggested yourself, to write:

> What he really wanted was the equivalent of
> 	bar->tmp = bar;
> 	bar++;

and not (for the same reasons stated above):

> 	(bar++)->tmp = bar;

If there is any necessity to have the whole semantic in one *expression*, use
the comma operator, as

bar->tmp = bar, bar++;

This operator *guarantees* the sequential evaluation of its operands from
left to right.

For people interested, here are a couple of bugs in the Alcyon
compiler that we've been hitting our heads against for the last few
weeks:

	1) The compiler doesn't seem able to cope with nested
	   initialisations. For instance, a struct with an array in
	   the middle:
		static struct foo table[] = {
			{ ...... {.....} ......},
			...
		}
	   The compiler complains about mismatched braces.
	   Cure: 'unwrap' the struct declaration, so it's all at the
		 same level.

	2) In a construct like
		bar *p = (expression1, expression2);
	   the result of expression2 gets coerced to int, and then
	   back to bar *, meaning basically that you get bombs on the
	   screen when you try to use p, due to a wrong address.
	   Cure: use
		bar *p = (expression1, (bar *) expression2);

	3) We believe that 'complicated' initialisations to auto
	   variables in functions (for instance where the
	   initialisation involves a call to another function) often
	   come out wrong. However, by this point, we despaired, and
	   stopped using the compiler, so we never followed up on it.

I might point out that we're trying to compile a BIG program: 30,000
lines of C, so just trying to trace bug 2 took us a LOT of time.

By the way, just for interest: to compile the lot from scratch, using
a ram disk for temporaries would take 4 hours. When we reinitialised
the disk partition, and copied the files back, a recompile only took
1.5 hours!

I once implemented a syslogd for HP-UX using message queues. I have posted
it to comp.sources.unix some time ago, but I can mail it if you cannot find
it.

Features: (almost) BSD compatible, no network support, runs as a daemon,
communicates with message queues.
If no daemon is running, calling 'syslog' is effectivily a no-op.
I have used it when I tried to get sendmail running.

When I purchased VersaTerm 2+ years ago I didn't bother to register.
Now I wish I had. It's about time for an update.

The manual lists the address:
Peripherals Computers & Supplies Inc
2232 Perkiomen Avenue
Mt. Penn, PA 19606

Is this still current (other VersaTerm Users)?

In either case, an e-mail reply will be appreciated.
The dealer (I bought it from) here is still selling
the same version of two years ago. (1.42)

I have written a program to recursively compare the contents of two given
directories, file for file.  The program descends the tree and reports about
files that are missing or different.  Some day, if I ever get around to
producing V1.3 of MINIX, I will make a tree of the current version next to
the V1.2 tree, and then run this program to get a list of all files that
are different.  Then I can make diff listings etc.  In reality, the reason
I wrote it however, is that I had just copied my MINIX tree from one part
of the disk to another, and I wanted to make sure nothing was forgotten.
I am sure there are other uses as well.    One could no doubt write a shell
script to do this same thing, or perhaps use find, but this program is
much faster, being able to compare two 8 megabyte trees in about 12
minutes on a Z-248.

Please post any bugs you find.

1) We want to connect a laserprinter for use with troff
on a NCR Tower System. Has anyone experience with this?

2) We will have access to a KYOCERA F-1000 or F-1200 laser printer.
Does anyone know about the existence of a filter for the
troff output to the laserprinter (which uses 'Prescribe').

3) This laserprinter also has an HP Laserjet Plus emulation.
Another solution would then be to use a troff output filter
for the HP Laserjet.  So I will ask the same question
about the existence for this filter.

Please mail responses directly to me. If there are usefull
responses, I will post a summary to the net.

Well, you can do that by making each such pipeline belong to it's own SXT
device, and have all these SXT's multiplexed onto your *real* terminal.
Instant job-control!

BTW, SVR2 (and 3?) setpgrp() doesn't fully detach a process from its 
controlling tty if this process has already done a setpgrp() previously
(as is the case for a login-shell -- this comes from init and getty).
What it does in this case is to "partially" detach -- so that if you try 
to set up a new controlling terminal, it's not actually a controlling terminal 
at all -- things like terminal-generated signals don't get sent to the process.
Presumably this is just a cretinous bug, and not something more sophisticated.

In the book of the film, Valkris was definitely a Klingon, out to do something
valiant to redeem her family's honour. She became very friendly with another
alien on board that ship because of that alien's warrior traditions.

Any character may learn the Force skills from a master, and the rulebook even
encourages players using the Jedi characters to do some teaching, provided that
the pupil hasn't got any Dark Side points. Remember, Luke Skywalker was a
"Brash Pilot" type until Obi-Wan (OB1? :-) got to him.

Now for my question. There are some really nice pictures in the rulebook. Can I
get separate copies of these? They would be great posters, especially the
Imperial Navy recruiting poster and the R2 advert.

Sorry, there was only ever one original Max Headroom
programme. That was a one-off TV film made by the BBC.
Any episodes beyond the original story did not originate
with the BBC, although Maxs' creators may have been involved.

Max then re-appeared on Channel 4 as host of a chat show for two
short seasons. (interviewing guest stars about their views
on Golf, music, life and, most importantly, Golf :->)

He then crossed the atlantic to be re-made by ABC.

If you can persuade cfront to finish in less than a second with the
+S option on, then the calculation of the number of lines processed
per second generates a divide-by-zero! On a SUN-3 with 1.2.1,
typing
        cfront +S </dev/null
will demonstrate the problem.

Fix main.c thus:

		fprintf(stderr,"real time delay %ld: %d lines per second\n",
#ifdef	CFRONTTOOFASTFIX
			stop_time-start_time,
			stop_time-start_time > 0 ?
				Nline/(stop_time-start_time) : Nline);

Egg released at least one other album before `Civil Surface', I think it
was called `the Polite Force'.  They were very good.

Their drummer (Clive Brooks?) joined the Groundhogs.
Their bassist (Mont Campbell?) played sometimes with some of the other
  Canterbury scene people: National Health, U.K. or similar (mid 70's).
Their organist, Dave Stewart, became a pop star (`
