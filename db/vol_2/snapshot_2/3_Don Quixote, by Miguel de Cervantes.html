“Have not your worships,” replied Don Quixote, “read the annals and
histories of England, in which are recorded the famous deeds of King
Arthur, whom we in our popular Castilian invariably call King Artus, with
regard to whom it is an ancient tradition, and commonly received all over
that kingdom of Great Britain, that this king did not die, but was changed
by magic art into a raven, and that in process of time he is to return to
reign and recover his kingdom and sceptre; for which reason it cannot be
proved that from that time to this any Englishman ever killed a raven?
Well, then, in the time of this good king that famous order of chivalry of
the Knights of the Round Table was instituted, and the amour of Don
Lancelot of the Lake with the Queen Guinevere occurred, precisely as is
there related, the go-between and confidante therein being the highly
honourable dame Quintañona, whence came that ballad so well known and
widely spread in our Spain—
</p>
<p class="poem">
O never surely was there knight<br>
    So served by hand of dame,<br>
As served was he Sir Lancelot hight<br>
    When he from Britain came—
</p>
<p class="noindent">
with all the sweet and delectable course of his achievements in love and
war. Handed down from that time, then, this order of chivalry went on
extending and spreading itself over many and various parts of the world;
and in it, famous and renowned for their deeds, were the mighty Amadis of
Gaul with all his sons and descendants to the fifth generation, and the
valiant Felixmarte of Hircania, and the never sufficiently praised Tirante
el Blanco, and in our own days almost we have seen and heard and talked
with the invincible knight Don Belianis of Greece. This, then, sirs, is to
be a knight-errant, and what I have spoken of is the order of his
chivalry, of which, as I have already said, I, though a sinner, have made
profession, and what the aforesaid knights professed that same do I
profess, and so I go through these solitudes and wilds seeking adventures,
resolved in soul to oppose my arm and person to the most perilous that
fortune may offer me in aid of the weak and needy.”
</p>
<p>
By these words of his the travellers were able to satisfy themselves of
Don Quixote’s being out of his senses and of the form of madness that
overmastered him, at which they felt the same astonishment that all felt
on first becoming acquainted with it; and Vivaldo, who was a person of
great shrewdness and of a lively temperament, in order to beguile the
short journey which they said was required to reach the mountain, the
scene of the burial, sought to give him an opportunity of going on with
his absurdities. So he said to him, “It seems to me, Señor Knight-errant,
that your worship has made choice of one of the most austere professions
in the world, and I imagine even that of the Carthusian monks is not so
austere.”
</p>
<p>
“As austere it may perhaps be,” replied our Don Quixote, “but so necessary
for the world I am very much inclined to doubt. For, if the truth is to be
told, the soldier who executes what his captain orders does no less than
the captain himself who gives the order. My meaning, is, that churchmen in
peace and quiet pray to Heaven for the welfare of the world, but we
soldiers and knights carry into effect what they pray for, defending it
with the might of our arms and the edge of our swords, not under shelter
but in the open air, a target for the intolerable rays of the sun in
summer and the piercing frosts of winter. Thus are we God’s ministers on
earth and the arms by which his justice is done therein. And as the
business of war and all that relates and belongs to it cannot be conducted
without exceeding great sweat, toil, and exertion, it follows that those
who make it their profession have undoubtedly more labour than those who
in tranquil peace and quiet are engaged in praying to God to help the
weak. I do not mean to say, nor does it enter into my thoughts, that the
knight-errant’s calling is as good as that of the monk in his cell; I
would merely infer from what I endure myself that it is beyond a doubt a
more laborious and a more belaboured one, a hungrier and thirstier, a
wretcheder, raggeder, and lousier; for there is no reason to doubt that
the knights-errant of yore endured much hardship in the course of their
lives. And if some of them by the might of their arms did rise to be
emperors, in faith it cost them dear in the matter of blood and sweat; and
if those who attained to that rank had not had magicians and sages to help
them they would have been completely baulked in their ambition and
disappointed in their hopes.”
</p>
<p>
“That is my own opinion,” replied the traveller; “but one thing among many
others seems to me very wrong in knights-errant, and that is that when
they find themselves about to engage in some mighty and perilous adventure
in which there is manifest danger of losing their lives, they never at the
moment of engaging in it think of commending themselves to God, as is the
duty of every good Christian in like peril; instead of which they commend
themselves to their ladies with as much devotion as if these were their
gods, a thing which seems to me to savour somewhat of heathenism.”
</p>
<p>
“Sir,” answered Don Quixote, “that cannot be on any account omitted, and
the knight-errant would be disgraced who acted otherwise: for it is usual
and customary in knight-errantry that the knight-errant, who on engaging
in any great feat of arms has his lady before him, should turn his eyes
towards her softly and lovingly, as though with them entreating her to
favour and protect him in the hazardous venture he is about to undertake,
and even though no one hear him, he is bound to say certain words between
his teeth, commending himself to her with all his heart, and of this we
have innumerable instances in the histories. Nor is it to be supposed from
this that they are to omit commending themselves to God, for there will be
time and opportunity for doing so while they are engaged in their task.”
</p>
<p>
“For all that,” answered the traveller, “I feel some doubt still, because
often I have read how words will arise between two knights-errant, and
from one thing to another it comes about that their anger kindles and they
wheel their horses round and take a good stretch of field, and then
without any more ado at the top of their speed they come to the charge,
and in mid-career they are wont to commend themselves to their ladies; and
what commonly comes of the encounter is that one falls over the haunches
of his horse pierced through and through by his antagonist’s lance, and as
for the other, it is only by holding on to the mane of his horse that he
can help falling to the ground; but I know not how the dead man had time
to commend himself to God in the course of such rapid work as this; it
would have been better if those words which he spent in commending himself
to his lady in the midst of his career had been devoted to his duty and
obligation as a Christian. Moreover, it is my belief that all
knights-errant have not ladies to commend themselves to, for they are not
all in love.”
</p>
<p>
“That is impossible,” said Don Quixote: “I say it is impossible that there
could be a knight-errant without a lady, because to such it is as natural
and proper to be in love as to the heavens to have stars: most certainly
no history has been seen in which there is to be found a knight-errant
without an amour, and for the simple reason that without one he would be
held no legitimate knight but a bastard, and one who had gained entrance
into the stronghold of the said knighthood, not by the door, but over the
wall like a thief and a robber.”
</p>
<p>
“Nevertheless,” said the traveller, “if I remember rightly, I think I have
read that Don Galaor, the brother of the valiant Amadis of Gaul, never had
any special lady to whom he might commend himself, and yet he was not the
less esteemed, and was a very stout and famous knight.”
</p>
<p>
To which our Don Quixote made answer, “Sir, one solitary swallow does not
make summer; moreover, I know that knight was in secret very deeply in
love; besides which, that way of falling in love with all that took his
fancy was a natural propensity which he could not control. But, in short,
it is very manifest that he had one alone whom he made mistress of his
will, to whom he commended himself very frequently and very secretly, for
he prided himself on being a reticent knight.”
</p>
<p>
“Then if it be essential that every knight-errant should be in love,” said
the traveller, “it may be fairly supposed that your worship is so, as you
are of the order; and if you do not pride yourself on being as reticent as
Don Galaor, I entreat you as earnestly as I can, in the name of all this
company and in my own, to inform us of the name, country, rank, and beauty
of your lady, for she will esteem herself fortunate if all the world knows
that she is loved and served by such a knight as your worship seems to
be.”
</p>
<p>
At this Don Quixote heaved a deep sigh and said, “I cannot say positively
whether my sweet enemy is pleased or not that the world should know I
serve her; I can only say in answer to what has been so courteously asked
of me, that her name is Dulcinea, her country El Toboso, a village of La
Mancha, her rank must be at least that of a princess, since she is my
queen and lady, and her beauty superhuman, since all the impossible and
fanciful attributes of beauty which the poets apply to their ladies are
verified in her; for her hairs are gold, her forehead Elysian fields, her
eyebrows rainbows, her eyes suns, her cheeks roses, her lips coral, her
teeth pearls, her neck alabaster, her bosom marble, her hands ivory, her
fairness snow, and what modesty conceals from sight such, I think and
imagine, as rational reflection can only extol, not compare.”
</p>
<p>
“We should like to know her lineage, race, and ancestry,” said Vivaldo.
</p>
<p>
To which Don Quixote replied, “She is not of the ancient Roman Curtii,
Caii, or Scipios, nor of the modern Colonnas or Orsini, nor of the
Moncadas or Requesenes of Catalonia, nor yet of the Rebellas or Villanovas
of Valencia; Palafoxes, Nuzas, Rocabertis, Corellas, Lunas, Alagones,
Urreas, Foces, or Gurreas of Aragon; Cerdas, Manriques, Mendozas, or
Guzmans of Castile; Alencastros, Pallas, or Meneses of Portugal; but she
is of those of El Toboso of La Mancha, a lineage that though modern, may
furnish a source of gentle blood for the most illustrious families of the
ages that are to come, and this let none dispute with me save on the
condition that Zerbino placed at the foot of the trophy of Orlando’s arms,
saying,
</p>
<p class="poem">
These let none move<br>
Who dareth not his might with Roland prove.”
</p>
<p>
“Although mine is of the Cachopins of Laredo,” said the traveller, “I will
not venture to compare it with that of El Toboso of La Mancha, though, to
tell the truth, no such surname has until now ever reached my ears.”
</p>
<p>
“What!” said Don Quixote, “has that never reached them?”
</p>
<p>
The rest of the party went along listening with great attention to the
conversation of the pair, and even the very goatherds and shepherds
perceived how exceedingly out of his wits our Don Quixote was. Sancho
Panza alone thought that what his master said was the truth, knowing who
he was and having known him from his birth; and all that he felt any
difficulty in believing was that about the fair Dulcinea del Toboso,
because neither any such name nor any such princess had ever come to his
knowledge though he lived so close to El Toboso. They were going along
conversing in this way, when they saw descending a gap between two high
mountains some twenty shepherds, all clad in sheepskins of black wool, and
crowned with garlands which, as afterwards appeared, were, some of them of
yew, some of cypress. Six of the number were carrying a bier covered with
a great variety of flowers and branches, on seeing which one of the
goatherds said, “Those who come there are the bearers of Chrysostom’s
body, and the foot of that mountain is the place where he ordered them to
bury him.” They therefore made haste to reach the spot, and did so by the
time those who came had laid the bier upon the ground, and four of them
with sharp pickaxes were digging a grave by the side of a hard rock. They
greeted each other courteously, and then Don Quixote and those who
accompanied him turned to examine the bier, and on it, covered with
flowers, they saw a dead body in the dress of a shepherd, to all
appearance of one thirty years of age, and showing even in death that in
life he had been of comely features and gallant bearing. Around him on the
bier itself were laid some books, and several papers open and folded; and
Racked by suspicion as by certainty;<br>
those who were looking on as well as those who were opening the grave and
all the others who were there preserved a strange silence, until one of
those who had borne the body said to another, “Observe carefully, Ambrosio
if this is the place Chrysostom spoke of, since you are anxious that what
he directed in his will should be so strictly complied with.”
</p>
<p>
“This is the place,” answered Ambrosio “for in it many a time did my poor
friend tell me the story of his hard fortune. Here it was, he told me,
that he saw for the first time that mortal enemy of the human race, and
here, too, for the first time he declared to her his passion, as
honourable as it was devoted, and here it was that at last Marcela ended
by scorning and rejecting him so as to bring the tragedy of his wretched
life to a close; here, in memory of misfortunes so great, he desired to be
laid in the bowels of eternal oblivion.” Then turning to Don Quixote and
the travellers he went on to say, “That body, sirs, on which you are
looking with compassionate eyes, was the abode of a soul on which Heaven
bestowed a vast share of its riches. That is the body of Chrysostom, who
was unrivalled in wit, unequalled in courtesy, unapproached in gentle
bearing, a phœnix in friendship, generous without limit, grave without
arrogance, gay without vulgarity, and, in short, first in all that
constitutes goodness and second to none in all that makes up misfortune.
He loved deeply, he was hated; he adored, he was scorned; he wooed a wild
beast, he pleaded with marble, he pursued the wind, he cried to the
wilderness, he served ingratitude, and for reward was made the prey of
death in the mid-course of life, cut short by a shepherdess whom he sought
to immortalise in the memory of man, as these papers which you see could
fully prove, had he not commanded me to consign them to the fire after
having consigned his body to the earth.”
</p>
<p>
“You would deal with them more harshly and cruelly than their owner
himself,” said Vivaldo, “for it is neither right nor proper to do the will
of one who enjoins what is wholly unreasonable; it would not have been
reasonable in Augustus Cæsar had he permitted the directions left by the
divine Mantuan in his will to be carried into effect. So that, Señor
Ambrosio while you consign your friend’s body to the earth, you should not
consign his writings to oblivion, for if he gave the order in bitterness
of heart, it is not right that you should irrationally obey it. On the
contrary, by granting life to those papers, let the cruelty of Marcela
live for ever, to serve as a warning in ages to come to all men to shun
and avoid falling into like danger; or I and all of us who have come here
know already the story of this your love-stricken and heart-broken friend,
and we know, too, your friendship, and the cause of his death, and the
directions he gave at the close of his life; from which sad story may be
gathered how great was the cruelty of Marcela, the love of Chrysostom, and
the loyalty of your friendship, together with the end awaiting those who
pursue rashly the path that insane passion opens to their eyes. Last night
we learned the death of Chrysostom and that he was to be buried here, and
out of curiosity and pity we left our direct road and resolved to come and
see with our eyes that which when heard of had so moved our compassion,
and in consideration of that compassion and our desire to prove it if we
might by condolence, we beg of you, excellent Ambrosio, or at least I on
my own account entreat you, that instead of burning those papers you allow
me to carry away some of them.”
</p>
<p>
And without waiting for the shepherd’s answer, he stretched out his hand
and took up some of those that were nearest to him; seeing which Ambrosio
said, “Out of courtesy, señor, I will grant your request as to those you
have taken, but it is idle to expect me to abstain from burning the
remainder.”
</p>
<p>
Vivaldo, who was eager to see what the papers contained, opened one of
them at once, and saw that its title was “Lay of Despair.”
</p>
<p>
Ambrosio hearing it said, “That is the last paper the unhappy man wrote;
and that you may see, señor, to what an end his misfortunes brought him,
read it so that you may be heard, for you will have time enough for that
while we are waiting for the grave to be dug.”
</p>
<p>
“I will do so very willingly,” said Vivaldo; and as all the bystanders
were equally eager they gathered round him, and he, reading in a loud
voice, found that it ran as follows.

THE LAY OF CHRYSOSTOM<br>
<br>
Since thou dost in thy cruelty desire<br>
The ruthless rigour of thy tyranny<br>
From tongue to tongue, from land to land proclaimed,<br>
The very Hell will I constrain to lend<br>
This stricken breast of mine deep notes of woe<br>
To serve my need of fitting utterance.<br>
And as I strive to body forth the tale<br>
Of all I suffer, all that thou hast done,<br>
Forth shall the dread voice roll, and bear along<br>
Shreds from my vitals torn for greater pain.<br>
Then listen, not to dulcet harmony,<br>
But to a discord wrung by mad despair<br>
Out of this bosom’s depths of bitterness,<br>
To ease my heart and plant a sting in thine.<br>
<br>
The lion’s roar, the fierce wolf’s savage howl,<br>
The horrid hissing of the scaly snake,<br>
The awesome cries of monsters yet unnamed,<br>
The crow’s ill-boding croak, the hollow moan<br>
Of wild winds wrestling with the restless sea,<br>
The wrathful bellow of the vanquished bull,<br>
The plaintive sobbing of the widowed dove,<br>
The envied owl’s sad note, the wail of woe<br>
That rises from the dreary choir of Hell,<br>
Commingled in one sound, confusing sense,<br>
Let all these come to aid my soul’s complaint,<br>
For pain like mine demands new modes of song.<br>
<br>
No echoes of that discord shall be heard<br>
Where Father Tagus rolls, or on the banks<br>
Of olive-bordered Betis; to the rocks<br>
Or in deep caverns shall my plaint be told,<br>
And by a lifeless tongue in living words;<br>
Or in dark valleys or on lonely shores,<br>
Where neither foot of man nor sunbeam falls;<br>
Or in among the poison-breathing swarms<br>
Of monsters nourished by the sluggish Nile.<br>
For, though it be to solitudes remote<br>
The hoarse vague echoes of my sorrows sound<br>
Thy matchless cruelty, my dismal fate<br>
Shall carry them to all the spacious world.<br>
<br>
Disdain hath power to kill, and patience dies<br>
Slain by suspicion, be it false or true;<br>
And deadly is the force of jealousy;<br>
Long absence makes of life a dreary void;<br>
No hope of happiness can give repose<br>
To him that ever fears to be forgot;<br>
And death, inevitable, waits in hall.<br>
But I, by some strange miracle, live on<br>
A prey to absence, jealousy, disdain;<br>
Racked by suspicion as by certainty;<br>
Forgotten, left to feed my flame alone.<br>
And while I suffer thus, there comes no ray<br>
Of hope to gladden me athwart the gloom;<br>
Nor do I look for it in my despair;<br>
But rather clinging to a cureless woe,<br>
All hope do I abjure for evermore.<br>
<br>
Can there be hope where fear is? Were it well,<br>
When far more certain are the grounds of fear?<br>
Ought I to shut mine eyes to jealousy,<br>
If through a thousand heart-wounds it appears?<br>
Who would not give free access to distrust,<br>
Seeing disdain unveiled, and—bitter change!—<br>
All his suspicions turned to certainties,<br>
And the fair truth transformed into a lie?<br>
Oh, thou fierce tyrant of the realms of love,<br>
Oh, Jealousy! put chains upon these hands,<br>
And bind me with thy strongest cord, Disdain.<br>
But, woe is me! triumphant over all,<br>
My sufferings drown the memory of you.<br>
<br>
And now I die, and since there is no hope<br>
Of happiness for me in life or death,<br>
Still to my fantasy I’ll fondly cling.<br>
I’ll say that he is wise who loveth well,<br>
And that the soul most free is that most bound<br>
In thraldom to the ancient tyrant Love.<br>
I’ll say that she who is mine enemy<br>
In that fair body hath as fair a mind,<br>
And that her coldness is but my desert,<br>
And that by virtue of the pain he sends<br>
Love rules his kingdom with a gentle sway.<br>
Thus, self-deluding, and in bondage sore,<br>
And wearing out the wretched shred of life<br>
To which I am reduced by her disdain,<br>
I’ll give this soul and body to the winds,<br>
All hopeless of a crown of bliss in store.<br>
<br>
Thou whose injustice hath supplied the cause<br>
That makes me quit the weary life I loathe,<br>
As by this wounded bosom thou canst see<br>
How willingly thy victim I become,<br>
Let not my death, if haply worth a tear,<br>
Cloud the clear heaven that dwells in thy bright eyes;<br>
I would not have thee expiate in aught<br>
The crime of having made my heart thy prey;<br>
But rather let thy laughter gaily ring<br>
And prove my death to be thy festival.<br>
Fool that I am to bid thee! well I know<br>
Thy glory gains by my untimely end.<br>
<br>
And now it is the time; from Hell’s abyss<br>
Come thirsting Tantalus, come Sisyphus<br>
Heaving the cruel stone, come Tityus<br>
With vulture, and with wheel Ixion come,<br>
And come the sisters of the ceaseless toil;<br>
And all into this breast transfer their pains,<br>
And (if such tribute to despair be due)<br>
Chant in their deepest tones a doleful dirge<br>
Over a corse unworthy of a shroud.<br>
Let the three-headed guardian of the gate,<br>
And all the monstrous progeny of hell,<br>
The doleful concert join: a lover dead<br>
Methinks can have no fitter obsequies.<br>
<br>
breath, which no doubt smelt of yesterday’s stale salad, seemed to him to
Lay of despair, grieve not when thou art gone<br>
Forth from this sorrowing heart: my misery<br>
Brings fortune to the cause that gave thee birth;<br>
Then banish sadness even in the tomb.<br>
</p>
<p>
The “Lay of Chrysostom” met with the approbation of the listeners, though
the reader said it did not seem to him to agree with what he had heard of
Marcela’s reserve and propriety, for Chrysostom complained in it of
jealousy, suspicion, and absence, all to the prejudice of the good name
and fame of Marcela; to which Ambrosio replied as one who knew well his
friend’s most secret thoughts, “Señor, to remove that doubt I should tell
you that when the unhappy man wrote this lay he was away from Marcela,
from whom he had voluntarily separated himself, to try if absence would
act with him as it is wont; and as everything distresses and every fear
haunts the banished lover, so imaginary jealousies and suspicions, dreaded
as if they were true, tormented Chrysostom; and thus the truth of what
report declares of the virtue of Marcela remains unshaken, and with her
envy itself should not and cannot find any fault save that of being cruel,
somewhat haughty, and very scornful.”
</p>
<p>
“That is true,” said Vivaldo; and as he was about to read another paper of
those he had preserved from the fire, he was stopped by a marvellous
vision (for such it seemed) that unexpectedly presented itself to their
eyes; for on the summit of the rock where they were digging the grave
there appeared the shepherdess Marcela, so beautiful that her beauty
exceeded its reputation. Those who had never till then beheld her gazed
upon her in wonder and silence, and those who were accustomed to see her
were not less amazed than those who had never seen her before. But the
instant Ambrosio saw her he addressed her, with manifest indignation:
</p>
<p>
“Art thou come, by chance, cruel basilisk of these mountains, to see if in
thy presence blood will flow from the wounds of this wretched being thy
cruelty has robbed of life; or is it to exult over the cruel work of thy
humours that thou art come; or like another pitiless Nero to look down
from that height upon the ruin of his Rome in embers; or in thy arrogance
to trample on this ill-fated corpse, as the ungrateful daughter trampled
on her father Tarquin’s? Tell us quickly for what thou art come, or what
it is thou wouldst have, for, as I know the thoughts of Chrysostom never
failed to obey thee in life, I will make all these who call themselves his
friends obey thee, though he be dead.”
</p>
<p>
“I come not, Ambrosio for any of the purposes thou hast named,” replied
Marcela, “but to defend myself and to prove how unreasonable are all those
who blame me for their sorrow and for Chrysostom’s death; and therefore I
ask all of you that are here to give me your attention, for it will not take
much time or many words to bring the truth home to persons of sense.
Heaven has made me, so you say, beautiful, and so much so that in spite of
yourselves my beauty leads you to love me; and for the love you show me
you say, and even urge, that I am bound to love you. By that natural
understanding which God has given me I know that everything beautiful
attracts love, but I cannot see how, by reason of being loved, that which
is loved for its beauty is bound to love that which loves it; besides, it
may happen that the lover of that which is beautiful may be ugly, and
ugliness being detestable, it is very absurd to say, “I love thee because
thou art beautiful, thou must love me though I be ugly.” But supposing the
beauty equal on both sides, it does not follow that the inclinations must
be therefore alike, for it is not every beauty that excites love, some but
pleasing the eye without winning the affection; and if every sort of
beauty excited love and won the heart, the will would wander vaguely to
and fro unable to make choice of any; for as there is an infinity of
beautiful objects there must be an infinity of inclinations, and true
love, I have heard it said, is indivisible, and must be voluntary and not
compelled. If this be so, as I believe it to be, why do you desire me to
bend my will by force, for no other reason but that you say you love me?
Nay—tell me—had Heaven made me ugly, as it has made me
beautiful, could I with justice complain of you for not loving me?
Moreover, you must remember that the beauty I possess was no choice of
mine, for, be it what it may, Heaven of its bounty gave it me without my
asking or choosing it; and as the viper, though it kills with it, does not
deserve to be blamed for the poison it carries, as it is a gift of nature,
neither do I deserve reproach for being beautiful; for beauty in a modest
woman is like fire at a distance or a sharp sword; the one does not burn,
the other does not cut, those who do not come too near. Honour and virtue
are the ornaments of the mind, without which the body, though it be so,
has no right to pass for beautiful; but if modesty is one of the virtues
that specially lend a grace and charm to mind and body, why should she who
is loved for her beauty part with it to gratify one who for his pleasure
alone strives with all his might and energy to rob her of it? I was born
free, and that I might live in freedom I chose the solitude of the fields;
in the trees of the mountains I find society, the clear waters of the
brooks are my mirrors, and to the trees and waters I make known my
thoughts and charms. I am a fire afar off, a sword laid aside. Those whom
I have inspired with love by letting them see me, I have by words
undeceived, and if their longings live on hope—and I have given none
to Chrysostom or to any other—it cannot justly be said that the
death of any is my doing, for it was rather his own obstinacy than my
cruelty that killed him; and if it be made a charge against me that his
wishes were honourable, and that therefore I was bound to yield to them, I
answer that when on this very spot where now his grave is made he declared
to me his purity of purpose, I told him that mine was to live in perpetual
solitude, and that the earth alone should enjoy the fruits of my
retirement and the spoils of my beauty; and if, after this open avowal, he
chose to persist against hope and steer against the wind, what wonder is
it that he should sink in the depths of his infatuation? If I had
encouraged him, I should be false; if I had gratified him, I should have
acted against my own better resolution and purpose. He was persistent in
spite of warning, he despaired without being hated. Bethink you now if it
be reasonable that his suffering should be laid to my charge. Let him who
has been deceived complain, let him give way to despair whose encouraged
hopes have proved vain, let him flatter himself whom I shall entice, let
of whether all those stake-strokes were an indignity or not gives me no
him boast whom I shall receive; but let not him call me cruel or homicide
to whom I make no promise, upon whom I practise no deception, whom I
neither entice nor receive. It has not been so far the will of Heaven that
I should love by fate, and to expect me to love by choice is idle. Let
his abode on the Peña Pobre for—I know not if it was eight years or
this general declaration serve for each of my suitors on his own account,
and let it be understood from this time forth that if anyone dies for me
it is not of jealousy or misery he dies, for she who loves no one can give
no cause for jealousy to any, and candour is not to be confounded with
scorn. Let him who calls me wild beast and basilisk, leave me alone as
something noxious and evil; let him who calls me ungrateful, withhold his
service; who calls me wayward, seek not my acquaintance; who calls me
cruel, pursue me not; for this wild beast, this basilisk, this ungrateful,
cruel, wayward being has no kind of desire to seek, serve, know, or follow
them. If Chrysostom’s impatience and violent passion killed him, why
should my modest behaviour and circumspection be blamed? If I preserve my
purity in the society of the trees, why should he who would have me
preserve it among men, seek to rob me of it? I have, as you know, wealth
of my own, and I covet not that of others; my taste is for freedom, and I
have no relish for constraint; I neither love nor hate anyone; I do not
deceive this one or court that, or trifle with one or play with another.
The modest converse of the shepherd girls of these hamlets and the care of
my goats are my recreations; my desires are bounded by these mountains,
and if they ever wander hence it is to contemplate the beauty of the
heavens, steps by which the soul travels to its primeval abode.”
</p>
<p>
With these words, and not waiting to hear a reply, she turned and passed
into the thickest part of a wood that was hard by, leaving all who were
there lost in admiration as much of her good sense as of her beauty. Some—those
wounded by the irresistible shafts launched by her bright eyes—made
as though they would follow her, heedless of the frank declaration they
had heard; seeing which, and deeming this a fitting occasion for the
exercise of his chivalry in aid of distressed damsels, Don Quixote, laying
his hand on the hilt of his sword, exclaimed in a loud and distinct voice:
</p>
<p>
“Let no one, whatever his rank or condition, dare to follow the beautiful
Marcela, under pain of incurring my fierce indignation. She has shown by
clear and satisfactory arguments that little or no fault is to be found
with her for the death of Chrysostom, and also how far she is from
yielding to the wishes of any of her lovers, for which reason, instead of
being followed and persecuted, she should in justice be honoured and
esteemed by all the good people of the world, for she shows that she is
the only woman in it that holds to such a virtuous resolution.”
</p>
<p>
Whether it was because of the threats of Don Quixote, or because Ambrosio
told them to fulfil their duty to their good friend, none of the shepherds
moved or stirred from the spot until, having finished the grave and burned
Chrysostom’s papers, they laid his body in it, not without many tears from
those who stood by. They closed the grave with a heavy stone until a slab
was ready which Ambrosio said he meant to have prepared, with an epitaph
which was to be to this effect:
</p>
<p class="poem">
Beneath the stone before your eyes<br>
The body of a lover lies;<br>
In life he was a shepherd swain,<br>
In death a victim to disdain.<br>
Ungrateful, cruel, coy, and fair,<br>
Was she that drove him to despair,<br>
And Love hath made her his ally<br>
For spreading wide his tyranny.
</p>
<p class="noindent">
They then strewed upon the grave a profusion of flowers and branches, and
all expressing their condolence with his friend Ambrosio, took their leave.
Vivaldo and his companion did the same; and Don Quixote bade farewell to
his hosts and to the travellers, who pressed him to come with them to
Seville, as being such a convenient place for finding adventures, for they
presented themselves in every street and round every corner oftener than
anywhere else. Don Quixote thanked them for their advice and for the
disposition they showed to do him a favour, and said that for the present
he would not, and must not go to Seville until he had cleared all these
mountains of highwaymen and robbers, of whom report said they were full.
Seeing his good intention, the travellers were unwilling to press him
laid in the bowels of eternal oblivion.” Then turning to Don Quixote and
further, and once more bidding him farewell, they left him and pursued
their journey, in the course of which they did not fail to discuss the
story of Marcela and Chrysostom as well as the madness of Don Quixote. He,
on his part, resolved to go in quest of the shepherdess Marcela, and make
offer to her of all the service he could render her; but things did not
fall out with him as he expected, according to what is related in the
course of this veracious history, of which the Second Part ends here.

The sage Cid Hamete Benengeli relates that as soon as Don Quixote took
leave of his hosts and all who had been present at the burial of
Chrysostom, he and his squire passed into the same wood which they had
seen the shepherdess Marcela enter, and after having wandered for more
than two hours in all directions in search of her without finding her,
they came to a halt in a glade covered with tender grass, beside which ran
a pleasant cool stream that invited and compelled them to pass there the
hours of the noontide heat, which by this time was beginning to come on
oppressively. Don Quixote and Sancho dismounted, and turning Rocinante and
the ass loose to feed on the grass that was there in abundance, they
ransacked the alforjas, and without any ceremony very peacefully and
sociably master and man made their repast on what they found in them.
</p>
<p>
<br><br><br><br> <a id="c15b"></a>

<div class="fig" style="width:60%;">

<p>
Sancho had not thought it worth while to hobble Rocinante, feeling sure,
from what he knew of his staidness and freedom from incontinence, that all
the mares in the Cordova pastures would not lead him into an impropriety.
Chance, however, and the devil, who is not always asleep, so ordained it
that feeding in this valley there was a drove of Galician ponies belonging
to certain Yanguesan carriers, whose way it is to take their midday rest
with their teams in places and spots where grass and water abound; and
that where Don Quixote chanced to be suited the Yanguesans’ purpose very
well. It so happened, then, that Rocinante took a fancy to disport himself
with their ladyships the ponies, and abandoning his usual gait and
demeanour as he scented them, he, without asking leave of his master, got
up a briskish little trot and hastened to make known his wishes to them;
they, however, it seemed, preferred their pasture to him, and received him
with their heels and teeth to such effect that they soon broke his girths
and left him naked without a saddle to cover him; but what must have been
worse to him was that the carriers, seeing the violence he was offering to
their mares, came running up armed with stakes, and so belaboured him that
they brought him sorely battered to the ground.
</p>
<p>
By this time Don Quixote and Sancho, who had witnessed the drubbing of
Rocinante, came up panting, and said Don Quixote to Sancho:
</p>
<p>
“So far as I can see, friend Sancho, these are not knights but base folk
of low birth: I mention it because thou canst lawfully aid me in taking
due vengeance for the insult offered to Rocinante before our eyes.”
</p>
<p>
“What the devil vengeance can we take,” answered Sancho, “if they are more
than twenty, and we no more than two, or, indeed, perhaps not more than
one and a half?”
</p>
<p>
“I count for a hundred,” replied Don Quixote, and without more words he
drew his sword and attacked the Yanguesans and excited and impelled by the
example of his master, Sancho did the same; and to begin with, Don Quixote
delivered a slash at one of them that laid open the leather jerkin he
wore, together with a great portion of his shoulder. The Yanguesans,
seeing themselves assaulted by only two men while they were so many,
betook themselves to their stakes, and driving the two into the middle
they began to lay on with great zeal and energy; in fact, at the second
blow they brought Sancho to the ground, and Don Quixote fared the same
way, all his skill and high mettle availing him nothing, and fate willed
it that he should fall at the feet of Rocinante, who had not yet risen;
whereby it may be seen how furiously stakes can pound in angry boorish
hands.

Then, seeing the mischief they had done, the Yanguesans with all the haste
they could loaded their team and pursued their journey, leaving the two
adventurers a sorry sight and in sorrier mood.
</p>
<p>
Sancho was the first to come to, and finding himself close to his master
he called to him in a weak and doleful voice, “Señor Don Quixote, ah,
Señor Don Quixote!”
</p>
<p>
“What wouldst thou, brother Sancho?” answered Don Quixote in the same
feeble suffering tone as Sancho.
</p>
<p>
“I would like, if it were possible,” answered Sancho Panza, “your worship
to give me a couple of sups of that potion of the fiery Blas, if it be
that you have any to hand there; perhaps it will serve for broken bones as
well as for wounds.”
</p>
<p>
“If I only had it here, wretch that I am, what more should we want?” said
Don Quixote; “but I swear to thee, Sancho Panza, on the faith of a
knight-errant, ere two days are over, unless fortune orders otherwise, I
mean to have it in my possession, or my hand will have lost its cunning.”
</p>
<p>
“But in how many does your worship think we shall have the use of our
feet?” answered Sancho Panza.
</p>
<p>
“For myself I must say I cannot guess how many,” said the battered
knight Don Quixote; “but I take all the blame upon myself, for I had no
business to put hand to sword against men who where not dubbed knights like
myself, and so I believe that in punishment for having transgressed the laws of
chivalry the God of battles has permitted this chastisement to be administered
to me; for which reason, brother Sancho, it is well thou shouldst receive a
hint on the matter which I am now about to mention to thee, for it is of much
importance to the welfare of both of us. It is that when thou shalt see rabble
of this sort offering us insult thou art not to wait till I draw sword against
them, for I shall not do so at all; but do thou draw sword and chastise them to
thy heart’s content, and if any knights come to their aid and defence I
will take care to defend thee and assail them with all my might; and thou hast
already seen by a thousand signs and proofs what the might of this strong arm
of mine is equal to”—so uplifted had the poor gentleman become
through the victory over the stout Biscayan.
</p>
<p>
But Sancho did not so fully approve of his master’s admonition as to let
it pass without saying in reply, “Señor, I am a man of peace, meek and
quiet, and I can put up with any affront because I have a wife and
children to support and bring up; so let it be likewise a hint to your
worship, as it cannot be a mandate, that on no account will I draw sword
either against clown or against knight, and that here before God I forgive
the insults that have been offered me, whether they have been, are, or
shall be offered me by high or low, rich or poor, noble or commoner, not
excepting any rank or condition whatsoever.”
</p>
<p>
To all which his master said in reply, “I wish I had breath enough to
speak somewhat easily, and that the pain I feel on this side would abate
so as to let me explain to thee, Panza, the mistake thou makest. Come now,
sinner, suppose the wind of fortune, hitherto so adverse, should turn in
our favour, filling the sails of our desires so that safely and without
impediment we put into port in some one of those islands I have promised
thee, how would it be with thee if on winning it I made thee lord of it?
Why, thou wilt make it well-nigh impossible through not being a knight nor
having any desire to be one, nor possessing the courage nor the will to
avenge insults or defend thy lordship; for thou must know that in newly
conquered kingdoms and provinces the minds of the inhabitants are never so
quiet nor so well disposed to the new lord that there is no fear of their
making some move to change matters once more, and try, as they say, what
chance may do for them; so it is essential that the new possessor should
have good sense to enable him to govern, and valour to attack and defend
himself, whatever may befall him.”
</p>
<p>
“In what has now befallen us,” answered Sancho, “I’d have been well
pleased to have that good sense and that valour your worship speaks of,
but I swear on the faith of a poor man I am more fit for plasters than for
arguments. See if your worship can get up, and let us help Rocinante,
though he does not deserve it, for he was the main cause of all this
thrashing. I never thought it of Rocinante, for I took him to be a
virtuous person and as quiet as myself. After all, they say right that it
takes a long time to come to know people, and that there is nothing sure
in this life. Who would have said that, after such mighty slashes as your
worship gave that unlucky knight-errant, there was coming, travelling post
and at the very heels of them, such a great storm of sticks as has fallen
upon our shoulders?”
</p>
<p>
“And yet thine, Sancho,” replied Don Quixote, “ought to be used to such
squalls; but mine, reared in soft cloth and fine linen, it is plain they
must feel more keenly the pain of this mishap, and if it were not that I
imagine—why do I say imagine?—know of a certainty that all
these annoyances are very necessary accompaniments of the calling of arms,
I would lay me down here to die of pure vexation.”
</p>
<p>
crowned with garlands which, as afterwards appeared, were, some of them of
To this the squire replied, “Señor, as these mishaps are what one reaps of
chivalry, tell me if they happen very often, or if they have their own
fixed times for coming to pass; because it seems to me that after two
harvests we shall be no good for the third, unless God in his infinite
mercy helps us.”
</p>
<p>
“Know, friend Sancho,” answered Don Quixote, “that the life of
knights-errant is subject to a thousand dangers and reverses, and neither
more nor less is it within immediate possibility for knights-errant to
become kings and emperors, as experience has shown in the case of many
different knights with whose histories I am thoroughly acquainted; and I
could tell thee now, if the pain would let me, of some who simply by might
of arm have risen to the high stations I have mentioned; and those same,
both before and after, experienced divers misfortunes and miseries; for
the valiant Amadis of Gaul found himself in the power of his mortal enemy
Arcalaus the magician, who, it is positively asserted, holding him
captive, gave him more than two hundred lashes with the reins of his horse
while tied to one of the pillars of a court; and moreover there is a
certain recondite author of no small authority who says that the Knight of
Phœbus, being caught in a certain pitfall, which opened under his feet in
a certain castle, on falling found himself bound hand and foot in a deep
pit underground, where they administered to him one of those things they
call clysters, of sand and snow-water, that well-nigh finished him; and if
he had not been succoured in that sore extremity by a sage, a great friend
of his, it would have gone very hard with the poor knight; so I may well
suffer in company with such worthy folk, for greater were the indignities
which they had to suffer than those which we suffer. For I would have thee
know, Sancho, that wounds caused by any instruments which happen by chance
to be in hand inflict no indignity, and this is laid down in the law of
the duel in express words: if, for instance, the cobbler strikes another
with the last which he has in his hand, though it be in fact a piece of
wood, it cannot be said for that reason that he whom he struck with it has
been cudgelled. I say this lest thou shouldst imagine that because we have
been drubbed in this affray we have therefore suffered any indignity; for
the arms those men carried, with which they pounded us, were nothing more
than their stakes, and not one of them, so far as I remember, carried
rapier, sword, or dagger.”
</p>
<p>
“They gave me no time to see that much,” answered Sancho, “for hardly had
I laid hand on my tizona when they signed the cross on my shoulders with
their sticks in such style that they took the sight out of my eyes and the
strength out of my feet, stretching me where I now lie, and where thinking
of whether all those stake-strokes were an indignity or not gives me no
uneasiness, which the pain of the blows does, for they will remain as
deeply impressed on my memory as on my shoulders.”
</p>
<p>
“For all that let me tell thee, brother Panza,” said Don Quixote, “that
there is no recollection which time does not put an end to, and no pain
which death does not remove.”
</p>
</p>
<p>
“And what greater misfortune can there be,” replied Panza, “than the one
that waits for time to put an end to it and death to remove it? If our
mishap were one of those that are cured with a couple of plasters, it
would not be so bad; but I am beginning to think that all the plasters in
a hospital almost won’t be enough to put us right.”
</p>
<p>
“No more of that: pluck strength out of weakness, Sancho, as I mean to
do,” returned Don Quixote, “and let us see how Rocinante is, for it seems
to me that not the least share of this mishap has fallen to the lot of the
poor beast.”
</p>
<p>
“There is nothing wonderful in that,” replied Sancho, “since he is a
knight-errant too; what I wonder at is that my beast should have come off
scot-free where we come out scotched.”
</p>
<p>
“Fortune always leaves a door open in adversity in order to bring relief
to it,” said Don Quixote; “I say so because this little beast may now
supply the want of Rocinante, carrying me hence to some castle where I may
be cured of my wounds. And moreover I shall not hold it any dishonour to
be so mounted, for I remember having read how the good old Silenus, the
tutor and instructor of the gay god of laughter, when he entered the city
of the hundred gates, went very contentedly mounted on a handsome ass.”
</p>
<p>
“It may be true that he went mounted as your worship says,” answered
Sancho, “but there is a great difference between going mounted and going
slung like a sack of manure.”
</p>
<p>
To which Don Quixote replied, “Wounds received in battle confer honour
instead of taking it away; and so, friend Panza, say no more, but, as I
told thee before, get up as well as thou canst and put me on top of thy
beast in whatever fashion pleases thee best, and let us go hence ere night
come on and surprise us in these wilds.”
</p>
<p>
“And yet I have heard your worship say,” observed Panza, “that it is very
meet for knights-errant to sleep in wastes and deserts, and that they
esteem it very good fortune.”
</p>
<p>
“That is,” said Don Quixote, “when they cannot help it, or when they are
in love; and so true is this that there have been knights who have
remained two years on rocks, in sunshine and shade and all the
inclemencies of heaven, without their ladies knowing anything of it; and
one of these was Amadis, when, under the name of Beltenebros, he took up
his abode on the Peña Pobre for—I know not if it was eight years or
eight months, for I am not very sure of the reckoning; at any rate he
stayed there doing penance for I know not what pique the Princess Oriana
had against him; but no more of this now, Sancho, and make haste before a
mishap like Rocinante’s befalls the ass.”
</p>
<p>
“The very devil would be in it in that case,” said Sancho; and letting off
thirty “ohs,” and sixty sighs, and a hundred and twenty maledictions and
execrations on whomsoever it was that had brought him there, he raised
himself, stopping half-way bent like a Turkish bow without power to bring
himself upright, but with all his pains he saddled his ass, who too had
gone astray somewhat, yielding to the excessive licence of the day; he
next raised up Rocinante, and as for him, had he possessed a tongue to
complain with, most assuredly neither Sancho nor his master would have
been behind him.

To be brief, Sancho fixed Don Quixote on the ass and secured Rocinante
with a leading rein, and taking the ass by the halter, he proceeded more
or less in the direction in which it seemed to him the high road might be;
and, as chance was conducting their affairs for them from good to better,
he had not gone a short league when the road came in sight, and on it he
perceived an inn, which to his annoyance and to the delight of Don Quixote
must needs be a castle. Sancho insisted that it was an inn, and his master
that it was not one, but a castle, and the dispute lasted so long that
before the point was settled they had time to reach it, and into it Sancho
entered with all his team without any further controversy.

The innkeeper, seeing Don Quixote slung across the ass, asked Sancho what
was amiss with him. Sancho answered that it was nothing, only that he had
fallen down from a rock and had his ribs a little bruised. The innkeeper
had a wife whose disposition was not such as those of her calling commonly
have, for she was by nature kind-hearted and felt for the sufferings of
her neighbours, so she at once set about tending Don Quixote, and made her
young daughter, a very comely girl, help her in taking care of her guest.
There was besides in the inn, as servant, an Asturian lass with a broad
face, flat poll, and snub nose, blind of one eye and not very sound in the
other. The elegance of her shape, to be sure, made up for all her defects;
she did not measure seven palms from head to foot, and her shoulders,
which overweighted her somewhat, made her contemplate the ground more than
she liked. This graceful lass, then, helped the young girl, and the two
made up a very bad bed for Don Quixote in a garret that showed evident
signs of having formerly served for many years as a straw-loft, in which
there was also quartered a carrier whose bed was placed a little beyond
our Don Quixote’s, and, though only made of the pack-saddles and cloths of
his mules, had much the advantage of it, as Don Quixote’s consisted simply
of four rough boards on two not very even trestles, a mattress, that for
thinness might have passed for a quilt, full of pellets which, were they
not seen through the rents to be wool, would to the touch have seemed
pebbles in hardness, two sheets made of buckler leather, and a coverlet
the threads of which anyone that chose might have counted without missing
one in the reckoning.
</p>
<p>
On this accursed bed Don Quixote stretched himself, and the hostess and
her daughter soon covered him with plasters from top to toe, while
Maritornes—for that was the name of the Asturian—held the
light for them, and while plastering him, the hostess, observing how full
of wheals Don Quixote was in some places, remarked that this had more the
look of blows than of a fall.
</p>
<p>
It was not blows, Sancho said, but that the rock had many points and
projections, and that each of them had left its mark. “Pray, señora,” he
added, “manage to save some tow, as there will be no want of someone to
use it, for my loins too are rather sore.”
</p>
<p>
“Then you must have fallen too,” said the hostess.
</p>
<p>
“I did not fall,” said Sancho Panza, “but from the shock I got at seeing
my master fall, my body aches so that I feel as if I had had a thousand
thwacks.”
</p>
<p>
profess, and so I go through these solitudes and wilds seeking adventures,
“That may well be,” said the young girl, “for it has many a time happened
to me to dream that I was falling down from a tower and never coming to
the ground, and when I awoke from the dream to find myself as weak and
shaken as if I had really fallen.”
</p>
<p>
“There is the point, señora,” replied Sancho Panza, “that I without
dreaming at all, but being more awake than I am now, find myself with
scarcely less wheals than my master, Don Quixote.”
</p>
<p>
“How is the gentleman called?” asked Maritornes the Asturian.
</p>

“Don Quixote of La Mancha,” answered Sancho Panza, “and he is a
knight-adventurer, and one of the best and stoutest that have been seen in
the world this long time past.”
</p>
<p>
“What is a knight-adventurer?” said the lass.
</p>
<p>
“Are you so new in the world as not to know?” answered Sancho Panza.
“Well, then, you must know, sister, that a knight-adventurer is a thing
that in two words is seen drubbed and emperor, that is to-day the most
miserable and needy being in the world, and to-morrow will have two or
three crowns of kingdoms to give his squire.”
</p>
<p>
“Then how is it,” said the hostess, “that belonging to so good a master as
this, you have not, to judge by appearances, even so much as a county?”
</p>
<p>
“It is too soon yet,” answered Sancho, “for we have only been a month
going in quest of adventures, and so far we have met with nothing that can
be called one, for it will happen that when one thing is looked for
another thing is found; however, if my master Don Quixote gets well of
this wound, or fall, and I am left none the worse of it, I would not
change my hopes for the best title in Spain.”
</p>
<p>
To all this conversation Don Quixote was listening very attentively, and
sitting up in bed as well as he could, and taking the hostess by the hand
he said to her, “Believe me, fair lady, you may call yourself fortunate in
having in this castle of yours sheltered my person, which is such that if
I do not myself praise it, it is because of what is commonly said, that
self-praise debaseth; but my squire will inform you who I am. I only tell
you that I shall preserve for ever inscribed on my memory the service you
have rendered me in order to tender you my gratitude while life shall last
me; and would to Heaven love held me not so enthralled and subject to its
laws and to the eyes of that fair ingrate whom I name between my teeth,
but that those of this lovely damsel might be the masters of my liberty.”
</p>
<p>
The hostess, her daughter, and the worthy Maritornes listened in
bewilderment to the words of the knight-errant; for they understood about
as much of them as if he had been talking Greek, though they could
perceive they were all meant for expressions of good-will and
blandishments; and not being accustomed to this kind of language, they
stared at him and wondered to themselves, for he seemed to them a man of a
different sort from those they were used to, and thanking him in pothouse
phrase for his civility they left him, while the Asturian gave her
attention to Sancho, who needed it no less than his master.
</p>
<p>
The carrier had made an arrangement with her for recreation that night,
and she had given him her word that when the guests were quiet and the
family asleep she would come in search of him and meet his wishes
unreservedly. And it is said of this good lass that she never made
promises of the kind without fulfilling them, even though she made them in
a forest and without any witness present, for she plumed herself greatly
on being a lady and held it no disgrace to be in such an employment as
servant in an inn, because, she said, misfortunes and ill-luck had brought
her to that position. The hard, narrow, wretched, rickety bed of Don
Quixote stood first in the middle of this star-lit stable, and close
beside it Sancho made his, which merely consisted of a rush mat and a
blanket that looked as if it was of threadbare canvas rather than of wool.
Next to these two beds was that of the carrier, made up, as has been said,
of the pack-saddles and all the trappings of the two best mules he had,
though there were twelve of them, sleek, plump, and in prime condition,
for he was one of the rich carriers of Arévalo, according to the author of
this history, who particularly mentions this carrier because he knew him
very well, and they even say was in some degree a relation of his; besides
which Cid Hamete Benengeli was a historian of great research and accuracy
in all things, as is very evident since he would not pass over in silence
those that have been already mentioned, however trifling and insignificant
they might be, an example that might be followed by those grave historians
who relate transactions so curtly and briefly that we hardly get a taste
of them, all the substance of the work being left in the inkstand from
carelessness, perverseness, or ignorance. A thousand blessings on the
author of “Tablante de Ricamonte” and that of the other book in which the
deeds of the Conde Tomillas are recounted; with what minuteness they
describe everything!
</p>
<p>
To proceed, then: after having paid a visit to his team and given them
their second feed, the carrier stretched himself on his pack-saddles and
lay waiting for his conscientious Maritornes. Sancho was by this time
plastered and had lain down, and though he strove to sleep the pain of his
ribs would not let him, while Don Quixote with the pain of his had his
eyes as wide open as a hare’s.

The inn was all in silence, and in the whole of it there was no light
except that given by a lantern that hung burning in the middle of the
gateway. This strange stillness, and the thoughts, always present to our
knight’s mind, of the incidents described at every turn in the books that
were the cause of his misfortune, conjured up to his imagination as
extraordinary a delusion as can well be conceived, which was that he
fancied himself to have reached a famous castle (for, as has been said,
all the inns he lodged in were castles to his eyes), and that the daughter
of the innkeeper was daughter of the lord of the castle, and that she, won
by his high-bred bearing, had fallen in love with him, and had promised to
come to his bed for a while that night without the knowledge of her
parents; and holding all this fantasy that he had constructed as solid
fact, he began to feel uneasy and to consider the perilous risk which his
virtue was about to encounter, and he resolved in his heart to commit no
treason to his lady Dulcinea del Toboso, even though the queen Guinevere
herself and the dame Quintañona should present themselves before him.
</p>
<p>
While he was taken up with these vagaries, then, the time and the hour—an
unlucky one for him—arrived for the Asturian to come, who in her
smock, with bare feet and her hair gathered into a fustian coif, with
noiseless and cautious steps entered the chamber where the three were
quartered, in quest of the carrier; but scarcely had she gained the door
when Don Quixote perceived her, and sitting up in his bed in spite of his
plasters and the pain of his ribs, he stretched out his arms to receive
his beauteous damsel. The Asturian, who went all doubled up and in silence
with her hands before her feeling for her lover, encountered the arms of
Don Quixote, who grasped her tightly by the wrist, and drawing her towards
him, while she dared not utter a word, made her sit down on the bed. He
then felt her smock, and although it was of sackcloth it appeared to him
to be of the finest and softest silk: on her wrists she wore some glass
beads, but to him they had the sheen of precious Orient pearls: her hair,
which in some measure resembled a horse’s mane, he rated as threads of the
brightest gold of Araby, whose refulgence dimmed the sun himself: her
breath, which no doubt smelt of yesterday’s stale salad, seemed to him to
diffuse a sweet aromatic fragrance from her mouth; and, in short, he drew
her portrait in his imagination with the same features and in the same
style as that which he had seen in his books of the other princesses who,
smitten by love, came with all the adornments that are here set down, to
see the sorely wounded knight; and so great was the poor gentleman’s
blindness that neither touch, nor smell, nor anything else about the good
lass that would have made any but a carrier vomit, were enough to
undeceive him; on the contrary, he was persuaded he had the goddess of
beauty in his arms, and holding her firmly in his grasp he went on to say
in low, tender voice:
</p>
<p>
“Would that I found myself, lovely and exalted lady, in a position to
repay such a favour as that which you, by the sight of your great beauty, have
granted me; but fortune, which is never weary of persecuting the good, has
chosen to place me upon this bed, where I lie so bruised and broken that though
my inclination would gladly comply with yours it is impossible; besides, to
this impossibility another yet greater is to be added, which is the faith that
I have pledged to the peerless Dulcinea del Toboso, sole lady of my most secret
thoughts; and were it not that this stood in the way I should not be so
insensible a knight as to miss the happy opportunity which your great goodness
has offered me.”
</p>
<p>
Maritornes was fretting and sweating at finding herself held so fast by
Don Quixote, and not understanding or heeding the words he addressed to
her, she strove without speaking to free herself. The worthy carrier,
whose unholy thoughts kept him awake, was aware of his doxy the moment she
entered the door, and was listening attentively to all Don Quixote said;
and jealous that the Asturian should have broken her word with him for
another, drew nearer to Don Quixote’s bed and stood still to see what
would come of this talk which he could not understand; but when he
perceived the wench struggling to get free and Don Quixote striving to
hold her, not relishing the joke he raised his arm and delivered such a
terrible cuff on the lank jaws of the amorous knight that he bathed all
his mouth in blood, and not content with this he mounted on his ribs and
with his feet tramped all over them at a pace rather smarter than a trot.
The bed which was somewhat crazy and not very firm on its feet, unable to
support the additional weight of the carrier, came to the ground, and at
the mighty crash of this the innkeeper awoke and at once concluded that it
must be some brawl of Maritornes’, because after calling loudly to her he
got no answer. With this suspicion he got up, and lighting a lamp hastened
to the quarter where he had heard the disturbance. The wench, seeing that
her master was coming and knowing that his temper was terrible, frightened
and panic-stricken made for the bed of Sancho Panza, who still slept, and
crouching upon it made a ball of herself.
</p>
<p>
The innkeeper came in exclaiming, “Where art thou, strumpet? Of course
this is some of thy work.” At this Sancho awoke, and feeling this mass
almost on top of him fancied he had the nightmare and began to distribute
fisticuffs all round, of which a certain share fell upon Maritornes, who,
irritated by the pain and flinging modesty aside, paid back so many in
return to Sancho that she woke him up in spite of himself. He then,
finding himself so handled, by whom he knew not, raising himself up as
well as he could, grappled with Maritornes, and he and she between them
began the bitterest and drollest scrimmage in the world. The carrier,
however, perceiving by the light of the innkeeper candle how it fared with
his ladylove, quitting Don Quixote, ran to bring her the help she needed;
and the innkeeper did the same but with a different intention, for his was
to chastise the lass, as he believed that beyond a doubt she alone was the
cause of all the harmony. And so, as the saying is, cat to rat, rat to
rope, rope to stick, the carrier pounded Sancho, Sancho the lass, she him,
and the innkeeper her, and all worked away so briskly that they did not
give themselves a moment’s rest; and the best of it was that the
innkeeper’s lamp went out, and as they were left in the dark they all laid
on one upon the other in a mass so unmercifully that there was not a sound
spot left where a hand could light.
</p>
<p>
It so happened that there was lodging that night in the inn a caudrillero
of what they call the Old Holy Brotherhood of Toledo, who, also hearing
the extraordinary noise of the conflict, seized his staff and the tin case
with his warrants, and made his way in the dark into the room crying:
“Hold! in the name of the Jurisdiction! Hold! in the name of the Holy
Brotherhood!”
</p>
<p>
The first that he came upon was the pummelled Don Quixote, who lay
stretched senseless on his back upon his broken-down bed, and, his hand
falling on the beard as he felt about, he continued to cry, “Help for the
Jurisdiction!” but perceiving that he whom he had laid hold of did not
move or stir, he concluded that he was dead and that those in the room
were his murderers, and with this suspicion he raised his voice still
higher, calling out, “Shut the inn gate; see that no one goes out; they
have killed a man here!” This cry startled them all, and each dropped the
contest at the point at which the voice reached him. The innkeeper
retreated to his room, the carrier to his pack-saddles, the lass to her
crib; the unlucky Don Quixote and Sancho alone were unable to move from
where they were. The cuadrillero on this let go Don Quixote’s beard, and
went out to look for a light to search for and apprehend the culprits; but
not finding one, as the innkeeper had purposely extinguished the lantern
on retreating to his room, he was compelled to have recourse to the
hearth, where after much time and trouble he lit another lamp.

By this time Don Quixote had recovered from his swoon; and in the same
tone of voice in which he had called to his squire the day before when he
lay stretched “in the vale of the stakes,” he began calling to him now,
“Sancho, my friend, art thou asleep? sleepest thou, friend Sancho?”
</p>
<p>
“How can I sleep, curses on it!” returned Sancho discontentedly and
bitterly, “when it is plain that all the devils have been at me this
night?”
</p>
<p>
“Thou mayest well believe that,” answered Don Quixote, “because, either I
know little, or this castle is enchanted, for thou must know—but
this that I am now about to tell thee thou must swear to keep secret until
after my death.”
</p>
<p>
“I swear it,” answered Sancho.
</p>
<p>
“I say so,” continued Don Quixote, “because I hate taking away anyone’s
good name.”
</p>
<p>
“I say,” replied Sancho, “that I swear to hold my tongue about it till the
end of your worship’s days, and God grant I may be able to let it out
to-morrow.”
</p>
<p>
“Do I do thee such injuries, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “that thou wouldst
see me dead so soon?”
</p>
<p>
“It is not for that,” replied Sancho, “but because I hate keeping things
long, and I don’t want them to grow rotten with me from over-keeping.”
</p>
<p>
“At any rate,” said Don Quixote, “I have more confidence in thy affection
and good nature; and so I would have thee know that this night there
befell me one of the strangest adventures that I could describe, and to
relate it to thee briefly thou must know that a little while ago the
daughter of the lord of this castle came to me, and that she is the most
elegant and beautiful damsel that could be found in the wide world. What I
could tell thee of the charms of her person! of her lively wit! of other
<p>
secret matters which, to preserve the fealty I owe to my lady Dulcinea del
Toboso, I shall pass over unnoticed and in silence! I will only tell thee
that, either fate being envious of so great a boon placed in my hands by
good fortune, or perhaps (and this is more probable) this castle being, as
I have already said, enchanted, at the time when I was engaged in the
sweetest and most amorous discourse with her, there came, without my
seeing or knowing whence it came, a hand attached to some arm of some huge
giant, that planted such a cuff on my jaws that I have them all bathed in
blood, and then pummelled me in such a way that I am in a worse plight
than yesterday when the carriers, on account of Rocinante’s misbehaviour,
inflicted on us the injury thou knowest of; whence conjecture that there
must be some enchanted Moor guarding the treasure of this damsel’s beauty,
and that it is not for me.”
