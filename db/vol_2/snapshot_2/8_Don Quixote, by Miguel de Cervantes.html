garden, and were gathering the fruit though it was not yet ripe. The old
man was alarmed and Zoraida too, for the Moors commonly, and, so to speak,
instinctively have a dread of the Turks, but particularly of the soldiers,
who are so insolent and domineering to the Moors who are under their power
that they treat them worse than if they were their slaves. Her father said
to Zoraida, “Daughter, retire into the house and shut thyself in while I
go and speak to these dogs; and thou, Christian, pick thy herbs, and go in
peace, and Allah bring thee safe to thy own country.”
</p>
<p>
I bowed, and he went away to look for the Turks, leaving me alone with
Zoraida, who made as if she were about to retire as her father bade her;
but the moment he was concealed by the trees of the garden, turning to me
with her eyes full of tears she said, “Tameji, cristiano, tameji?” that is
to say, “Art thou going, Christian, art thou going?”
</p>
<p>
I made answer, “Yes, lady, but not without thee, come what may: be on the
watch for me on the next Juma, and be not alarmed when thou seest us; for
most surely we shall go to the land of the Christians.”
</p>
<p>
This I said in such a way that she understood perfectly all that passed between
us, and throwing her arm round my neck she began with feeble steps to move
towards the house; but as fate would have it (and it might have been very
unfortunate if Heaven had not otherwise ordered it), just as we were moving on
in the manner and position I have described, with her arm round my neck, her
father, as he returned after having sent away the Turks, saw how we were
walking and we perceived that he saw us; but Zoraida, ready and quickwitted,
took care not to remove her arm from my neck, but on the contrary drew closer
to me and laid her head on my breast, bending her knees a little and showing
all the signs and tokens of fainting, while I at the same time made it seem as
though I were supporting her against my will. Her father came running up to
where we were, and seeing his daughter in this state asked what was the matter
with her; she, however, giving no answer, he said, “No doubt she has
fainted in alarm at the entrance of those dogs,” and taking her from mine
he drew her to his own breast, while she sighing, her eyes still wet with
tears, said again, “Ameji, cristiano, ameji”—“Go,
Christian, go.” To this her father replied, “There is no need,
daughter, for the Christian to go, for he has done thee no harm, and the Turks
have now gone; feel no alarm, there is nothing to hurt thee, for as I say, the
Turks at my request have gone back the way they came.”

“It was they who terrified her, as thou hast said, señor,” said I to her
father; “but since she tells me to go, I have no wish to displease her:
peace be with thee, and with thy leave I will come back to this garden for
herbs if need be, for my master says there are nowhere better herbs for
salad than here.”
</p>
<p>
“Come back for any thou hast need of,” replied Hadji Morato; “for my
daughter does not speak thus because she is displeased with thee or any
Christian: she only meant that the Turks should go, not thou; or that it
was time for thee to look for thy herbs.”
</p>
<p>
With this I at once took my leave of both; and she, looking as though her
heart were breaking, retired with her father. While pretending to look for
herbs I made the round of the garden at my ease, and studied carefully all
the approaches and outlets, and the fastenings of the house and everything
that could be taken advantage of to make our task easy.

Having done so I went and gave an account of all that had taken place to
the renegade and my comrades, and looked forward with impatience to the
hour when, all fear at an end, I should find myself in possession of the
prize which fortune held out to me in the fair and lovely Zoraida. The
time passed at length, and the appointed day we so longed for arrived;
and, all following out the arrangement and plan which, after careful
consideration and many a long discussion, we had decided upon, we
succeeded as fully as we could have wished; for on the Friday following
the day upon which I spoke to Zoraida in the garden, the renegade anchored
his vessel at nightfall almost opposite the spot where she was. The
Christians who were to row were ready and in hiding in different places
round about, all waiting for me, anxious and elated, and eager to attack
the vessel they had before their eyes; for they did not know the
renegade’s plan, but expected that they were to gain their liberty by
force of arms and by killing the Moors who were on board the vessel. As
soon, then, as I and my comrades made our appearance, all those that were
in hiding seeing us came and joined us. It was now the time when the city
gates are shut, and there was no one to be seen in all the space outside.
When we were collected together we debated whether it would be better
first to go for Zoraida, or to make prisoners of the Moorish rowers who
rowed in the vessel; but while we were still uncertain our renegade came
up asking us what kept us, as it was now the time, and all the Moors were
off their guard and most of them asleep. We told him why we hesitated, but
he said it was of more importance first to secure the vessel, which could
be done with the greatest ease and without any danger, and then we could
go for Zoraida. We all approved of what he said, and so without further
delay, guided by him we made for the vessel, and he leaping on board
first, drew his cutlass and said in Morisco, “Let no one stir from this if
he does not want it to cost him his life.” By this almost all the
Christians were on board, and the Moors, who were fainthearted, hearing
their captain speak in this way, were cowed, and without any one of them
taking to his arms (and indeed they had few or hardly any) they submitted
without saying a word to be bound by the Christians, who quickly secured
them, threatening them that if they raised any kind of outcry they would
be all put to the sword. This having been accomplished, and half of our
party being left to keep guard over them, the rest of us, again taking the
renegade as our guide, hastened towards Hadji Morato’s garden, and as good
luck would have it, on trying the gate it opened as easily as if it had
not been locked; and so, quite quietly and in silence, we reached the
house without being perceived by anybody. The lovely Zoraida was watching
for us at a window, and as soon as she perceived that there were people
there, she asked in a low voice if we were “Nizarani,” as much as to say
or ask if we were Christians. I answered that we were, and begged her to
come down. As soon as she recognised me she did not delay an instant, but
without answering a word came down immediately, opened the door and
presented herself before us all, so beautiful and so richly attired that I
cannot attempt to describe her. The moment I saw her I took her hand and
kissed it, and the renegade and my two comrades did the same; and the
rest, who knew nothing of the circumstances, did as they saw us do, for it
only seemed as if we were returning thanks to her, and recognising her as
the giver of our liberty. The renegade asked her in the Morisco language
if her father was in the house. She replied that he was and that he was
asleep.
</p>
<p>
“Then it will be necessary to waken him and take him with us,” said the
renegade, “and everything of value in this fair mansion.”
</p>
<p>
“Nay,” said she, “my father must not on any account be touched, and there
is nothing in the house except what I shall take, and that will be quite
enough to enrich and satisfy all of you; wait a little and you shall see,”
and so saying she went in, telling us she would return immediately and
bidding us keep quiet without making any noise.
</p>
<p>
I asked the renegade what had passed between them, and when he told me, I
declared that nothing should be done except in accordance with the wishes
of Zoraida, who now came back with a little trunk so full of gold crowns
that she could scarcely carry it. Unfortunately her father awoke while
this was going on, and hearing a noise in the garden, came to the window,
and at once perceiving that all those who were there were Christians,
raising a prodigiously loud outcry, he began to call out in Arabic,
“Christians, Christians! thieves, thieves!” by which cries we were all
thrown into the greatest fear and embarrassment; but the renegade seeing
the danger we were in and how important it was for him to effect his
purpose before we were heard, mounted with the utmost quickness to where
Hadji Morato was, and with him went some of our party; I, however, did not
dare to leave Zoraida, who had fallen almost fainting in my arms. To be
brief, those who had gone upstairs acted so promptly that in an instant
they came down, carrying Hadji Morato with his hands bound and a napkin
tied over his mouth, which prevented him from uttering a word, warning him
at the same time that to attempt to speak would cost him his life. When
his daughter caught sight of him she covered her eyes so as not to see
him, and her father was horror-stricken, not knowing how willingly she had
placed herself in our hands. But it was now most essential for us to be on
the move, and carefully and quickly we regained the vessel, where those
who had remained on board were waiting for us in apprehension of some
mishap having befallen us. It was barely two hours after night set in when
we were all on board the vessel, where the cords were removed from the
hands of Zoraida’s father, and the napkin from his mouth; but the renegade
once more told him not to utter a word, or they would take his life. He,
when he saw his daughter there, began to sigh piteously, and still more
when he perceived that I held her closely embraced and that she lay quiet
without resisting or complaining, or showing any reluctance; nevertheless
he remained silent lest they should carry into effect the repeated threats
the renegade had addressed to him.
</p>
<p>
Finding herself now on board, and that we were about to give way with the
oars, Zoraida, seeing her father there, and the other Moors bound, bade
the renegade ask me to do her the favour of releasing the Moors and
setting her father at liberty, for she would rather drown herself in the
sea than suffer a father that had loved her so dearly to be carried away
captive before her eyes and on her account. The renegade repeated this to
me, and I replied that I was very willing to do so; but he replied that it
was not advisable, because if they were left there they would at once
raise the country and stir up the city, and lead to the despatch of swift
cruisers in pursuit, and our being taken, by sea or land, without any
possibility of escape; and that all that could be done was to set them
free on the first Christian ground we reached. On this point we all
avenged thee that instant, or even now; but neither then nor now could I,
agreed; and Zoraida, to whom it was explained, together with the reasons
that prevented us from doing at once what she desired, was satisfied
likewise; and then in glad silence and with cheerful alacrity each of our
stout rowers took his oar, and commending ourselves to God with all our
hearts, we began to shape our course for the island of Majorca, the
nearest Christian land. Owing, however, to the Tramontana rising a little,
and the sea growing somewhat rough, it was impossible for us to keep a
straight course for Majorca, and we were compelled to coast in the
direction of Oran, not without great uneasiness on our part lest we should
be observed from the town of Shershel, which lies on that coast, not more
than sixty miles from Algiers. Moreover we were afraid of meeting on that
course one of the galliots that usually come with goods from Tetuan;
although each of us for himself and all of us together felt confident
that, if we were to meet a merchant galliot, so that it were not a
cruiser, not only should we not be lost, but that we should take a vessel
in which we could more safely accomplish our voyage. As we pursued our
course Zoraida kept her head between my hands so as not to see her father,
and I felt that she was praying to Lela Marien to help us.
</p>
<p>
<br><br><br><br> <a id="c41d"></a>

<div class="fig" style="width:60%;">

<br><br><br>
</p>
<p>
We might have made about thirty miles when daybreak found us some three
musket-shots off the land, which seemed to us deserted, and without anyone
to see us. For all that, however, by hard rowing we put out a little to
sea, for it was now somewhat calmer, and having gained about two leagues
the word was given to row by batches, while we ate something, for the
vessel was well provided; but the rowers said it was not a time to take
any rest; let food be served out to those who were not rowing, but they
would not leave their oars on any account. This was done, but now a stiff
breeze began to blow, which obliged us to leave off rowing and make sail
at once and steer for Oran, as it was impossible to make any other course.
All this was done very promptly, and under sail we ran more than eight
miles an hour without any fear, except that of coming across some vessel
out on a roving expedition. We gave the Moorish rowers some food, and the
renegade comforted them by telling them that they were not held as
captives, as we should set them free on the first opportunity.
</p>
<p>
The same was said to Zoraida’s father, who replied, “Anything else,
Christian, I might hope for or think likely from your generosity and good
behaviour, but do not think me so simple as to imagine you will give me my
liberty; for you would have never exposed yourselves to the danger of
depriving me of it only to restore it to me so generously, especially as
you know who I am and the sum you may expect to receive on restoring it;
and if you will only name that, I here offer you all you require for
myself and for my unhappy daughter there; or else for her alone, for she
is the greatest and most precious part of my soul.”
</p>
<p>
As he said this he began to weep so bitterly that he filled us all with
compassion and forced Zoraida to look at him, and when she saw him weeping
she was so moved that she rose from my feet and ran to throw her arms
round him, and pressing her face to his, they both gave way to such an
outburst of tears that several of us were constrained to keep them
company.
</p>
<p>
But when her father saw her in full dress and with all her jewels about
her, he said to her in his own language, “What means this, my daughter?
Last night, before this terrible misfortune in which we are plunged befell
us, I saw thee in thy everyday and indoor garments; and now, without
having had time to attire thyself, and without my bringing thee any joyful
tidings to furnish an occasion for adorning and bedecking thyself, I see
thee arrayed in the finest attire it would be in my power to give thee
when fortune was most kind to us. Answer me this; for it causes me greater
anxiety and surprise than even this misfortune itself.”
</p>
<p>
The renegade interpreted to us what the Moor said to his daughter; she,
however, returned him no answer. But when he observed in one corner of the
vessel the little trunk in which she used to keep her jewels, which he
well knew he had left in Algiers and had not brought to the garden, he was
still more amazed, and asked her how that trunk had come into our hands,
and what there was in it. To which the renegade, without waiting for
Zoraida to reply, made answer, “Do not trouble thyself by asking thy
daughter Zoraida so many questions, señor, for the one answer I will give
thee will serve for all; I would have thee know that she is a Christian,
and that it is she who has been the file for our chains and our deliverer
from captivity. She is here of her own free will, as glad, I imagine, to
find herself in this position as he who escapes from darkness into the
light, from death to life, and from suffering to glory.”
</p>
<p>
“Daughter, is this true, what he says?” cried the Moor.
</p>
<p>
“It is,” replied Zoraida.
</p>
<p>
“That thou art in truth a Christian,” said the old man, “and that thou
hast given thy father into the power of his enemies?”
</p>
<p>
To which Zoraida made answer, “A Christian I am, but it is not I who have
placed thee in this position, for it never was my wish to leave thee or do
thee harm, but only to do good to myself.”
</p>
<p>
“And what good hast thou done thyself, daughter?” said he.
</p>
<p>
“Ask thou that,” said she, “of Lela Marien, for she can tell thee better
than I.”
</p>
<p>
The Moor had hardly heard these words when with marvellous quickness he
flung himself headforemost into the sea, where no doubt he would have been
drowned had not the long and full dress he wore held him up for a little
on the surface of the water. Zoraida cried aloud to us to save him, and we
all hastened to help, and seizing him by his robe we drew him in half
drowned and insensible, at which Zoraida was in such distress that she
wept over him as piteously and bitterly as though he were already dead. We
turned him upon his face and he voided a great quantity of water, and at
the end of two hours came to himself. Meanwhile, the wind having changed
we were compelled to head for the land, and ply our oars to avoid being
driven on shore; but it was our good fortune to reach a creek that lies on
one side of a small promontory or cape, called by the Moors that of the
“Cava rumia,” which in our language means “the wicked Christian woman;”
for it is a tradition among them that La Cava, through whom Spain was
lost, lies buried at that spot; “cava” in their language meaning “wicked
woman,” and “rumia” “Christian;” moreover, they count it unlucky to anchor
there when necessity compels them, and they never do so otherwise. For us,
however, it was not the resting-place of the wicked woman but a haven of
safety for our relief, so much had the sea now got up. We posted a
look-out on shore, and never let the oars out of our hands, and ate of the
stores the renegade had laid in, imploring God and Our Lady with all our
hearts to help and protect us, that we might give a happy ending to a
beginning so prosperous. At the entreaty of Zoraida orders were given to
set on shore her father and the other Moors who were still bound, for she
could not endure, nor could her tender heart bear to see her father in
bonds and her fellow-countrymen prisoners before her eyes. We promised her
to do this at the moment of departure, for as it was uninhabited we ran no
risk in releasing them at that place.
</p>
<p>
Our prayers were not so far in vain as to be unheard by Heaven, for after
a while the wind changed in our favour, and made the sea calm, inviting us
once more to resume our voyage with a good heart. Seeing this we unbound
the Moors, and one by one put them on shore, at which they were filled
with amazement; but when we came to land Zoraida’s father, who had now
completely recovered his senses, he said:
</p>
<p>
“Why is it, think ye, Christians, that this wicked woman is rejoiced at
your giving me my liberty? Think ye it is because of the affection she
bears me? Nay verily, it is only because of the hindrance my presence
offers to the execution of her base designs. And think not that it is her
belief that yours is better than ours that has led her to change her
religion; it is only because she knows that immodesty is more freely
practised in your country than in ours.” Then turning to Zoraida, while I
and another of the Christians held him fast by both arms, lest he should
do some mad act, he said to her, “Infamous girl, misguided maiden, whither
in thy blindness and madness art thou going in the hands of these dogs,
our natural enemies? Cursed be the hour when I begot thee! Cursed the
luxury and indulgence in which I reared thee!”
</p>
<p>
But seeing that he was not likely soon to cease I made haste to put him on
shore, and thence he continued his maledictions and lamentations aloud;
calling on Mohammed to pray to Allah to destroy us, to confound us, to
make an end of us; and when, in consequence of having made sail, we could
no longer hear what he said we could see what he did; how he plucked out
his beard and tore his hair and lay writhing on the ground. But once he
raised his voice to such a pitch that we were able to hear what he said.
“Come back, dear daughter, come back to shore; I forgive thee all; let
those men have the money, for it is theirs now, and come back to comfort
thy sorrowing father, who will yield up his life on this barren strand if
thou dost leave him.”
</p>
<p>
<br><br><br><br> <a id="c41e"></a>
</p>
<div class="fig" style="width:60%;">

<br><br><br>
</p>
<p>
All this Zoraida heard, and heard with sorrow and tears, and all she could
say in answer was, “Allah grant that Lela Marien, who has made me become a
Christian, give thee comfort in thy sorrow, my father. Allah knows that I
could not do otherwise than I have done, and that these Christians owe
nothing to my will; for even had I wished not to accompany them, but
remain at home, it would have been impossible for me, so eagerly did my
soul urge me on to the accomplishment of this purpose, which I feel to be
as righteous as to thee, dear father, it seems wicked.”
</p>
<p>
But neither could her father hear her nor we see him when she said this;
and so, while I consoled Zoraida, we turned our attention to our voyage,
in which a breeze from the right point so favoured us that we made sure of
finding ourselves off the coast of Spain on the morrow by daybreak. But,
as good seldom or never comes pure and unmixed, without being attended or
followed by some disturbing evil that gives a shock to it, our fortune, or
perhaps the curses which the Moor had hurled at his daughter (for whatever
kind of father they may come from these are always to be dreaded), brought
it about that when we were now in mid-sea, and the night about three hours
spent, as we were running with all sail set and oars lashed, for the
favouring breeze saved us the trouble of using them, we saw by the light
of the moon, which shone brilliantly, a square-rigged vessel in full sail
close to us, luffing up and standing across our course, and so close that
we had to strike sail to avoid running foul of her, while they too put the
helm hard up to let us pass. They came to the side of the ship to ask who
we were, whither we were bound, and whence we came, but as they asked this
in French our renegade said, “Let no one answer, for no doubt these are
French corsairs who plunder all comers.”
</p>
<p>
<br><br><br><br> <a id="c41f"></a>
</p>
<div class="fig" style="width:60%;">

<br><br><br>
</p>
<p>
Acting on this warning no one answered a word, but after we had gone a
little ahead, and the vessel was now lying to leeward, suddenly they fired
two guns, and apparently both loaded with chain-shot, for with one they
cut our mast in half and brought down both it and the sail into the sea,
and the other, discharged at the same moment, sent a ball into our vessel
amidships, staving her in completely, but without doing any further
damage. We, however, finding ourselves sinking began to shout for help and
call upon those in the ship to pick us up as we were beginning to fill.
They then lay to, and lowering a skiff or boat, as many as a dozen
Frenchmen, well armed with match-locks, and their matches burning, got
into it and came alongside; and seeing how few we were, and that our
vessel was going down, they took us in, telling us that this had come to
us through our incivility in not giving them an answer. Our renegade took
the trunk containing Zoraida’s wealth and dropped it into the sea without
anyone perceiving what he did. In short we went on board with the
Frenchmen, who, after having ascertained all they wanted to know about us,
rifled us of everything we had, as if they had been our bitterest enemies,
and from Zoraida they took even the anklets she wore on her feet; but the
distress they caused her did not distress me so much as the fear I was in
that from robbing her of her rich and precious jewels they would proceed
to rob her of the most precious jewel that she valued more than all. The
desires, however, of those people do not go beyond money, but of that
their covetousness is insatiable, and on this occasion it was carried to
such a pitch that they would have taken even the clothes we wore as
captives if they had been worth anything to them. It was the advice of
some of them to throw us all into the sea wrapped up in a sail; for their
purpose was to trade at some of the ports of Spain, giving themselves out
as Bretons, and if they brought us alive they would be punished as soon as
the robbery was discovered; but the captain (who was the one who had
plundered my beloved Zoraida) said he was satisfied with the prize he had
got, and that he would not touch at any Spanish port, but pass the Straits
of Gibraltar by night, or as best he could, and make for La Rochelle, from
which he had sailed. So they agreed by common consent to give us the skiff
belonging to their ship and all we required for the short voyage that
remained to us, and this they did the next day on coming in sight of the
Spanish coast, with which, and the joy we felt, all our sufferings and
miseries were as completely forgotten as if they had never been endured by
us, such is the delight of recovering lost liberty.
</p>
<p>
It may have been about mid-day when they placed us in the boat, giving us
two kegs of water and some biscuit; and the captain, moved by I know not
what compassion, as the lovely Zoraida was about to embark, gave her some
forty gold crowns, and would not permit his men to take from her those
same garments which she has on now. We got into the boat, returning them
thanks for their kindness to us, and showing ourselves grateful rather
than indignant. They stood out to sea, steering for the straits; we,
without looking to any compass save the land we had before us, set
ourselves to row with such energy that by sunset we were so near that we
might easily, we thought, land before the night was far advanced. But as
the moon did not show that night, and the sky was clouded, and as we knew
not whereabouts we were, it did not seem to us a prudent thing to make for
the shore, as several of us advised, saying we ought to run ourselves
ashore even if it were on rocks and far from any habitation, for in this
way we should be relieved from the apprehensions we naturally felt of the
prowling vessels of the Tetuan corsairs, who leave Barbary at nightfall
and are on the Spanish coast by daybreak, where they commonly take some
prize, and then go home to sleep in their own houses. But of the
conflicting counsels the one which was adopted was that we should approach
gradually, and land where we could if the sea were calm enough to permit
us. This was done, and a little before midnight we drew near to the foot
of a huge and lofty mountain, not so close to the sea but that it left a
narrow space on which to land conveniently. We ran our boat up on the
sand, and all sprang out and kissed the ground, and with tears of joyful
satisfaction returned thanks to God our Lord for all his incomparable
goodness to us on our voyage. We took out of the boat the provisions it
contained, and drew it up on the shore, and then climbed a long way up the
mountain, for even there we could not feel easy in our hearts, or persuade
ourselves that it was Christian soil that was now under our feet.

The dawn came, more slowly, I think, than we could have wished; we
completed the ascent in order to see if from the summit any habitation or
any shepherds’ huts could be discovered, but strain our eyes as we might,
neither dwelling, nor human being, nor path nor road could we perceive.
However, we determined to push on farther, as it could not but be that ere
long we must see someone who could tell us where we were. But what
distressed me most was to see Zoraida going on foot over that rough
ground; for though I once carried her on my shoulders, she was more
wearied by my weariness than rested by the rest; and so she would never
again allow me to undergo the exertion, and went on very patiently and
cheerfully, while I led her by the hand. We had gone rather less than a
quarter of a league when the sound of a little bell fell on our ears, a
clear proof that there were flocks hard by, and looking about carefully to
see if any were within view, we observed a young shepherd tranquilly and
unsuspiciously trimming a stick with his knife at the foot of a cork tree.
“Egad, master,” said Sancho, “if we have no other proof of our case than
We called to him, and he, raising his head, sprang nimbly to his feet,
for, as we afterwards learned, the first who presented themselves to his
sight were the renegade and Zoraida, and seeing them in Moorish dress he
imagined that all the Moors of Barbary were upon him; and plunging with
marvellous swiftness into the thicket in front of him, he began to raise a
prodigious outcry, exclaiming, “The Moors—the Moors have landed! To
arms, to arms!” We were all thrown into perplexity by these cries, not
knowing what to do; but reflecting that the shouts of the shepherd would
raise the country and that the mounted coast-guard would come at once to
see what was the matter, we agreed that the renegade must strip off his
Turkish garments and put on a captive’s jacket or coat which one of our
party gave him at once, though he himself was reduced to his shirt; and so
commending ourselves to God, we followed the same road which we saw the
shepherd take, expecting every moment that the coast-guard would be down
upon us. Nor did our expectation deceive us, for two hours had not passed
when, coming out of the brushwood into the open ground, we perceived some
fifty mounted men swiftly approaching us at a hand-gallop. As soon as we
saw them we stood still, waiting for them; but as they came close and,
instead of the Moors they were in quest of, saw a set of poor Christians,
they were taken aback, and one of them asked if it could be we who were
the cause of the shepherd having raised the call to arms. I said “Yes,”
and as I was about to explain to him what had occurred, and whence we came
and who we were, one of the Christians of our party recognised the
horseman who had put the question to us, and before I could say anything
more he exclaimed:
</p>
<p>
“Thanks be to God, sirs, for bringing us to such good quarters; for, if I
do not deceive myself, the ground we stand on is that of Velez Malaga
unless, indeed, all my years of captivity have made me unable to recollect
that you, señor, who ask who we are, are Pedro de Bustamante, my uncle.”
</p>
<p>
The Christian captive had hardly uttered these words, when the horseman
threw himself off his horse, and ran to embrace the young man, crying:
</p>
<p>
“Nephew of my soul and life! I recognise thee now; and long have I mourned
thee as dead, I, and my sister, thy mother, and all thy kin that are still
alive, and whom God has been pleased to preserve that they may enjoy the
happiness of seeing thee. We knew long since that thou wert in Algiers,
and from the appearance of thy garments and those of all this company, I
conclude that ye have had a miraculous restoration to liberty.”
</p>
<p>
“It is true,” replied the young man, “and by-and-by we will tell you all.”
</p>
<p>
As soon as the horsemen understood that we were Christian captives, they
dismounted from their horses, and each offered his to carry us to the city
of Velez Malaga, which was a league and a half distant. Some of them went
to bring the boat to the city, we having told them where we had left it;
others took us up behind them, and Zoraida was placed on the horse of the
young man’s uncle. The whole town came out to meet us, for they had by
this time heard of our arrival from one who had gone on in advance. They
were not astonished to see liberated captives or captive Moors, for people
on that coast are well used to see both one and the other; but they were
astonished at the beauty of Zoraida, which was just then heightened, as
well by the exertion of travelling as by joy at finding herself on
Christian soil, and relieved of all fear of being lost; for this had
brought such a glow upon her face, that unless my affection for her were
deceiving me, I would venture to say that there was not a more beautiful
creature in the world—at least, that I had ever seen. We went
straight to the church to return thanks to God for the mercies we had
received, and when Zoraida entered it she said there were faces there like
Lela Marien’s. We told her they were her images; and as well as he could
the renegade explained to her what they meant, that she might adore them
as if each of them were the very same Lela Marien that had spoken to her;
and she, having great intelligence and a quick and clear instinct,
understood at once all he said to her about them. Thence they took us away
and distributed us all in different houses in the town; but as for the
renegade, Zoraida, and myself, the Christian who came with us brought us
to the house of his parents, who had a fair share of the gifts of fortune,
and treated us with as much kindness as they did their own son.
</p>
<p>
We remained six days in Velez, at the end of which the renegade, having
informed himself of all that was requisite for him to do, set out for the
city of Granada to restore himself to the sacred bosom of the Church
through the medium of the Holy Inquisition. The other released captives
took their departures, each the way that seemed best to him, and Zoraida
and I were left alone, with nothing more than the crowns which the
courtesy of the Frenchman had bestowed upon Zoraida, out of which I bought
the beast on which she rides; and, I for the present attending her as her
father and squire and not as her husband, we are now going to ascertain if
my father is living, or if any of my brothers has had better fortune than
mine has been; though, as Heaven has made me the companion of Zoraida, I
think no other lot could be assigned to me, however happy, that I would
rather have. The patience with which she endures the hardships that
poverty brings with it, and the eagerness she shows to become a Christian,
are such that they fill me with admiration, and bind me to serve her all
my life; though the happiness I feel in seeing myself hers, and her mine,
is disturbed and marred by not knowing whether I shall find any corner to
shelter her in my own country, or whether time and death may not have made
such changes in the fortunes and lives of my father and brothers, that I
shall hardly find anyone who knows me, if they are not alive.
</p>
<p>
I have no more of my story to tell you, gentlemen; whether it be an
interesting or a curious one let your better judgments decide; all I can
say is I would gladly have told it to you more briefly; although my fear
of wearying you has made me leave out more than one circumstance.

With these words the captive held his peace, and Don Fernando said to him,
“In truth, captain, the manner in which you have related this remarkable
adventure has been such as befitted the novelty and strangeness of the
matter. The whole story is curious and uncommon, and abounds with
incidents that fill the hearers with wonder and astonishment; and so great
is the pleasure we have found in listening to it that we should be glad if
it were to begin again, even though to-morrow were to find us still
occupied with the same tale.” And while he said this Cardenio and the rest
of them offered to be of service to him in any way that lay in their
power, and in words and language so kindly and sincere that the captain
was much gratified by their good-will. In particular Don Fernando offered,
if he would go back with him, to get his brother the marquis to become
godfather at the baptism of Zoraida, and on his own part to provide him
with the means of making his appearance in his own country with the credit
and comfort he was entitled to. For all this the captive returned thanks
very courteously, although he would not accept any of their generous
offers.
</p>
<p>
By this time night closed in, and as it did, there came up to the inn a
coach attended by some men on horseback, who demanded accommodation; to
which the landlady replied that there was not a hand’s breadth of the
whole inn unoccupied.
</p>
<p>
“Still, for all that,” said one of those who had entered on horseback,
“room must be found for his lordship the Judge here.”
</p>
<p>
At this name the landlady was taken aback, and said, “Señor, the fact is I
have no beds; but if his lordship the Judge carries one with him, as no
doubt he does, let him come in and welcome; for my husband and I will give
up our room to accommodate his worship.”
</p>
<p>
“Very good, so be it,” said the squire; but in the meantime a man had got
out of the coach whose dress indicated at a glance the office and post he
held, for the long robe with ruffled sleeves that he wore showed that he
was, as his servant said, a Judge of appeal. He led by the hand a young
girl in a travelling dress, apparently about sixteen years of age, and of
such a high-bred air, so beautiful and so graceful, that all were filled
with admiration when she made her appearance, and but for having seen
Dorothea, Luscinda, and Zoraida, who were there in the inn, they would
have fancied that a beauty like that of this maiden’s would have been hard
to find. Don Quixote was present at the entrance of the Judge with the
young lady, and as soon as he saw him he said, “Your worship may with
confidence enter and take your ease in this castle; for though the
accommodation be scanty and poor, there are no quarters so cramped or
inconvenient that they cannot make room for arms and letters; above all if
arms and letters have beauty for a guide and leader, as letters
represented by your worship have in this fair maiden, to whom not only
ought castles to throw themselves open and yield themselves up, but rocks
should rend themselves asunder and mountains divide and bow themselves
down to give her a reception. Enter, your worship, I say, into this
paradise, for here you will find stars and suns to accompany the heaven
your worship brings with you, here you will find arms in their supreme
excellence, and beauty in its highest perfection.”
</p>
<p>
The Judge was struck with amazement at the language of Don Quixote, whom
he scrutinized very carefully, no less astonished by his figure than by
his talk; and before he could find words to answer him he had a fresh
surprise, when he saw opposite to him Luscinda, Dorothea, and Zoraida,
who, having heard of the new guests and of the beauty of the young lady,
had come to see her and welcome her; Don Fernando, Cardenio, and the
curate, however, greeted him in a more intelligible and polished style. In
short, the Judge made his entrance in a state of bewilderment, as well
with what he saw as what he heard, and the fair ladies of the inn gave the
fair damsel a cordial welcome. On the whole he could perceive that all who
were there were people of quality; but with the figure, countenance, and
bearing of Don Quixote he was at his wits’ end; and all civilities having
been exchanged, and the accommodation of the inn inquired into, it was
settled, as it had been before settled, that all the women should retire
to the garret that has been already mentioned, and that the men should
alone was fuming at the lateness of the hour for retiring to rest; and he
remain outside as if to guard them; the Judge, therefore, was very well
pleased to allow his daughter, for such the damsel was, to go with the
ladies, which she did very willingly; and with part of the host’s narrow
bed and half of what the Judge had brought with him, they made a more
comfortable arrangement for the night than they had expected.
</p>
<p>
The captive, whose heart had leaped within him the instant he saw the
Judge, telling him somehow that this was his brother, asked one of the
servants who accompanied him what his name was, and whether he knew from
what part of the country he came. The servant replied that he was called
the Licentiate Juan Perez de Viedma, and that he had heard it said he came
from a village in the mountains of Leon. From this statement, and what he
himself had seen, he felt convinced that this was his brother who had
adopted letters by his father’s advice; and excited and rejoiced, he
called Don Fernando and Cardenio and the curate aside, and told them how
the matter stood, assuring them that the judge was his brother. The
servant had further informed him that he was now going to the Indies with
the appointment of Judge of the Supreme Court of Mexico; and he had
learned, likewise, that the young lady was his daughter, whose mother had
died in giving birth to her, and that he was very rich in consequence of
the dowry left to him with the daughter. He asked their advice as to what
means he should adopt to make himself known, or to ascertain beforehand
whether, when he had made himself known, his brother, seeing him so poor,
would be ashamed of him, or would receive him with a warm heart.
</p>
<p>
“Leave it to me to find out that,” said the curate; “though there is no
reason for supposing, señor captain, that you will not be kindly received,
because the worth and wisdom that your brother’s bearing shows him to
possess do not make it likely that he will prove haughty or insensible, or
that he will not know how to estimate the accidents of fortune at their
proper value.”
</p>
<p>
“Still,” said the captain, “I would not make myself known abruptly, but in
some indirect way.”
</p>
<p>
“I have told you already,” said the curate, “that I will manage it in a
way to satisfy us all.”
</p>
<p>
By this time supper was ready, and they all took their seats at the table,
except the captive, and the ladies, who supped by themselves in their own
room. In the middle of supper the curate said:
</p>
<p>
“I had a comrade of your worship’s name, Señor Judge, in Constantinople,
where I was a captive for several years, and that same comrade was one of
the stoutest soldiers and captains in the whole Spanish infantry; but he
had as large a share of misfortune as he had of gallantry and courage.”
</p>
<p>
“And how was the captain called, señor?” asked the Judge.
</p>
<p>
“He was called Ruy Perez de Viedma,” replied the curate, “and he was born
in a village in the mountains of Leon; and he mentioned a circumstance
connected with his father and his brothers which, had it not been told me
by so truthful a man as he was, I should have set down as one of those
fables the old women tell over the fire in winter; for he said his father
had divided his property among his three sons and had addressed words of
advice to them sounder than any of Cato’s. But I can say this much, that
the choice he made of going to the wars was attended with such success,
that by his gallant conduct and courage, and without any help save his own
merit, he rose in a few years to be captain of infantry, and to see
himself on the high-road and in position to be given the command of a
corps before long; but Fortune was against him, for where he might have
expected her favour he lost it, and with it his liberty, on that glorious
day when so many recovered theirs, at the battle of Lepanto. I lost mine
at the Goletta, and after a variety of adventures we found ourselves
comrades at Constantinople. Thence he went to Algiers, where he met with
one of the most extraordinary adventures that ever befell anyone in the
world.”
</p>
<p>
Here the curate went on to relate briefly his brother’s adventure with
Zoraida; to all which the Judge gave such an attentive hearing that he
never before had been so much of a hearer. The curate, however, only went
so far as to describe how the Frenchmen plundered those who were in the
boat, and the poverty and distress in which his comrade and the fair Moor
were left, of whom he said he had not been able to learn what became of
them, or whether they had reached Spain, or been carried to France by the
Frenchmen.
</p>
<p>
The captain, standing a little to one side, was listening to all the
curate said, and watching every movement of his brother, who, as soon as
he perceived the curate had made an end of his story, gave a deep sigh and
said with his eyes full of tears, “Oh, señor, if you only knew what news
you have given me and how it comes home to me, making me show how I feel
it with these tears that spring from my eyes in spite of all my worldly
wisdom and self-restraint! That brave captain that you speak of is my
eldest brother, who, being of a bolder and loftier mind than my other
brother or myself, chose the honourable and worthy calling of arms, which
was one of the three careers our father proposed to us, as your comrade
mentioned in that fable you thought he was telling you. I followed that of
letters, in which God and my own exertions have raised me to the position
in which you see me. My second brother is in Peru, so wealthy that with
what he has sent to my father and to me he has fully repaid the portion he
took with him, and has even furnished my father’s hands with the means of
gratifying his natural generosity, while I too have been enabled to pursue
my studies in a more becoming and creditable fashion, and so to attain my
present standing. My father is still alive, though dying with anxiety to
hear of his eldest son, and he prays God unceasingly that death may not
close his eyes until he has looked upon those of his son; but with regard
to him what surprises me is, that having so much common sense as he had,
he should have neglected to give any intelligence about himself, either in
his troubles and sufferings, or in his prosperity, for if his father or
any of us had known of his condition he need not have waited for that
miracle of the reed to obtain his ransom; but what now disquiets me is the
uncertainty whether those Frenchmen may have restored him to liberty, or
murdered him to hide the robbery. All this will make me continue my
journey, not with the satisfaction in which I began it, but in the deepest
melancholy and sadness. Oh dear brother! that I only knew where thou art
now, and I would hasten to seek thee out and deliver thee from thy
sufferings, though it were to cost me suffering myself! Oh that I could
bring news to our old father that thou art alive, even wert thou in the
deepest dungeon of Barbary; for his wealth and my brother’s and mine would
rescue thee thence! Oh beautiful and generous Zoraida, that I could repay
thy goodness to a brother! That I could be present at the new birth
of thy soul, and at thy bridal that would give us all such happiness!”
</p>
<p>
All this and more the Judge uttered with such deep emotion at the news he
had received of his brother that all who heard him shared in it, showing
their sympathy with his sorrow. The curate, seeing, then, how well he had
succeeded in carrying out his purpose and the captain’s wishes, had no
desire to keep them unhappy any longer, so he rose from the table and
going into the room where Zoraida was he took her by the hand, Luscinda,
Dorothea, and the Judge’s daughter following her. The captain was waiting
to see what the curate would do, when the latter, taking him with the
other hand, advanced with both of them to where the Judge and the other
gentlemen were and said, “Let your tears cease to flow, Señor Judge, and
the wish of your heart be gratified as fully as you could desire, for you
have before you your worthy brother and your good sister-in-law. He whom
you see here is the Captain Viedma, and this is the fair Moor who has been
so good to him. The Frenchmen I told you of have reduced them to the state
of poverty you see that you may show the generosity of your kind heart.”
</p>
<p>
The captain ran to embrace his brother, who placed both hands on his
breast so as to have a good look at him, holding him a little way off but
as soon as he had fully recognised him he clasped him in his arms so
closely, shedding such tears of heartfelt joy, that most of those present
could not but join in them. The words the brothers exchanged, the emotion
they showed can scarcely be imagined, I fancy, much less put down in
writing. They told each other in a few words the events of their lives;
they showed the true affection of brothers in all its strength; then the
judge embraced Zoraida, putting all he possessed at her disposal; then he
made his daughter embrace her, and the fair Christian and the lovely Moor
drew fresh tears from every eye. And there was Don Quixote observing all
these strange proceedings attentively without uttering a word, and
attributing the whole to chimeras of knight-errantry. Then they agreed
that the captain and Zoraida should return with his brother to Seville,
and send news to his father of his having been delivered and found, so as
to enable him to come and be present at the marriage and baptism of
Zoraida, for it was impossible for the Judge to put off his journey, as he
was informed that in a month from that time the fleet was to sail from
Seville for New Spain, and to miss the passage would have been a great
inconvenience to him. In short, everybody was well pleased and glad at the
captive’s good fortune; and as now almost two-thirds of the night were
past, they resolved to retire to rest for the remainder of it. Don Quixote
offered to mount guard over the castle lest they should be attacked by
some giant or other malevolent scoundrel, covetous of the great treasure
of beauty the castle contained. Those who understood him returned him
thanks for this service, and they gave the Judge an account of his
extraordinary humour, with which he was not a little amused. Sancho Panza
alone was fuming at the lateness of the hour for retiring to rest; and he
of all was the one that made himself most comfortable, as he stretched
himself on the trappings of his ass, which, as will be told farther on,
cost him so dear.
</p>
<p>
The ladies, then, having retired to their chamber, and the others having
disposed themselves with as little discomfort as they could, Don Quixote
sallied out of the inn to act as sentinel of the castle as he had
promised. It happened, however, that a little before the approach of dawn
a voice so musical and sweet reached the ears of the ladies that it forced
them all to listen attentively, but especially Dorothea, who had been
awake, and by whose side Doña Clara de Viedma, for so the Judge’s daughter
was called, lay sleeping. No one could imagine who it was that sang so
sweetly, and the voice was unaccompanied by any instrument. At one moment
it seemed to them as if the singer were in the courtyard, at another in
the stable; and as they were all attention, wondering, Cardenio came to
the door and said, “Listen, whoever is not asleep, and you will hear a
muleteer’s voice that enchants as it chants.”
</p>
<p>
“We are listening to it already, señor,” said Dorothea; on which Cardenio
went away; and Dorothea, giving all her attention to it, made out the
words of the song to be these:

<p class="poem">
Ah me, Love’s mariner am I<br>
On Love’s deep ocean sailing;<br>
I know not where the haven lies,<br>
I dare not hope to gain it.<br>
<br>
One solitary distant star<br>
Is all I have to guide me,<br>
A brighter orb than those of old<br>
That Palinurus lighted.<br>
<br>
And vaguely drifting am I borne,<br>
I know not where it leads me;<br>
I fix my gaze on it alone,<br>
Of all beside it heedless.<br>
<br>
But over-cautious prudery,<br>
And coyness cold and cruel,<br>
When most I need it, these, like clouds,<br>
Its longed-for light refuse me.<br>
<br>
Bright star, goal of my yearning eyes<br>
As thou above me beamest,<br>
When thou shalt hide thee from my sight<br>
I’ll know that death is near me.<br>
</p>
<p>
The singer had got so far when it struck Dorothea that it was not fair to
let Clara miss hearing such a sweet voice, so, shaking her from side to
side, she woke her, saying:
</p>
<p>
“Forgive me, child, for waking thee, but I do so that thou mayest have the
pleasure of hearing the best voice thou hast ever heard, perhaps, in all
thy life.”
</p>
<p>
Clara awoke quite drowsy, and not understanding at the moment what
Dorothea said, asked her what it was; she repeated what she had said, and
Clara became attentive at once; but she had hardly heard two lines, as the
singer continued, when a strange trembling seized her, as if she were
suffering from a severe attack of quartan ague, and throwing her arms
round Dorothea she said:
</p>
<p>
“Ah, dear lady of my soul and life! why did you wake me? The greatest
kindness fortune could do me now would be to close my eyes and ears so as
neither to see or hear that unhappy musician.”
</p>
<p>
“What art thou talking about, child?” said Dorothea. “Why, they say this
singer is a muleteer!”
</p>
<p>
“Nay, he is the lord of many places,” replied Clara, “and that one in my
heart which he holds so firmly shall never be taken from him, unless he be
willing to surrender it.”
</p>
<p>
Dorothea was amazed at the ardent language of the girl, for it seemed to
be far beyond such experience of life as her tender years gave any promise
of, so she said to her:
</p>
<p>
“You speak in such a way that I cannot understand you, Señora Clara;
explain yourself more clearly, and tell me what is this you are saying
about hearts and places and this musician whose voice has so moved you?
But do not tell me anything now; I do not want to lose the pleasure I get
from listening to the singer by giving my attention to your transports,
for I perceive he is beginning to sing a new strain and a new air.”
</p>
<p>
“Let him, in Heaven’s name,” returned Clara; and not to hear him she
stopped both ears with her hands, at which Dorothea was again surprised;
but turning her attention to the song she found that it ran in this
fashion:
</p>
<p class="poem">
Sweet Hope, my stay,<br>
That onward to the goal of thy intent<br>
Dost make thy way,<br>
Heedless of hindrance or impediment,<br>
Have thou no fear<br>
If at each step thou findest death is near.<br>
<br>
No victory,<br>
No joy of triumph doth the faint heart know;<br>
Unblest is he<br>
That a bold front to Fortune dares not show,<br>
But soul and sense<br>
In bondage yieldeth up to indolence.<br>
<br>
If Love his wares<br>
Do dearly sell, his right must be contest;<br>
What gold compares<br>
With that whereon his stamp he hath imprest?<br>
And all men know<br>
What costeth little that we rate but low.<br>
<br>
Love resolute<br>
Knows not the word “impossibility;”<br>
And though my suit<br>
Beset by endless obstacles I see,<br>
Yet no despair<br>
Shall hold me bound to earth while heaven is there.<br>
</p>
<p>
Here the voice ceased and Clara’s sobs began afresh, all which excited
Dorothea’s curiosity to know what could be the cause of singing so sweet
and weeping so bitter, so she again asked her what it was she was going to
say before. On this Clara, afraid that Luscinda might overhear her,
winding her arms tightly round Dorothea put her mouth so close to her ear
that she could speak without fear of being heard by anyone else, and said:
</p>
<p>
“This singer, dear señora, is the son of a gentleman of Aragon, lord of
two villages, who lives opposite my father’s house at Madrid; and though
my father had curtains to the windows of his house in winter, and
lattice-work in summer, in some way—I know not how—this
gentleman, who was pursuing his studies, saw me, whether in church or
elsewhere, I cannot tell, and, in fact, fell in love with me, and gave me
to know it from the windows of his house, with so many signs and tears
that I was forced to believe him, and even to love him, without knowing
what it was he wanted of me. One of the signs he used to make me was to
link one hand in the other, to show me he wished to marry me; and though I
should have been glad if that could be, being alone and motherless I knew
not whom to open my mind to, and so I left it as it was, showing him no
favour, except when my father, and his too, were from home, to raise the
curtain or the lattice a little and let him see me plainly, at which he
would show such delight that he seemed as if he were going mad. Meanwhile
the time for my father’s departure arrived, which he became aware of, but
not from me, for I had never been able to tell him of it. He fell sick, of
grief I believe, and so the day we were going away I could not see him to
take farewell of him, were it only with the eyes. But after we had been
two days on the road, on entering the posada of a village a day’s journey
from this, I saw him at the inn door in the dress of a muleteer, and so
well disguised, that if I did not carry his image graven on my heart it
would have been impossible for me to recognise him. But I knew him, and I
was surprised, and glad; he watched me, unsuspected by my father, from
whom he always hides himself when he crosses my path on the road, or in
the posadas where we halt; and, as I know what he is, and reflect that for
love of me he makes this journey on foot in all this hardship, I am ready
to die of sorrow; and where he sets foot there I set my eyes. I know not
with what object he has come; or how he could have got away from his
father, who loves him beyond measure, having no other heir, and because he
deserves it, as you will perceive when you see him. And moreover, I can
tell you, all that he sings is out of his own head; for I have heard them
say he is a great scholar and poet; and what is more, every time I see him
or hear him sing I tremble all over, and am terrified lest my father
should recognise him and come to know of our loves. I have never spoken a
word to him in my life; and for all that I love him so that I could not
live without him. This, dear señora, is all I have to tell you about the
musician whose voice has delighted you so much; and from it alone you
might easily perceive he is no muleteer, but a lord of hearts and towns,
as I told you already.”
</p>
<p>
“Say no more, Doña Clara,” said Dorothea at this, at the same time kissing
her a thousand times over, “say no more, I tell you, but wait till day
comes; when I trust in God to arrange this affair of yours so that it may
have the happy ending such an innocent beginning deserves.”
</p>
<p>
“Ah, señora,” said Doña Clara, “what end can be hoped for when his father
is of such lofty position, and so wealthy, that he would think I was not
fit to be even a servant to his son, much less wife? And as to marrying
without the knowledge of my father, I would not do it for all the world. I
would not ask anything more than that this youth should go back and leave
me; perhaps with not seeing him, and the long distance we shall have to
travel, the pain I suffer now may become easier; though I daresay the
remedy I propose will do me very little good. I don’t know how the devil
this has come about, or how this love I have for him got in; I such a
young girl, and he such a mere boy; for I verily believe we are both of an
age, and I am not sixteen yet; for I will be sixteen Michaelmas Day, next,
my father says.”
</p>
<p>
Dorothea could not help laughing to hear how like a child Doña Clara
spoke. “Let us go to sleep now, señora,” said she, “for the little of the
night that I fancy is left to us: God will soon send us daylight, and we
will set all to rights, or it will go hard with me.”
</p>
<p>
With this they fell asleep, and deep silence reigned all through the inn.
The only persons not asleep were the landlady’s daughter and her servant
Maritornes, who, knowing the weak point of Don Quixote’s humour, and that
he was outside the inn mounting guard in armour and on horseback,
resolved, the pair of them, to play some trick upon him, or at any rate to
amuse themselves for a while by listening to his nonsense. As it so
happened there was not a window in the whole inn that looked outwards
except a hole in the wall of a straw-loft through which they used to throw
out the straw. At this hole the two demi-damsels posted themselves, and
observed Don Quixote on his horse, leaning on his pike and from time to
time sending forth such deep and doleful sighs, that he seemed to pluck up
his soul by the roots with each of them; and they could hear him, too,
saying in a soft, tender, loving tone, “Oh my lady Dulcinea del Toboso,
perfection of all beauty, summit and crown of discretion, treasure house
of grace, depositary of virtue, and finally, ideal of all that is good,
honourable, and delectable in this world! What is thy grace doing now? Art
thou, perchance, mindful of thy enslaved knight who of his own free will
hath exposed himself to so great perils, and all to serve thee? Give me
tidings of her, oh luminary of the three faces! Perhaps at this moment,
envious of hers, thou art regarding her, either as she paces to and fro
some gallery of her sumptuous palaces, or leans over some balcony,
meditating how, whilst preserving her purity and greatness, she may
mitigate the tortures this wretched heart of mine endures for her sake,
what glory should recompense my sufferings, what repose my toil, and
lastly what death my life, and what reward my services? And thou, oh sun,
that art now doubtless harnessing thy steeds in haste to rise betimes and
come forth to see my lady; when thou seest her I entreat of thee to salute
her on my behalf: but have a care, when thou shalt see her and salute her,
that thou kiss not her face; for I shall be more jealous of thee than thou
wert of that light-footed ingrate that made thee sweat and run so on the
plains of Thessaly, or on the banks of the Peneus (for I do not exactly
recollect where it was thou didst run on that occasion) in thy jealousy
and love.”
</p>
<p>
Don Quixote had got so far in his pathetic speech when the landlady’s
daughter began to signal to him, saying, “Señor, come over here, please.”
</p>
<p>
At these signals and voice Don Quixote turned his head and saw by the
light of the moon, which then was in its full splendour, that someone was
calling to him from the hole in the wall, which seemed to him to be a
window, and what is more, with a gilt grating, as rich castles, such as he
believed the inn to be, ought to have; and it immediately suggested itself
to his imagination that, as on the former occasion, the fair damsel, the
daughter of the lady of the castle, overcome by love for him, was once
more endeavouring to win his affections; and with this idea, not to show
himself discourteous, or ungrateful, he turned Rocinante’s head and
approached the hole, and as he perceived the two wenches he said:
</p>
<p>
“I pity you, beauteous lady, that you should have directed your thoughts
of love to a quarter from whence it is impossible that such a return can
be made to you as is due to your great merit and gentle birth, for which
you must not blame this unhappy knight-errant whom love renders incapable
of submission to any other than her whom, the first moment his eyes beheld
her, he made absolute mistress of his soul. Forgive me, noble lady, and
retire to your apartment, and do not, by any further declaration of your
passion, compel me to show myself more ungrateful; and if, of the love you
bear me, you should find that there is anything else in my power wherein I
can gratify you, provided it be not love itself, demand it of me; for I
swear to you by that sweet absent enemy of mine to grant it this instant,
though it be that you require of me a lock of Medusa’s hair, which was all
snakes, or even the very beams of the sun shut up in a vial.”
</p>
<p>
“My mistress wants nothing of that sort, sir knight,” said Maritornes at
this.
</p>
<p>
“What then, discreet dame, is it that your mistress wants?” replied Don
Quixote.
</p>
<p>
“Only one of your fair hands,” said Maritornes, “to enable her to vent
over it the great passion, passion which has brought her to this loophole,
so much to the risk of her honour; for if the lord her father had heard
her, the least slice he would cut off her would be her ear.”
</p>
<p>
“I should like to see that tried,” said Don Quixote; “but he had better
beware of that, if he does not want to meet the most disastrous end that
ever father in the world met for having laid hands on the tender limbs of
a love-stricken daughter.”
</p>
<p>
All this Zoraida heard, and heard with sorrow and tears, and all she could
Maritornes felt sure that Don Quixote would present the hand she had
asked, and making up her mind what to do, she got down from the hole and
went into the stable, where she took the halter of Sancho Panza’s ass, and
in all haste returned to the hole, just as Don Quixote had planted himself
standing on Rocinante’s saddle in order to reach the grated window where
he supposed the lovelorn damsel to be; and giving her his hand, he said,
“Lady, take this hand, or rather this scourge of the evil-doers of the
earth; take, I say, this hand which no other hand of woman has ever
touched, not even hers who has complete possession of my entire body. I
present it to you, not that you may kiss it, but that you may observe the
contexture of the sinews, the close network of the muscles, the breadth
and capacity of the veins, whence you may infer what must be the strength
of the arm that has such a hand.”
</p>
<p>
“That we shall see presently,” said Maritornes, and making a running knot
on the halter, she passed it over his wrist and coming down from the hole
tied the other end very firmly to the bolt of the door of the straw-loft.
</p>
<p>
Don Quixote, feeling the roughness of the rope on his wrist, exclaimed,
“Your grace seems to be grating rather than caressing my hand; treat it
not so harshly, for it is not to blame for the offence my resolution has
given you, nor is it just to wreak all your vengeance on so small a part;
remember that one who loves so well should not revenge herself so
cruelly.”
</p>
<p>
But there was nobody now to listen to these words of Don Quixote’s, for as
soon as Maritornes had tied him she and the other made off, ready to die
with laughing, leaving him fastened in such a way that it was impossible
for him to release himself.
</p>
<p>
He was, as has been said, standing on Rocinante, with his arm passed
through the hole and his wrist tied to the bolt of the door, and in mighty
fear and dread of being left hanging by the arm if Rocinante were to stir
one side or the other; so he did not dare to make the least movement,
although from the patience and imperturbable disposition of Rocinante, he
had good reason to expect that he would stand without budging for a whole
century. Finding himself fast, then, and that the ladies had retired, he
began to fancy that all this was done by enchantment, as on the former
occasion when in that same castle that enchanted Moor of a carrier had
</p>
belaboured him; and he cursed in his heart his own want of sense and
judgment in venturing to enter the castle again, after having come off so
badly the first time; it being a settled point with knights-errant that
when they have tried an adventure, and have not succeeded in it, it is a
sign that it is not reserved for them but for others, and that therefore
they need not try it again. Nevertheless he pulled his arm to see if he
could release himself, but it had been made so fast that all his efforts
were in vain. It is true he pulled it gently lest Rocinante should move,
but try as he might to seat himself in the saddle, he had nothing for it
but to stand upright or pull his hand off. Then it was he wished for the
sword of Amadis, against which no enchantment whatever had any power; then
he cursed his ill fortune; then he magnified the loss the world would
sustain by his absence while he remained there enchanted, for that he
believed he was beyond all doubt; then he once more took to thinking of
his beloved Dulcinea del Toboso; then he called to his worthy squire
Sancho Panza, who, buried in sleep and stretched upon the pack-saddle of
his ass, was oblivious, at that moment, of the mother that bore him; then
he called upon the sages Lirgandeo and Alquife to come to his aid; then he
invoked his good friend Urganda to succour him; and then, at last, morning
found him in such a state of desperation and perplexity that he was
bellowing like a bull, for he had no hope that day would bring any relief
to his suffering, which he believed would last for ever, inasmuch as he
was enchanted; and of this he was convinced by seeing that Rocinante never
stirred, much or little, and he felt persuaded that he and his horse were
to remain in this state, without eating or drinking or sleeping, until the
malign influence of the stars was overpast, or until some other more sage
enchanter should disenchant him.
</p>
<p>
But he was very much deceived in this conclusion, for daylight had hardly
begun to appear when there came up to the inn four men on horseback, well
equipped and accoutred, with firelocks across their saddle-bows. They
called out and knocked loudly at the gate of the inn, which was still
shut; on seeing which, Don Quixote, even there where he was, did not
forget to act as sentinel, and said in a loud and imperious tone,
“Knights, or squires, or whatever ye be, ye have no right to knock at the
gates of this castle; for it is plain enough that they who are within are
either asleep, or else are not in the habit of throwing open the fortress
until the sun’s rays are spread over the whole surface of the earth.
Withdraw to a distance, and wait till it is broad daylight, and then we
shall see whether it will be proper or not to open to you.”
</p>
<p>
“What the devil fortress or castle is this,” said one, “to make us stand
on such ceremony? If you are the innkeeper bid them open to us; we are
travellers who only want to feed our horses and go on, for we are in
haste.”
</p>
<p>
“Do you think, gentlemen, that I look like an innkeeper?” said Don
Quixote.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know what you look like,” replied the other; “but I know that you
are talking nonsense when you call this inn a castle.”
</p>
<p>
“A castle it is,” returned Don Quixote, “nay, more, one of the best in
this whole province, and it has within it people who have had the sceptre
in the hand and the crown on the head.”
</p>
<p>
“It would be better if it were the other way,” said the traveller, “the
sceptre on the head and the crown in the hand; but if so, maybe there is
within some company of players, with whom it is a common thing to have
those crowns and sceptres you speak of; for in such a small inn as this,
and where such silence is kept, I do not believe any people entitled to
crowns and sceptres can have taken up their quarters.”
</p>
<p>
“You know but little of the world,” returned Don Quixote, “since you are
ignorant of what commonly occurs in knight-errantry.”
</p>
<p>
But the comrades of the spokesman, growing weary of the dialogue with Don
Quixote, renewed their knocks with great vehemence, so much so that the
host, and not only he but everybody in the inn, awoke, and he got up to
ask who knocked. It happened at this moment that one of the horses of the
four who were seeking admittance went to smell Rocinante, who melancholy,
dejected, and with drooping ears stood motionless, supporting his sorely
stretched master; and as he was, after all, flesh, though he looked as if
he were made of wood, he could not help giving way and in return smelling
the one who had come to offer him attentions. But he had hardly moved at
all when Don Quixote lost his footing; and slipping off the saddle, he
would have come to the ground, but for being suspended by the arm, which
caused him such agony that he believed either his wrist would be cut
through or his arm torn off; and he hung so near the ground that he could
just touch it with his feet, which was all the worse for him; for, finding
how little was wanted to enable him to plant his feet firmly, he struggled
and stretched himself as much as he could to gain a footing; just like
those undergoing the torture of the strappado, when they are fixed at
“touch and no touch,” who aggravate their own sufferings by their violent
efforts to stretch themselves, deceived by the hope which makes them fancy
that with a very little more they will reach the ground.

<p>
So loud, in fact, were the shouts of Don Quixote, that the landlord
opening the gate of the inn in all haste, came out in dismay, and ran to
see who was uttering such cries, and those who were outside joined him.
Maritornes, who had been by this time roused up by the same outcry,
suspecting what it was, ran to the loft and, without anyone seeing her,
untied the halter by which Don Quixote was suspended, and down he came to
the ground in the sight of the landlord and the travellers, who
approaching asked him what was the matter with him that he shouted so. He
without replying a word took the rope off his wrist, and rising to his
feet leaped upon Rocinante, braced his buckler on his arm, put his lance
in rest, and making a considerable circuit of the plain came back at a
half-gallop exclaiming:
</p>
<p>
“Whoever shall say that I have been enchanted with just cause, provided my
lady the Princess Micomicona grants me permission to do so, I give him the
lie, challenge him and defy him to single combat.”
</p>
<p>
The newly arrived travellers were amazed at the words of Don Quixote; but
the landlord removed their surprise by telling them who he was, and not to
mind him as he was out of his senses. They then asked the landlord if by
any chance a youth of about fifteen years of age had come to that inn, one
dressed like a muleteer, and of such and such an appearance, describing
that of Doña Clara’s lover. The landlord replied that there were so many
people in the inn he had not noticed the person they were inquiring for;
but one of them observing the coach in which the Judge had come, said, “He
is here no doubt, for this is the coach he is following: let one of us
stay at the gate, and the rest go in to look for him; or indeed it would
be as well if one of us went round the inn, lest he should escape over the
wall of the yard.” “So be it,” said another; and while two of them went
in, one remained at the gate and the other made the circuit of the inn;
observing all which, the landlord was unable to conjecture for what reason
they were taking all these precautions, though he understood they were
looking for the youth whose description they had given him.
</p>
<p>
It was by this time broad daylight; and for that reason, as well as in
consequence of the noise Don Quixote had made, everybody was awake and up,
but particularly Doña Clara and Dorothea; for they had been able to sleep
but badly that night, the one from agitation at having her lover so near
her, the other from curiosity to see him. Don Quixote, when he saw that
not one of the four travellers took any notice of him or replied to his
challenge, was furious and ready to die with indignation and wrath; and if
he could have found in the ordinances of chivalry that it was lawful for a
knight-errant to undertake or engage in another enterprise, when he had
plighted his word and faith not to involve himself in any until he had
made an end of the one to which he was pledged, he would have attacked the
whole of them, and would have made them return an answer in spite of
themselves. But considering that it would not become him, nor be right, to
begin any new emprise until he had established Micomicona in her kingdom,
he was constrained to hold his peace and wait quietly to see what would be
the upshot of the proceedings of those same travellers; one of whom found
the youth they were seeking lying asleep by the side of a muleteer,
without a thought of anyone coming in search of him, much less finding
him.
</p>
<p>
The man laid hold of him by the arm, saying, “It becomes you well indeed,
Señor Don Luis, to be in the dress you wear, and well the bed in which I
find you agrees with the luxury in which your mother reared you.”
</p>
<p>
The youth rubbed his sleepy eyes and stared for a while at him who held
him, but presently recognised him as one of his father’s servants, at
which he was so taken aback that for some time he could not find or utter
a word; while the servant went on to say, “There is nothing for it now,
Señor Don Luis, but to submit quietly and return home, unless it is your
wish that my lord, your father, should take his departure for the other
world, for nothing else can be the consequence of the grief he is in at
your absence.”
</p>
<p>
“But how did my father know that I had gone this road and in this dress?”
said Don Luis.
</p>
<p>
“It was a student to whom you confided your intentions,” answered the
servant, “that disclosed them, touched with pity at the distress he saw
your father suffer on missing you; he therefore despatched four of his
servants in quest of you, and here we all are at your service, better
pleased than you can imagine that we shall return so soon and be able to
restore you to those eyes that so yearn for you.”
</p>
<p>
“That shall be as I please, or as heaven orders,” returned Don Luis.
</p>
<p>
“What can you please or heaven order,” said the other, “except to agree to
go back? Anything else is impossible.”
</p>
<p>
All this conversation between the two was overheard by the muleteer at
whose side Don Luis lay, and rising, he went to report what had taken
place to Don Fernando, Cardenio, and the others, who had by this time
dressed themselves; and told them how the man had addressed the youth as
“Don,” and what words had passed, and how he wanted him to return to his
father, which the youth was unwilling to do. With this, and what they
already knew of the rare voice that heaven had bestowed upon him, they all
felt very anxious to know more particularly who he was, and even to help
him if it was attempted to employ force against him; so they hastened to
where he was still talking and arguing with his servant. Dorothea at this
instant came out of her room, followed by Doña Clara all in a tremor; and
calling Cardenio aside, she told him in a few words the story of the
musician and Doña Clara, and he at the same time told her what had
happened, how his father’s servants had come in search of him; but in
telling her so, he did not speak low enough but that Doña Clara heard what
he said, at which she was so much agitated that had not Dorothea hastened
to support her she would have fallen to the ground. Cardenio then bade
Dorothea return to her room, as he would endeavour to make the whole
matter right, and they did as he desired. All the four who had come in
quest of Don Luis had now come into the inn and surrounded him, urging him
to return and console his father at once and without a moment’s delay. He
replied that he could not do so on any account until he had concluded some
business in which his life, honour, and heart were at stake. The servants
pressed him, saying that most certainly they would not return without him,
and that they would take him away whether he liked it or not.
</p>
<p>
“You shall not do that,” replied Don Luis, “unless you take me dead;
though however you take me, it will be without life.”
</p>
<p>
By this time most of those in the inn had been attracted by the dispute,
but particularly Cardenio, Don Fernando, his companions, the Judge, the
curate, the barber, and Don Quixote; for he now considered there was no
necessity for mounting guard over the castle any longer. Cardenio being
already acquainted with the young man’s story, asked the men who wanted to
take him away, what object they had in seeking to carry off this youth
against his will.
</p>
<p>
“Our object,” said one of the four, “is to save the life of his father,
who is in danger of losing it through this gentleman’s disappearance.”
</p>
<p>
Upon this Don Luis exclaimed, “There is no need to make my affairs public
here; I am free, and I will return if I please; and if not, none of you
shall compel me.”
</p>
<p>
“Reason will compel your worship,” said the man, “and if it has no power
over you, it has power over us, to make us do what we came for, and what
it is our duty to do.”
</p>
<p>
“Let us hear what the whole affair is about,” said the Judge at this; but
the man, who knew him as a neighbour of theirs, replied, “Do you not know
this gentleman, Señor Judge? He is the son of your neighbour, who has run
away from his father’s house in a dress so unbecoming his rank, as your
worship may perceive.”
</p>
<p>
The judge on this looked at him more carefully and recognised him, and
embracing him said, “What folly is this, Señor Don Luis, or what can have
been the cause that could have induced you to come here in this way, and
in this dress, which so ill becomes your condition?”
</p>
<p>
Tears came into the eyes of the young man, and he was unable to utter a
word in reply to the Judge, who told the four servants not to be uneasy,
for all would be satisfactorily settled; and then taking Don Luis by the
hand, he drew him aside and asked the reason of his having come there.
</p>
<p>
But while he was questioning him they heard a loud outcry at the gate of
the inn, the cause of which was that two of the guests who had passed the
night there, seeing everybody busy about finding out what it was the four
men wanted, had conceived the idea of going off without paying what they
owed; but the landlord, who minded his own affairs more than other
people’s, caught them going out of the gate and demanded his reckoning,
abusing them for their dishonesty with such language that he drove them to
reply with their fists, and so they began to lay on him in such a style
that the poor man was forced to cry out, and call for help. The landlady
and her daughter could see no one more free to give aid than Don Quixote,
and to him the daughter said, “Sir knight, by the virtue God has given
you, help my poor father, for two wicked men are beating him to a mummy.”
</p>
<p>
To which Don Quixote very deliberately and phlegmatically replied, “Fair
damsel, at the present moment your request is inopportune, for I am
debarred from involving myself in any adventure until I have brought to a
happy conclusion one to which my word has pledged me; but that which I can
do for you is what I will now mention: run and tell your father to stand
his ground as well as he can in this battle, and on no account to allow
himself to be vanquished, while I go and request permission of the
Princess Micomicona to enable me to succour him in his distress; and if
she grants it, rest assured I will relieve him from it.”
</p>
<p>
“Sinner that I am,” exclaimed Maritornes, who stood by; “before you have
got your permission my master will be in the other world.”
</p>
<p>
“Give me leave, señora, to obtain the permission I speak of,” returned Don
Quixote; “and if I get it, it will matter very little if he is in the
other world; for I will rescue him thence in spite of all the same world
can do; or at any rate I will give you such a revenge over those who shall
have sent him there that you will be more than moderately satisfied;” and
without saying anything more he went and knelt before Dorothea, requesting
her Highness in knightly and errant phrase to be pleased to grant him
permission to aid and succour the castellan of that castle, who now stood
in grievous jeopardy. The princess granted it graciously, and he at once,
bracing his buckler on his arm and drawing his sword, hastened to the
inn-gate, where the two guests were still handling the landlord roughly;
but as soon as he reached the spot he stopped short and stood still,
though Maritornes and the landlady asked him why he hesitated to help
their master and husband.
</p>
<p>
“I hesitate,” said Don Quixote, “because it is not lawful for me to draw
sword against persons of squirely condition; but call my squire Sancho to
me; for this defence and vengeance are his affair and business.”
</p>
<p>
Thus matters stood at the inn-gate, where there was a very lively exchange
of fisticuffs and punches, to the sore damage of the landlord and to the
wrath of Maritornes, the landlady, and her daughter, who were furious when
they saw the pusillanimity of Don Quixote, and the hard treatment their
master, husband and father was undergoing. But let us leave him there; for
he will surely find someone to help him, and if not, let him suffer and
hold his tongue who attempts more than his strength allows him to do; and
let us go back fifty paces to see what Don Luis said in reply to the Judge
whom we left questioning him privately as to his reasons for coming on
foot and so meanly dressed.
</p>
<p>
To which the youth, pressing his hand in a way that showed his heart was
troubled by some great sorrow, and shedding a flood of tears, made answer:
</p>
<p>
“Señor, I have no more to tell you than that from the moment when, through
heaven’s will and our being near neighbours, I first saw Doña Clara, your
daughter and my lady, from that instant I made her the mistress of my
will, and if yours, my true lord and father, offers no impediment, this
very day she shall become my wife. For her I left my father’s house, and
for her I assumed this disguise, to follow her whithersoever she may go,
as the arrow seeks its mark or the sailor the pole-star. She knows nothing
more of my passion than what she may have learned from having sometimes
seen from a distance that my eyes were filled with tears. You know
already, señor, the wealth and noble birth of my parents, and that I am
their sole heir; if this be a sufficient inducement for you to venture to
make me completely happy, accept me at once as your son; for if my father,
influenced by other objects of his own, should disapprove of this
happiness I have sought for myself, time has more power to alter and
change things, than human will.”
</p>
<p>
With this the love-smitten youth was silent, while the Judge, after
hearing him, was astonished, perplexed, and surprised, as well at the
manner and intelligence with which Don Luis had confessed the secret of
his heart, as at the position in which he found himself, not knowing what
course to take in a matter so sudden and unexpected. All the answer,
therefore, he gave him was to bid him to make his mind easy for the
present, and arrange with his servants not to take him back that day, so
that there might be time to consider what was best for all parties. Don
Luis kissed his hands by force, nay, bathed them with his tears, in a way
that would have touched a heart of marble, not to say that of the Judge,
who, as a shrewd man, had already perceived how advantageous the marriage
would be to his daughter; though, were it possible, he would have
preferred that it should be brought about with the consent of the father
of Don Luis, who he knew looked for a title for his son.
</p>
<p>
The guests had by this time made peace with the landlord, for, by
persuasion and Don Quixote’s fair words more than by threats, they had
paid him what he demanded, and the servants of Don Luis were waiting for
the end of the conversation with the Judge and their master’s decision,
when the devil, who never sleeps, contrived that the barber, from whom Don
Quixote had taken Mambrino’s helmet, and Sancho Panza the trappings of his
ass in exchange for those of his own, should at this instant enter the
inn; which said barber, as he led his ass to the stable, observed Sancho
Panza engaged in repairing something or other belonging to the
pack-saddle; and the moment he saw it he knew it, and made bold to attack
Sancho, exclaiming, “Ho, sir thief, I have caught you! hand over my basin
and my pack-saddle, and all my trappings that you robbed me of.”
</p>
<p>
Sancho, finding himself so unexpectedly assailed, and hearing the abuse
poured upon him, seized the pack-saddle with one hand, and with the other
gave the barber a cuff that bathed his teeth in blood. The barber,
however, was not so ready to relinquish the prize he had made in the
pack-saddle; on the contrary, he raised such an outcry that everyone in
the inn came running to know what the noise and quarrel meant. “Here, in
the name of the king and justice!” he cried, “this thief and highwayman
wants to kill me for trying to recover my property.”
</p>
<p>
“You lie,” said Sancho, “I am no highwayman; it was in fair war my master
Don Quixote won these spoils.”
</p>
<p>
Don Quixote was standing by at the time, highly pleased to see his
squire’s stoutness, both offensive and defensive, and from that time forth
he reckoned him a man of mettle, and in his heart resolved to dub him a
knight on the first opportunity that presented itself, feeling sure that
the order of chivalry would be fittingly bestowed upon him.
</p>
<p>
In the course of the altercation, among other things the barber said,
“Gentlemen, this pack-saddle is mine as surely as I owe God a death, and I
know it as well as if I had given birth to it, and here is my ass in the
stable who will not let me lie; only try it, and if it does not fit him
like a glove, call me a rascal; and what is more, the same day I was
robbed of this, they robbed me likewise of a new brass basin, never yet
handselled, that would fetch a crown any day.”
</p>
<p>
At this Don Quixote could not keep himself from answering; and interposing
between the two, and separating them, he placed the pack-saddle on the
ground, to lie there in sight until the truth was established, and said,
“Your worships may perceive clearly and plainly the error under which this
worthy squire lies when he calls a basin which was, is, and shall be the
helmet of Mambrino which I won from him in fair war, and made myself master
of by legitimate and lawful possession. With the pack-saddle I do not
concern myself; but I may tell you on that head that my squire Sancho
asked my permission to strip off the caparison of this vanquished
poltroon’s steed, and with it adorn his own; I allowed him, and he took
it; and as to its having been changed from a caparison into a pack-saddle,
I can give no explanation except the usual one, that such transformations
will take place in adventures of chivalry. To confirm all which, run,
Sancho my son, and fetch hither the helmet which this good fellow calls a
basin.”
</p>
<p>
“Egad, master,” said Sancho, “if we have no other proof of our case than
what your worship puts forward, Mambrino’s helmet is just as much a basin
as this good fellow’s caparison is a pack-saddle.”
</p>
<p>
“Do as I bid thee,” said Don Quixote; “it cannot be that everything in
this castle goes by enchantment.”
</p>
<p>
Sancho hastened to where the basin was, and brought it back with him, and
when Don Quixote saw it, he took hold of it and said:
</p>
<p>
“Your worships may see with what a face this squire can assert that this
is a basin and not the helmet I told you of; and I swear by the order of
chivalry I profess, that this helmet is the identical one I took from him,
without anything added to or taken from it.”
</p>
<p>
“There is no doubt of that,” said Sancho, “for from the time
my master won it until now he has only fought one battle in it, when he let
loose those unlucky men in chains; and if it had not been for this basin-helmet
he would not have come off over well that time, for there was plenty of
stone-throwing in that affair.”

IN WHICH THE DOUBTFUL QUESTION OF MAMBRINO’S HELMET AND THE PACK-SADDLE IS

<p>
“What do you think now, gentlemen,” said the barber, “of what these
gentles say, when they want to make out that this is a helmet?”
</p>
<p>
“And whoever says the contrary,” said Don Quixote, “I will let him know he
lies if he is a knight, and if he is a squire that he lies again a
thousand times.”
</p>
<p>
Our own barber, who was present at all this, and understood Don Quixote’s
humour so thoroughly, took it into his head to back up his delusion and
carry on the joke for the general amusement; so addressing the other
barber he said:
</p>
<p>
“Señor barber, or whatever you are, you must know that I belong to your
profession too, and have had a licence to practise for more than twenty
years, and I know the implements of the barber craft, every one of them,
perfectly well; and I was likewise a soldier for some time in the days of
my youth, and I know also what a helmet is, and a morion, and a headpiece
with a visor, and other things pertaining to soldiering, I meant to say to
soldiers’ arms; and I say—saving better opinions and always with
submission to sounder judgments—that this piece we have now before
us, which this worthy gentleman has in his hands, not only is no barber’s
basin, but is as far from being one as white is from black, and truth from
falsehood; I say, moreover, that this, although it is a helmet, is not a
complete helmet.”
</p>
<p>
“Certainly not,” said Don Quixote, “for half of it is wanting, that is to
say the beaver.”
</p>
<p>
“It is quite true,” said the curate, who saw the object of his friend the
barber; and Cardenio, Don Fernando and his companions agreed with him, and
even the Judge, if his thoughts had not been so full of Don Luis’s affair,
would have helped to carry on the joke; but he was so taken up with the
serious matters he had on his mind that he paid little or no attention to
these facetious proceedings.
</p>
<p>
“God bless me!” exclaimed their butt the barber at this; “is it possible
that such an honourable company can say that this is not a basin but a
helmet? Why, this is a thing that would astonish a whole university,
however wise it might be! That will do; if this basin is a helmet, why,
then the pack-saddle must be a horse’s caparison, as this gentleman has
said.”
</p>
<p>
“To me it looks like a pack-saddle,” said Don Quixote; “but I have already
said that with that question I do not concern myself.”
</p>
<p>
“As to whether it be pack-saddle or caparison,” said the curate, “it is
only for Señor Don Quixote to say; for in these matters of chivalry all
these gentlemen and I bow to his authority.”
</p>
<p>
“By God, gentlemen,” said Don Quixote, “so many strange things have
happened to me in this castle on the two occasions on which I have
sojourned in it, that I will not venture to assert anything positively in
reply to any question touching anything it contains; for it is my belief
that everything that goes on within it goes by enchantment. The first
time, an enchanted Moor that there is in it gave me sore trouble, nor did
Sancho fare well among certain followers of his; and last night I was kept
hanging by this arm for nearly two hours, without knowing how or why I
came by such a mishap. So that now, for me to come forward to give an
opinion in such a puzzling matter, would be to risk a rash decision. As
regards the assertion that this is a basin and not a helmet I have already
given an answer; but as to the question whether this is a pack-saddle or a
caparison I will not venture to give a positive opinion, but will leave it
to your worships’ better judgment. Perhaps as you are not dubbed knights
like myself, the enchantments of this place have nothing to do with you,
and your faculties are unfettered, and you can see things in this castle
as they really and truly are, and not as they appear to me.”
</p>
<p>
“There can be no question,” said Don Fernando on this, “but that Señor Don
Quixote has spoken very wisely, and that with us rests the decision of
this matter; and that we may have surer ground to go on, I will take the
votes of the gentlemen in secret, and declare the result clearly and
fully.”
</p>
<p>
To those who were in on the secret of Don Quixote’s humour all this afforded
great amusement; but to those who knew nothing about it, it seemed the
greatest nonsense in the world, in particular to the four servants of Don
Luis, as well as to Don Luis himself, and to three other travellers who
had by chance come to the inn, and had the appearance of officers of the
Holy Brotherhood, as indeed they were; but the one who above all was at
his wits’ end was the barber whose basin, there before his very eyes, had been
turned into Mambrino’s helmet, and whose pack-saddle he had no doubt
whatever was about to become a rich caparison for a horse. All laughed to
see Don Fernando going from one to another collecting the votes, and
whispering to them to give him their private opinion whether the treasure
over which there had been so much fighting was a pack-saddle or a
caparison; but after he had taken the votes of those who knew Don Quixote,
he said aloud, “The fact is, my good fellow, that I am tired collecting
such a number of opinions, for I find that there is not one of whom I ask
what I desire to know, who does not tell me that it is absurd to say that
this is the pack-saddle of an ass, and not the caparison of a horse, nay,
of a thoroughbred horse; so you must submit, for, in spite of you and your
ass, this is a caparison and no pack-saddle, and you have stated and
proved your case very badly.”
</p>
<p>
“May I never share heaven,” said the poor barber, “if your worships are
not all mistaken; and may my soul appear before God as that appears to me
a pack-saddle and not a caparison; but, ‘laws go,’—I say no more;
and indeed I am not drunk, for I am fasting, except it be from sin.”
</p>
<p>
The simple talk of the barber did not afford less amusement than the
absurdities of Don Quixote, who now observed:
</p>
<p>
“There is no more to be done now than for each to take what belongs to
him, and to whom God has given it, may St. Peter add his blessing.”
</p>
<p>
But said one of the four servants, “Unless, indeed, this is a deliberate
joke, I cannot bring myself to believe that men so intelligent as those
present are, or seem to be, can venture to declare and assert that this is
not a basin, and that not a pack-saddle; but as I perceive that they do
assert and declare it, I can only come to the conclusion that there is
some mystery in this persistence in what is so opposed to the evidence of
experience and truth itself; for I swear by”—and here he rapped out
a round oath—“all the people in the world will not make me believe
that this is not a barber’s basin and that a jackass’s pack-saddle.”
</p>
<p>
“It might easily be a she-ass’s,” observed the curate.
</p>
<p>
“It is all the same,” said the servant; “that is not the point; but
whether it is or is not a pack-saddle, as your worships say.”
</p>
<p>
On hearing this one of the newly arrived officers of the Brotherhood, who
had been listening to the dispute and controversy, unable to restrain his
anger and impatience, exclaimed, “It is a pack-saddle as sure as my father
is my father, and whoever has said or will say anything else must be
drunk.”
</p>
<p>
“You lie like a rascally clown,” returned Don Quixote; and lifting his
pike, which he had never let out of his hand, he delivered such a blow at
his head that, had not the officer dodged it, it would have stretched him
at full length. The pike was shivered in pieces against the ground, and
the rest of the officers, seeing their comrade assaulted, raised a shout,
calling for help for the Holy Brotherhood. The landlord, who was of the
fraternity, ran at once to fetch his staff of office and his sword, and
ranged himself on the side of his comrades; the servants of Don Luis
clustered round him, lest he should escape from them in the confusion; the
barber, seeing the house turned upside down, once more laid hold of his
pack-saddle and Sancho did the same; Don Quixote drew his sword and
charged the officers; Don Luis cried out to his servants to leave him
alone and go and help Don Quixote, and Cardenio and Don Fernando, who were
supporting him; the curate was shouting at the top of his voice, the
landlady was screaming, her daughter was wailing, Maritornes was weeping,
Dorothea was aghast, Luscinda terror-stricken, and Doña Clara in a faint.
The barber cudgelled Sancho, and Sancho pommelled the barber; Don Luis
gave one of his servants, who ventured to catch him by the arm to keep him
from escaping, a cuff that bathed his teeth in blood; the Judge took his
part; Don Fernando had got one of the officers down and was belabouring
him heartily; the landlord raised his voice again calling for help for the
Holy Brotherhood; so that the whole inn was nothing but cries, shouts,
shrieks, confusion, terror, dismay, mishaps, sword-cuts, fisticuffs,
cudgellings, kicks, and bloodshed; and in the midst of all this chaos,
complication, and general entanglement, Don Quixote took it into his head
that he had been plunged into the thick of the discord of Agramante’s
camp; and, in a voice that shook the inn like thunder, he cried out:
</p>
<p>
“Hold all, let all sheathe their swords, let all be calm and attend to me
as they value their lives!”
</p>
<p>
All paused at his mighty voice, and he went on to say, “Did I not tell
you, sirs, that this castle was enchanted, and that a legion or so of
devils dwelt in it? In proof whereof I call upon you to behold with your
own eyes how the discord of Agramante’s camp has come hither, and been
transferred into the midst of us. See how they fight, there for the sword,
here for the horse, on that side for the eagle, on this for the helmet; we
are all fighting, and all at cross purposes. Come then, you, Señor Judge,
and you, señor curate; let the one represent King Agramante and the other
King Sobrino, and make peace among us; for by God Almighty it is a sorry
business that so many persons of quality as we are should slay one another
for such trifling cause.” The officers, who did not understand Don
Quixote’s mode of speaking, and found themselves roughly handled by Don
Fernando, Cardenio, and their companions, were not to be appeased; the
barber was, however, for both his beard and his pack-saddle were the worse
for the struggle; Sancho like a good servant obeyed the slightest word of
his master; while the four servants of Don Luis kept quiet when they saw
how little they gained by not being so. The landlord alone insisted upon
it that they must punish the insolence of this madman, who at every turn
raised a disturbance in the inn; but at length the uproar was stilled for
the present; the pack-saddle remained a caparison till the day of
judgment, and the basin a helmet and the inn a castle in Don Quixote’s
imagination.
</p>
<p>
All having been now pacified and made friends by the persuasion of the
Judge and the curate, the servants of Don Luis began again to urge him to
return with them at once; and while he was discussing the matter with
them, the Judge took counsel with Don Fernando, Cardenio, and the curate
as to what he ought to do in the case, telling them how it stood, and what
Don Luis had said to him. It was agreed at length that Don Fernando should
tell the servants of Don Luis who he was, and that it was his desire that
Don Luis should accompany him to Andalusia, where he would receive from
the marquis his brother the welcome his quality entitled him to; for,
otherwise, it was easy to see from the determination of Don Luis that he
would not return to his father at present, though they tore him to pieces.
On learning the rank of Don Fernando and the resolution of Don Luis the
four then settled it between themselves that three of them should return
to tell his father how matters stood, and that the other should remain to
wait upon Don Luis, and not leave him until they came back for him, or his
father’s orders were known. Thus by the authority of Agramante and the
wisdom of King Sobrino all this complication of disputes was arranged; but
the enemy of concord and hater of peace, feeling himself slighted and made
a fool of, and seeing how little he had gained after having involved them
all in such an elaborate entanglement, resolved to try his hand once more
by stirring up fresh quarrels and disturbances.
</p>
<p>
It came about in this wise: the officers were pacified on learning the
rank of those with whom they had been engaged, and withdrew from the
contest, considering that whatever the result might be they were likely to
get the worst of the battle; but one of them, the one who had been
thrashed and kicked by Don Fernando, recollected that among some warrants
he carried for the arrest of certain delinquents, he had one against Don
Quixote, whom the Holy Brotherhood had ordered to be arrested for setting
the galley slaves free, as Sancho had, with very good reason, apprehended.
Suspecting how it was, then, he wished to satisfy himself as to whether
Don Quixote’s features corresponded; and taking a parchment out of his
bosom he lit upon what he was in search of, and setting himself to read it
deliberately, for he was not a quick reader, as he made out each word he
fixed his eyes on Don Quixote, and went on comparing the description in
the warrant with his face, and discovered that beyond all doubt he was the
person described in it. As soon as he had satisfied himself, folding up
the parchment, he took the warrant in his left hand and with his right
seized Don Quixote by the collar so tightly that he did not allow him to
breathe, and shouted aloud, “Help for the Holy Brotherhood! and that you
may see I demand it in earnest, read this warrant which says this
highwayman is to be arrested.”
</p>
<p>
The curate took the warrant and saw that what the officer said was true,
and that it agreed with Don Quixote’s appearance, who, on his part, when
he found himself roughly handled by this rascally clown, worked up to the
highest pitch of wrath, and all his joints cracking with rage, with both
hands seized the officer by the throat with all his might, so that had he
not been helped by his comrades he would have yielded up his life ere Don
Quixote released his hold. The landlord, who had perforce to support his
brother officers, ran at once to aid them. The landlady, when she saw her
husband engaged in a fresh quarrel, lifted up her voice afresh, and its
note was immediately caught up by Maritornes and her daughter, calling
upon heaven and all present for help; and Sancho, seeing what was going
on, exclaimed, “By the Lord, it is quite true what my master says about
the enchantments of this castle, for it is impossible to live an hour in
peace in it!”
</p>
<p>
Don Fernando parted the officer and Don Quixote, and to their mutual
contentment made them relax the grip by which they held, the one the coat
collar, the other the throat of his adversary; for all this, however, the
officers did not cease to demand their prisoner and call on them to help,
years, and I know the implements of the barber craft, every one of them,
and deliver him over bound into their power, as was required for the
service of the King and of the Holy Brotherhood, on whose behalf they
again demanded aid and assistance to effect the capture of this robber and
footpad of the highways.
</p>
<p>
Don Quixote smiled when he heard these words, and said very calmly, “Come
now, base, ill-born brood; call ye it highway robbery to give freedom to
those in bondage, to release the captives, to succour the miserable, to
raise up the fallen, to relieve the needy? Infamous beings, who by your
vile grovelling intellects deserve that heaven should not make known to
you the virtue that lies in knight-errantry, or show you the sin and
ignorance in which ye lie when ye refuse to respect the shadow, not to say
the presence, of any knight-errant! Come now; band, not of officers, but
of thieves; footpads with the licence of the Holy Brotherhood; tell me who
was the ignoramus who signed a warrant of arrest against such a knight as
I am? Who was he that did not know that knights-errant are independent of
all jurisdictions, that their law is their sword, their charter their
prowess, and their edicts their will? Who, I say again, was the fool that
knows not that there are no letters patent of nobility that confer such
privileges or exemptions as a knight-errant acquires the day he is dubbed
a knight, and devotes himself to the arduous calling of chivalry? What
knight-errant ever paid poll-tax, duty, queen’s pin-money, king’s dues,
toll or ferry? What tailor ever took payment of him for making his
clothes? What castellan that received him in his castle ever made him pay
his shot? What king did not seat him at his table? What damsel was not
enamoured of him and did not yield herself up wholly to his will and
pleasure? And, lastly, what knight-errant has there been, is there, or
will there ever be in the world, not bold enough to give, single-handed,
four hundred cudgellings to four hundred officers of the Holy Brotherhood
if they come in his way?”

<a id="ch46"></a>CHAPTER XLVI.<br>
OF THE END OF THE NOTABLE ADVENTURE OF THE OFFICERS OF THE HOLY

<br><br><br>
</p>
<p>
While Don Quixote was talking in this strain, the curate was endeavouring
to persuade the officers that he was out of his senses, as they might
perceive by his deeds and his words, and that they need not press the
matter any further, for even if they arrested him and carried him off,
they would have to release him by-and-by as a madman; to which the holder
of the warrant replied that he had nothing to do with inquiring into Don
Quixote’s madness, but only to execute his superior’s orders, and that
once taken they might let him go three hundred times if they liked.
</p>
<p>
“For all that,” said the curate, “you must not take him away this time,
nor will he, it is my opinion, let himself be taken away.”
</p>
<p>
In short, the curate used such arguments, and Don Quixote did such mad
things, that the officers would have been more mad than he was if they had
not perceived his want of wits, and so they thought it best to allow
themselves to be pacified, and even to act as peacemakers between the
barber and Sancho Panza, who still continued their altercation with much
bitterness. In the end they, as officers of justice, settled the question
by arbitration in such a manner that both sides were, if not perfectly
contented, at least to some extent satisfied; for they changed the
pack-saddles, but not the girths or head-stalls; and as to Mambrino’s
helmet, the curate, under the rose and without Don Quixote’s knowing it,
paid eight reals for the basin, and the barber executed a full receipt and
engagement to make no further demand then or thenceforth for evermore,
amen. These two disputes, which were the most important and gravest, being
settled, it only remained for the servants of Don Luis to consent that
three of them should return while one was left to accompany him whither
Don Fernando desired to take him; and good luck and better fortune, having
already begun to solve difficulties and remove obstructions in favour of
the lovers and warriors of the inn, were pleased to persevere and bring
everything to a happy issue; for the servants agreed to do as Don Luis
wished; which gave Doña Clara such happiness that no one could have looked
into her face just then without seeing the joy of her heart. Zoraida,
though she did not fully comprehend all she saw, was grave or gay without
knowing why, as she watched and studied the various countenances, but
particularly her Spaniard’s, whom she followed with her eyes and clung to
with her soul. The gift and compensation which the curate gave the barber
had not escaped the landlord’s notice, and he demanded Don Quixote’s
reckoning, together with the amount of the damage to his wine-skins, and
the loss of his wine, swearing that neither Rocinante nor Sancho’s ass
should leave the inn until he had been paid to the very last farthing. The
curate settled all amicably, and Don Fernando paid; though the Judge had
also very readily offered to pay the score; and all became so peaceful and
quiet that the inn no longer reminded one of the discord of Agramante’s
camp, as Don Quixote said, but of the peace and tranquillity of the days
of Octavianus: for all which it was the universal opinion that their
thanks were due to the great zeal and eloquence of the curate, and to the
unexampled generosity of Don Fernando.
</p>
<p>
Finding himself now clear and quit of all quarrels, his squire’s as well
as his own, Don Quixote considered that it would be advisable to continue
the journey he had begun, and bring to a close that great adventure for
which he had been called and chosen; and with this high resolve he went
and knelt before Dorothea, who, however, would not allow him to utter a
word until he had risen; so to obey her he rose, and said, “It is a common
proverb, fair lady, that ‘diligence is the mother of good fortune,’ and
experience has often shown in important affairs that the earnestness of
the negotiator brings the doubtful case to a successful termination; but
in nothing does this truth show itself more plainly than in war, where
quickness and activity forestall the devices of the enemy, and win the
victory before the foe has time to defend himself. All this I say, exalted
and esteemed lady, because it seems to me that for us to remain any longer
in this castle now is useless, and may be injurious to us in a way that we
shall find out some day; for who knows but that your enemy the giant may
have learned by means of secret and diligent spies that I am going to
destroy him, and if the opportunity be given him he may seize it to
fortify himself in some impregnable castle or stronghold, against which
all my efforts and the might of my indefatigable arm may avail but little?
Therefore, lady, let us, as I say, forestall his schemes by our activity,
and let us depart at once in quest of fair fortune; for your highness is
only kept from enjoying it as fully as you could desire by my delay in
encountering your adversary.”
</p>
<p>
Don Quixote held his peace and said no more, calmly awaiting the reply of
the beauteous princess, who, with commanding dignity and in a style
adapted to Don Quixote’s own, replied to him in these words, “I give you
thanks, sir knight, for the eagerness you, like a good knight to whom it
is a natural obligation to succour the orphan and the needy, display to
afford me aid in my sore trouble; and heaven grant that your wishes and
mine may be realised, so that you may see that there are women in this
world capable of gratitude; as to my departure, let it be forthwith, for I
have no will but yours; dispose of me entirely in accordance with your
good pleasure; for she who has once entrusted to you the defence of her
person, and placed in your hands the recovery of her dominions, must not
think of offering opposition to that which your wisdom may ordain.”
</p>
<p>
“On, then, in God’s name,” said Don Quixote; “for, when a lady humbles
herself to me, I will not lose the opportunity of raising her up and
placing her on the throne of her ancestors. Let us depart at once, for the
common saying that in delay there is danger, lends spurs to my eagerness
to take the road; and as neither heaven has created nor hell seen any that
can daunt or intimidate me, saddle Rocinante, Sancho, and get ready thy
ass and the queen’s palfrey, and let us take leave of the castellan and
these gentlemen, and go hence this very instant.”
</p>
<p>
Sancho, who was standing by all the time, said, shaking his head, “Ah!
master, master, there is more mischief in the village than one hears of,
begging all good bodies’ pardon.”
</p>
<p>
“What mischief can there be in any village, or in all the cities of the
world, you booby, that can hurt my reputation?” said Don Quixote.
</p>
<p>
“If your worship is angry,” replied Sancho, “I will hold my tongue and
leave unsaid what as a good squire I am bound to say, and what a good
servant should tell his master.”
</p>
<p>
“Say what thou wilt,” returned Don Quixote, “provided thy words be not
meant to work upon my fears; for thou, if thou fearest, art behaving like
thyself; but I like myself, in not fearing.”
</p>
<p>
“It is nothing of the sort, as I am a sinner before God,” said Sancho,
“but that I take it to be sure and certain that this lady, who calls
herself queen of the great kingdom of Micomicon, is no more so than my
mother; for, if she was what she says, she would not go rubbing noses with
one that is here every instant and behind every door.”
</p>
<p>
Dorothea turned red at Sancho’s words, for the truth was that her husband
Don Fernando had now and then, when the others were not looking, gathered
from her lips some of the reward his love had earned, and Sancho seeing
this had considered that such freedom was more like a courtesan than a
queen of a great kingdom; she, however, being unable or not caring to
answer him, allowed him to proceed, and he continued, “This I say, señor,
because, if after we have travelled roads and highways, and passed bad
nights and worse days, one who is now enjoying himself in this inn is to
reap the fruit of our labours, there is no need for me to be in a hurry to
saddle Rocinante, put the pad on the ass, or get ready the palfrey; for it
will be better for us to stay quiet, and let every jade mind her spinning,
and let us go to dinner.”
</p>
<p>
Good God, what was the indignation of Don Quixote when he heard the
audacious words of his squire! So great was it, that in a voice
inarticulate with rage, with a stammering tongue, and eyes that flashed
living fire, he exclaimed, “Rascally clown, boorish, insolent, and
ignorant, ill-spoken, foul-mouthed, impudent backbiter and slanderer! Hast
thou dared to utter such words in my presence and in that of these
illustrious ladies? Hast thou dared to harbour such gross and shameless
thoughts in thy muddled imagination? Begone from my presence, thou born
monster, storehouse of lies, hoard of untruths, garner of knaveries,
inventor of scandals, publisher of absurdities, enemy of the respect due
to royal personages! Begone, show thyself no more before me under pain of
my wrath;” and so saying he knitted his brows, puffed out his cheeks,
gazed around him, and stamped on the ground violently with his right foot,
showing in every way the rage that was pent up in his heart; and at his
words and furious gestures Sancho was so scared and terrified that he
would have been glad if the earth had opened that instant and swallowed
him, and his only thought was to turn round and make his escape from the
angry presence of his master.
</p>
<p>
But the ready-witted Dorothea, who by this time so well understood Don
Quixote’s humour, said, to mollify his wrath, “Be not irritated at the
absurdities your good squire has uttered, Sir Knight of the Rueful
Countenance, for perhaps he did not utter them without cause, and from his
good sense and Christian conscience it is not likely that he would bear
false witness against anyone. We may therefore believe, without any
hesitation, that since, as you say, sir knight, everything in this castle
goes and is brought about by means of enchantment, Sancho, I say, may
possibly have seen, through this diabolical medium, what he says he saw so
much to the detriment of my modesty.”
</p>
<p>
“I swear by God Omnipotent,” exclaimed Don Quixote at this, “your highness
has hit the point; and that some vile illusion must have come before this
sinner of a Sancho, that made him see what it would have been impossible
to see by any other means than enchantments; for I know well enough, from
the poor fellow’s goodness and harmlessness, that he is incapable of
bearing false witness against anybody.”
</p>
<p>
“True, no doubt,” said Don Fernando, “for which reason, Señor
Don Quixote, you ought to forgive him and restore him to the bosom of your
favour, <i>sicut erat in principio</i>, before illusions of this sort had taken
away his senses.”
</p>
<p>
Don Quixote said he was ready to pardon him, and the curate went for
Sancho, who came in very humbly, and falling on his knees begged for the
hand of his master, who having presented it to him and allowed him to kiss
it, gave him his blessing and said, “Now, Sancho my son, thou wilt be
convinced of the truth of what I have many a time told thee, that
everything in this castle is done by means of enchantment.”
</p>
<p>
“So it is, I believe,” said Sancho, “except the affair of the blanket,
which came to pass in reality by ordinary means.”
</p>
<p>
“Believe it not,” said Don Quixote, “for had it been so, I would have
avenged thee that instant, or even now; but neither then nor now could I,
nor have I seen anyone upon whom to avenge thy wrong.”
</p>
<p>
They were all eager to know what the affair of the blanket was, and the
landlord gave them a minute account of Sancho’s flights, at which they
laughed not a little, and at which Sancho would have been no less out of
countenance had not his master once more assured him it was all
enchantment. For all that his simplicity never reached so high a pitch
that he could persuade himself it was not the plain and simple truth,
without any deception whatever about it, that he had been blanketed by
beings of flesh and blood, and not by visionary and imaginary phantoms, as
his master believed and protested.
</p>
<p>
The illustrious company had now been two days in the inn; and as it seemed
to them time to depart, they devised a plan so that, without giving
Dorothea and Don Fernando the trouble of going back with Don Quixote to
his village under pretence of restoring Queen Micomicona, the curate and
the barber might carry him away with them as they proposed, and the curate
be able to take his madness in hand at home; and in pursuance of their
plan they arranged with the owner of an oxcart who happened to be passing
that way to carry him after this fashion. They constructed a kind of cage
with wooden bars, large enough to hold Don Quixote comfortably; and then
Don Fernando and his companions, the servants of Don Luis, and the
officers of the Brotherhood, together with the landlord, by the directions
and advice of the curate, covered their faces and disguised themselves,
some in one way, some in another, so as to appear to Don Quixote quite
different from the persons he had seen in the castle. This done, in
profound silence they entered the room where he was asleep, taking his
rest after the past frays, and advancing to where he was sleeping
tranquilly, not dreaming of anything of the kind happening, they seized
him firmly and bound him fast hand and foot, so that, when he awoke
startled, he was unable to move, and could only marvel and wonder at the
strange figures he saw before him; upon which he at once gave way to the
idea which his crazed fancy invariably conjured up before him, and took it
into his head that all these shapes were phantoms of the enchanted castle,
and that he himself was unquestionably enchanted as he could neither move
nor help himself; precisely what the curate, the concoctor of the scheme,
expected would happen. Of all that were there Sancho was the only one who
was at once in his senses and in his own proper character, and he, though
he was within very little of sharing his master’s infirmity, did not fail
to perceive who all these disguised figures were; but he did not dare to
open his lips until he saw what came of this assault and capture of his
master; nor did the latter utter a word, waiting to the upshot of his
mishap; which was that bringing in the cage, they shut him up in it and
nailed the bars so firmly that they could not be easily burst open.

<p>
They then took him on their shoulders, and as they passed out of the room
an awful voice—as much so as the barber, not he of the pack-saddle
but the other, was able to make it—was heard to say, “O Knight of
the Rueful Countenance, let not this captivity in which thou art placed
afflict thee, for this must needs be, for the more speedy accomplishment
of the adventure in which thy great heart has engaged thee; the which
shall be accomplished when the raging Manchegan lion and the white Tobosan
dove shall be linked together, having first humbled their haughty necks to
the gentle yoke of matrimony. And from this marvellous union shall come
forth to the light of the world brave whelps that shall rival the ravening
claws of their valiant father; and this shall come to pass ere the pursuer
of the flying nymph shall in his swift natural course have twice visited
the starry signs. And thou, O most noble and obedient squire that ever
bore sword at side, beard on face, or nose to smell with, be not dismayed
or grieved to see the flower of knight-errantry carried away thus before
thy very eyes; for soon, if it so please the Framer of the universe, thou
shalt see thyself exalted to such a height that thou shalt not know
thyself, and the promises which thy good master has made thee shall not
prove false; and I assure thee, on the authority of the sage Mentironiana,
that thy wages shall be paid thee, as thou shalt see in due season. Follow
then the footsteps of the valiant enchanted knight, for it is expedient
that thou shouldst go to the destination assigned to both of you; and as
it is not permitted to me to say more, God be with thee; for I return to
that place I wot of;” and as he brought the prophecy to a close he raised
his voice to a high pitch, and then lowered it to such a soft tone, that
queen of a great kingdom; she, however, being unable or not caring to
even those who knew it was all a joke were almost inclined to take what
they heard seriously.
</p>
<p>
Don Quixote was comforted by the prophecy he heard, for he at once
comprehended its meaning perfectly, and perceived it was promised to him
that he should see himself united in holy and lawful matrimony with his
beloved Dulcinea del Toboso, from whose blessed womb should proceed the
whelps, his sons, to the eternal glory of La Mancha; and being thoroughly
and firmly persuaded of this, he lifted up his voice, and with a deep sigh
exclaimed, “Oh thou, whoever thou art, who hast foretold me so much good,
I implore of thee that on my part thou entreat that sage enchanter who
takes charge of my interests, that he leave me not to perish in this
captivity in which they are now carrying me away, ere I see fulfilled
promises so joyful and incomparable as those which have been now made me;
for, let this but come to pass, and I shall glory in the pains of my
prison, find comfort in these chains wherewith they bind me, and regard
this bed whereon they stretch me, not as a hard battle-field, but as a
soft and happy nuptial couch; and touching the consolation of Sancho
Panza, my squire, I rely upon his goodness and rectitude that he will not
desert me in good or evil fortune; for if, by his ill luck or mine, it may
not happen to be in my power to give him the island I have promised, or
any equivalent for it, at least his wages shall not be lost; for in my
will, which is already made, I have declared the sum that shall be paid to
him, measured, not by his many faithful services, but by the means at my
disposal.”
</p>
<p>
Sancho bowed his head very respectfully and kissed both his hands, for,
being tied together, he could not kiss one; and then the apparitions
lifted the cage upon their shoulders and fixed it upon the ox-cart.

When Don Quixote saw himself caged and hoisted on the cart in this way, he
said, “Many grave histories of knights-errant have I read; but never yet
have I read, seen, or heard of their carrying off enchanted knights-errant
in this fashion, or at the slow pace that these lazy, sluggish animals
promise; for they always take them away through the air with marvellous
swiftness, enveloped in a dark thick cloud, or on a chariot of fire, or it
may be on some hippogriff or other beast of the kind; but to carry me off
like this on an ox-cart! By God, it puzzles me! But perhaps the chivalry
and enchantments of our day take a different course from that of those in
days gone by; and it may be, too, that as I am a new knight in the world,
and the first to revive the already forgotten calling of
knight-adventurers, they may have newly invented other kinds of
enchantments and other modes of carrying off the enchanted. What thinkest
thou of the matter, Sancho my son?”
</p>
<p>
<br><br><br><br> <a id="c47b"></a>
</p>
<div class="fig" style="width:60%;">

<br><br><br>
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know what to think,” answered Sancho, “not being as well read as
your worship in errant writings; but for all that I venture to say and
swear that these apparitions that are about us are not quite catholic.”
</p>
<p>
“Catholic!” said Don Quixote. “Father of me! how can they be Catholic when
they are all devils that have taken fantastic shapes to come and do this,
and bring me to this condition? And if thou wouldst prove it, touch them,
and feel them, and thou wilt find they have only bodies of air, and no
consistency except in appearance.”
</p>
<p>
“By God, master,” returned Sancho, “I have touched them already; and that
devil, that goes about there so busily, has firm flesh, and another
property very different from what I have heard say devils have, for by all
accounts they all smell of brimstone and other bad smells; but this one
smells of amber half a league off.” Sancho was here speaking of Don
Fernando, who, like a gentleman of his rank, was very likely perfumed as
Sancho said.
</p>
<p>
“Marvel not at that, Sancho my friend,” said Don Quixote; “for let me tell
thee devils are crafty; and even if they do carry odours about with them,
they themselves have no smell, because they are spirits; or, if they have
any smell, they cannot smell of anything sweet, but of something foul and
fetid; and the reason is that as they carry hell with them wherever they
go, and can get no ease whatever from their torments, and as a sweet smell
is a thing that gives pleasure and enjoyment, it is impossible that they
can smell sweet; if, then, this devil thou speakest of seems to thee to
smell of amber, either thou art deceiving thyself, or he wants to deceive
thee by making thee fancy he is not a devil.”
</p>
<p>
Such was the conversation that passed between master and man; and Don
Fernando and Cardenio, apprehensive of Sancho’s making a complete
discovery of their scheme, towards which he had already gone some way,
resolved to hasten their departure, and calling the landlord aside, they
directed him to saddle Rocinante and put the pack-saddle on Sancho’s ass,
which he did with great alacrity. In the meantime the curate had made an
arrangement with the officers that they should bear them company as far as
his village, he paying them so much a day. Cardenio hung the buckler on
one side of the bow of Rocinante’s saddle and the basin on the other, and
by signs commanded Sancho to mount his ass and take Rocinante’s bridle,
and at each side of the cart he placed two officers with their muskets;
but before the cart was put in motion, out came the landlady and her
daughter and Maritornes to bid Don Quixote farewell, pretending to weep
with grief at his misfortune; and to them Don Quixote said:
</p>
<p>
“Weep not, good ladies, for all these mishaps are the lot of those who
follow the profession I profess; and if these reverses did not befall me I
should not esteem myself a famous knight-errant; for such things never
happen to knights of little renown and fame, because nobody in the world
thinks about them; to valiant knights they do, for these are envied for
their virtue and valour by many princes and other knights who compass the
destruction of the worthy by base means. Nevertheless, virtue is of
herself so mighty, that, in spite of all the magic that Zoroaster its
first inventor knew, she will come victorious out of every trial, and shed
her light upon the earth as the sun does upon the heavens. Forgive me,
fair ladies, if, through inadvertence, I have in aught offended you; for
intentionally and wittingly I have never done so to any; and pray to God
that he deliver me from this captivity to which some malevolent enchanter
has consigned me; and should I find myself released therefrom, the favours
that ye have bestowed upon me in this castle shall be held in memory by
me, that I may acknowledge, recognise, and requite them as they deserve.”
</p>
<p>
While this was passing between the ladies of the castle and Don Quixote,
the curate and the barber bade farewell to Don Fernando and his
companions, to the captain, his brother, and the ladies, now all made
happy, and in particular to Dorothea and Luscinda. They all embraced one
another, and promised to let each other know how things went with them,
and Don Fernando directed the curate where to write to him, to tell him
Castile a Count Fernan Gonzalez, Valencia a Cid, Andalusia a Gonzalo
what became of Don Quixote, assuring him that there was nothing that could
give him more pleasure than to hear of it, and that he too, on his part,
would send him word of everything he thought he would like to know, about
his marriage, Zoraida’s baptism, Don Luis’s affair, and Luscinda’s return
to her home. The curate promised to comply with his request carefully, and
they embraced once more, and renewed their promises.
</p>
<p>
The landlord approached the curate and handed him some papers, saying he
had discovered them in the lining of the valise in which the novel of “The
Ill-advised Curiosity” had been found, and that he might take them all
away with him as their owner had not since returned; for, as he could not
read, he did not want them himself. The curate thanked him, and opening
them he saw at the beginning of the manuscript the words, “Novel of
Rinconete and Cortadillo,” by which he perceived that it was a novel, and
as that of “The Ill-advised Curiosity” had been good he concluded this
would be so too, as they were both probably by the same author; so he kept
it, intending to read it when he had an opportunity. He then mounted and
his friend the barber did the same, both masked, so as not to be
recognised by Don Quixote, and set out following in the rear of the cart.
The order of march was this: first went the cart with the owner leading
it; at each side of it marched the officers of the Brotherhood, as has
been said, with their muskets; then followed Sancho Panza on his ass,
leading Rocinante by the bridle; and behind all came the curate and the
barber on their mighty mules, with faces covered, as aforesaid, and a
grave and serious air, measuring their pace to suit the slow steps of the
oxen. Don Quixote was seated in the cage, with his hands tied and his feet
stretched out, leaning against the bars as silent and as patient as if he
were a stone statue and not a man of flesh. Thus slowly and silently they
made, it might be, two leagues, until they reached a valley which the
carter thought a convenient place for resting and feeding his oxen, and he
said so to the curate, but the barber was of opinion that they ought to
push on a little farther, as at the other side of a hill which appeared
close by he knew there was a valley that had more grass and much better
than the one where they proposed to halt; and his advice was taken and
they continued their journey.
</p>
<p>
Just at that moment the curate, looking back, saw coming on behind them
six or seven mounted men, well found and equipped, who soon overtook them,
for they were travelling, not at the sluggish, deliberate pace of oxen,
but like men who rode canons’ mules, and in haste to take their noontide
rest as soon as possible at the inn which was in sight not a league off.
The quick travellers came up with the slow, and courteous salutations were
exchanged; and one of the new comers, who was, in fact, a canon of Toledo
and master of the others who accompanied him, observing the regular order
of the procession, the cart, the officers, Sancho, Rocinante, the curate
and the barber, and above all Don Quixote caged and confined, could not
help asking what was the meaning of carrying the man in that fashion;
though, from the badges of the officers, he already concluded that he must
be some desperate highwayman or other malefactor whose punishment fell
within the jurisdiction of the Holy Brotherhood. One of the officers to
whom he had put the question, replied, “Let the gentleman himself tell you
the meaning of his going this way, señor, for we do not know.”
</p>
<p>
Don Quixote overheard the conversation and said, “Haply, gentlemen, you
are versed and learned in matters of errant chivalry? Because if you are I
will tell you my misfortunes; if not, there is no good in my giving myself
the trouble of relating them;” but here the curate and the barber, seeing
that the travellers were engaged in conversation with Don Quixote, came
forward, in order to answer in such a way as to save their stratagem from
being discovered.
</p>
<p>
The canon, replying to Don Quixote, said, “In truth, brother, I know more
about books of chivalry than I do about Villalpando’s elements of logic;
so if that be all, you may safely tell me what you please.”
</p>
<p>
“In God’s name, then, señor,” replied Don Quixote; “if that be so, I would
have you know that I am held enchanted in this cage by the envy and fraud
of wicked enchanters; for virtue is more persecuted by the wicked than
loved by the good. I am a knight-errant, and not one of those whose names
Fame has never thought of immortalising in her record, but of those who,
in defiance and in spite of envy itself, and all the magicians that
Persia, or Brahmans that India, or Gymnosophists that Ethiopia ever
produced, will place their names in the temple of immortality, to serve as
examples and patterns for ages to come, whereby knights-errant may see the
footsteps in which they must tread if they would attain the summit and
crowning point of honour in arms.”
</p>
<p>
“What Señor Don Quixote of La Mancha says,” observed the curate, “is the
truth; for he goes enchanted in this cart, not from any fault or sins of
his, but because of the malevolence of those to whom virtue is odious and
valour hateful. This, señor, is the Knight of the Rueful Countenance, if
you have ever heard him named, whose valiant achievements and mighty deeds
shall be written on lasting brass and imperishable marble, notwithstanding
“Señor barber, or whatever you are, you must know that I belong to your
all the efforts of envy to obscure them and malice to hide them.”
</p>
<p>
When the canon heard both the prisoner and the man who was at liberty talk
in such a strain he was ready to cross himself in his astonishment, and
could not make out what had befallen him; and all his attendants were in
the same state of amazement.
</p>
<p>
At this point Sancho Panza, who had drawn near to hear the conversation,
said, in order to make everything plain, “Well, sirs, you may like or
dislike what I am going to say, but the fact of the matter is, my master,
Don Quixote, is just as much enchanted as my mother. He is in his full
senses, he eats and he drinks, and he has his calls like other men and as
he had yesterday, before they caged him. And if that’s the case, what do
they mean by wanting me to believe that he is enchanted? For I have heard
many a one say that enchanted people neither eat, nor sleep, nor talk; and
my master, if you don’t stop him, will talk more than thirty lawyers.”
Then turning to the curate he exclaimed, “Ah, señor curate, señor curate!
do you think I don’t know you? Do you think I don’t guess and see the
drift of these new enchantments? Well then, I can tell you I know you, for
all your face is covered, and I can tell you I am up to you, however you
may hide your tricks. After all, where envy reigns virtue cannot live, and
where there is niggardliness there can be no liberality. Ill betide the
devil! if it had not been for your worship my master would be married to
the Princess Micomicona this minute, and I should be a count at least; for
no less was to be expected, as well from the goodness of my master, him of
the Rueful Countenance, as from the greatness of my services. But I see
now how true it is what they say in these parts, that the wheel of fortune
turns faster than a mill-wheel, and that those who were up yesterday are
down to-day. I am sorry for my wife and children, for when they might
fairly and reasonably expect to see their father return to them a governor
or viceroy of some island or kingdom, they will see him come back a
horse-boy. I have said all this, señor curate, only to urge your paternity
to lay to your conscience your ill-treatment of my master; and have a care
that God does not call you to account in another life for making a
prisoner of him in this way, and charge against you all the succours and
good deeds that my lord Don Quixote leaves undone while he is shut up.
</p>
<p>
“Trim those lamps there!” exclaimed the barber at this; “so you are of the
same fraternity as your master, too, Sancho? By God, I begin to see that
you will have to keep him company in the cage, and be enchanted like him
for having caught some of his humour and chivalry. It was an evil hour
when you let yourself be got with child by his promises, and that island
you long so much for found its way into your head.”
</p>
<p>
“I am not with child by anyone,” returned Sancho, “nor am I a man to let
myself be got with child, if it was by the King himself. Though I am poor
I am an old Christian, and I owe nothing to nobody, and if I long for an
island, other people long for worse. Each of us is the son of his own
works; and being a man I may come to be pope, not to say governor of an
island, especially as my master may win so many that he will not know whom
to give them to. Mind how you talk, master barber; for shaving is not
everything, and there is some difference between Peter and Peter. I say
this because we all know one another, and it will not do to throw false
dice with me; and as to the enchantment of my master, God knows the truth;
leave it as it is; it only makes it worse to stir it.”
</p>
<p>
The barber did not care to answer Sancho lest by his plain speaking he
should disclose what the curate and he himself were trying so hard to
conceal; and under the same apprehension the curate had asked the canon to
ride on a little in advance, so that he might tell him the mystery of this
man in the cage, and other things that would amuse him. The canon agreed,
and going on ahead with his servants, listened with attention to the
account of the character, life, madness, and ways of Don Quixote, given
him by the curate, who described to him briefly the beginning and origin
of his craze, and told him the whole story of his adventures up to his
being confined in the cage, together with the plan they had of taking him
home to try if by any means they could discover a cure for his madness.
The canon and his servants were surprised anew when they heard Don
Quixote’s strange story, and when it was finished he said, “To tell the
truth, señor curate, I for my part consider what they call books of
chivalry to be mischievous to the State; and though, led by idle and false
taste, I have read the beginnings of almost all that have been printed, I
never could manage to read any one of them from beginning to end; for it
seems to me they are all more or less the same thing; and one has nothing
more in it than another; this no more than that. And in my opinion this
sort of writing and composition is of the same species as the fables they
call the Milesian, nonsensical tales that aim solely at giving amusement
and not instruction, exactly the opposite of the apologue fables which
amuse and instruct at the same time. And though it may be the chief object
of such books to amuse, I do not know how they can succeed, when they are
so full of such monstrous nonsense. For the enjoyment the mind feels must
come from the beauty and harmony which it perceives or contemplates in the
things that the eye or the imagination brings before it; and nothing that
has any ugliness or disproportion about it can give any pleasure. What
beauty, then, or what proportion of the parts to the whole, or of the
whole to the parts, can there be in a book or fable where a lad of sixteen
cuts down a giant as tall as a tower and makes two halves of him as if he
was an almond cake? And when they want to give us a picture of a battle,
after having told us that there are a million of combatants on the side of
the enemy, let the hero of the book be opposed to them, and we have
perforce to believe, whether we like it or not, that the said knight wins
the victory by the single might of his strong arm. And then, what shall we
say of the facility with which a born queen or empress will give herself
over into the arms of some unknown wandering knight? What mind, that is
not wholly barbarous and uncultured, can find pleasure in reading of how a
great tower full of knights sails away across the sea like a ship with a
fair wind, and will be to-night in Lombardy and to-morrow morning in the
land of Prester John of the Indies, or some other that Ptolemy never
described nor Marco Polo saw? And if, in answer to this, I am told that
the authors of books of the kind write them as fiction, and therefore are
not bound to regard niceties of truth, I would reply that fiction is all
the better the more it looks like truth, and gives the more pleasure the
more probability and possibility there is about it. Plots in fiction
should be wedded to the understanding of the reader, and be constructed in
such a way that, reconciling impossibilities, smoothing over difficulties,
keeping the mind on the alert, they may surprise, interest, divert, and
entertain, so that wonder and delight joined may keep pace one with the
other; all which he will fail to effect who shuns verisimilitude and truth
to nature, wherein lies the perfection of writing. I have never yet seen
any book of chivalry that puts together a connected plot complete in all
its numbers, so that the middle agrees with the beginning, and the end
with the beginning and middle; on the contrary, they construct them with
such a multitude of members that it seems as though they meant to produce
a chimera or monster rather than a well-proportioned figure. And besides
all this they are harsh in their style, incredible in their achievements,
licentious in their amours, uncouth in their courtly speeches, prolix in
their battles, silly in their arguments, absurd in their travels, and, in
short, wanting in everything like intelligent art; for which reason they
deserve to be banished from the Christian commonwealth as a worthless
breed.”

The curate listened to him attentively and felt that he was a man of sound
understanding, and that there was good reason in what he said; so he told
him that, being of the same opinion himself, and bearing a grudge to books
of chivalry, he had burned all Don Quixote’s, which were many; and gave
him an account of the scrutiny he had made of them, and of those he had
condemned to the flames and those he had spared, with which the canon was
not a little amused, adding that though he had said so much in
condemnation of these books, still he found one good thing in them, and
that was the opportunity they afforded to a gifted intellect for
displaying itself; for they presented a wide and spacious field over which
the pen might range freely, describing shipwrecks, tempests, combats,
battles, portraying a valiant captain with all the qualifications
requisite to make one, showing him sagacious in foreseeing the wiles of
the enemy, eloquent in speech to encourage or restrain his soldiers, ripe
in counsel, rapid in resolve, as bold in biding his time as in pressing
the attack; now picturing some sad tragic incident, now some joyful and
unexpected event; here a beauteous lady, virtuous, wise, and modest; there
a Christian knight, brave and gentle; here a lawless, barbarous braggart;
there a courteous prince, gallant and gracious; setting forth the devotion
and loyalty of vassals, the greatness and generosity of nobles. “Or
again,” said he, “the author may show himself to be an astronomer, or a
skilled cosmographer, or musician, or one versed in affairs of state, and
sometimes he will have a chance of coming forward as a magician if he
likes. He can set forth the craftiness of Ulysses, the piety of Æneas,
the valour of Achilles, the misfortunes of Hector, the treachery of Sinon,
the friendship of Euryalus, the generosity of Alexander, the boldness of
Cæsar, the clemency and truth of Trajan, the fidelity of Zopyrus, the
wisdom of Cato, and in short all the faculties that serve to make an
illustrious man perfect, now uniting them in one individual, again
distributing them among many; and if this be done with charm of style and
ingenious invention, aiming at the truth as much as possible, he will
assuredly weave a web of bright and varied threads that, when finished,
will display such perfection and beauty that it will attain the worthiest
object any writing can seek, which, as I said before, is to give
instruction and pleasure combined; for the unrestricted range of these
books enables the author to show his powers, epic, lyric, tragic, or
comic, and all the moods the sweet and winning arts of poesy and oratory
are capable of; for the epic may be written in prose just as well as in
verse.”

“It is as you say, señor canon,” said the curate; “and for that reason
those who have hitherto written books of the sort deserve all the more
censure for writing without paying any attention to good taste or the
rules of art, by which they might guide themselves and become as famous in
prose as the two princes of Greek and Latin poetry are in verse.”
</p>
<p>
“I myself, at any rate,” said the canon, “was once tempted to write a book
of chivalry in which all the points I have mentioned were to be observed;
and if I must own the truth I have more than a hundred sheets written; and
to try if it came up to my own opinion of it, I showed them to persons who
were fond of this kind of reading, to learned and intelligent men as well
as to ignorant people who cared for nothing but the pleasure of listening
to nonsense, and from all I obtained flattering approval; nevertheless I
proceeded no farther with it, as well because it seemed to me an
occupation inconsistent with my profession, as because I perceived that
the fools are more numerous than the wise; and, though it is better to be
praised by the wise few than applauded by the foolish many, I have no mind
to submit myself to the stupid judgment of the silly public, to whom the
reading of such books falls for the most part.
</p>
<p>
“But what most of all made me hold my hand and even abandon all idea of
finishing it was an argument I put to myself taken from the plays that are
acted now-a-days, which was in this wise: if those that are now in vogue,
as well those that are pure invention as those founded on history, are,
all or most of them, downright nonsense and things that have neither head
nor tail, and yet the public listens to them with delight, and regards and
cries them up as perfection when they are so far from it; and if the
authors who write them, and the players who act them, say that this is
what they must be, for the public wants this and will have nothing else;
and that those that go by rule and work out a plot according to the laws
of art will only find some half-dozen intelligent people to understand
them, while all the rest remain blind to the merit of their composition;
and that for themselves it is better to get bread from the many than
praise from the few; then my book will fare the same way, after I have
burnt off my eyebrows in trying to observe the principles I have spoken
of, and I shall be ‘the tailor of the corner.’ And though I have sometimes
endeavoured to convince actors that they are mistaken in this notion they
have adopted, and that they would attract more people, and get more
credit, by producing plays in accordance with the rules of art, than by
absurd ones, they are so thoroughly wedded to their own opinion that no
argument or evidence can wean them from it.
</p>
<p>
“I remember saying one day to one of these obstinate fellows, ‘Tell me, do
you not recollect that a few years ago, there were three tragedies acted
in Spain, written by a famous poet of these kingdoms, which were such that
they filled all who heard them with admiration, delight, and interest, the
ignorant as well as the wise, the masses as well as the higher orders, and
brought in more money to the performers, these three alone, than thirty of
the best that have been since produced?’
</p>
<p>
“‘No doubt,’ replied the actor in question, ‘you mean the “Isabella,” the
“Phyllis,” and the “Alexandra.”’
</p>
<p>
“‘Those are the ones I mean,’ said I; ‘and see if they did not observe the
principles of art, and if, by observing them, they failed to show their
superiority and please all the world; so that the fault does not lie with
the public that insists upon nonsense, but with those who don’t know how
to produce something else. “The Ingratitude Revenged” was not nonsense,
nor was there any in “The Numantia,” nor any to be found in “The Merchant
Lover,” nor yet in “The Friendly Fair Foe,” nor in some others that have
been written by certain gifted poets, to their own fame and renown, and to
the profit of those that brought them out;’ some further remarks I added
to these, with which, I think, I left him rather dumbfoundered, but not so
satisfied or convinced that I could disabuse him of his error.”
</p>
<p>
“You have touched upon a subject, señor canon,” observed the curate here,
“that has awakened an old enmity I have against the plays in vogue at the
present day, quite as strong as that which I bear to the books of
chivalry; for while the drama, according to Tully, should be the mirror of
human life, the model of manners, and the image of the truth, those which
are presented now-a-days are mirrors of nonsense, models of folly, and
images of lewdness. For what greater nonsense can there be in connection
with what we are now discussing than for an infant to appear in swaddling
clothes in the first scene of the first act, and in the second a grown-up
bearded man? Or what greater absurdity can there be than putting before us
an old man as a swashbuckler, a young man as a poltroon, a lackey using
fine language, a page giving sage advice, a king plying as a porter, a
princess who is a kitchen-maid? And then what shall I say of their
attention to the time in which the action they represent may or can take
place, save that I have seen a play where the first act began in Europe,
the second in Asia, the third finished in Africa, and no doubt, had it
been in four acts, the fourth would have ended in America, and so it would
have been laid in all four quarters of the globe? And if truth to life is
the main thing the drama should keep in view, how is it possible for any
average understanding to be satisfied when the action is supposed to pass
in the time of King Pepin or Charlemagne, and the principal personage in
it they represent to be the Emperor Heraclius who entered Jerusalem with
the cross and won the Holy Sepulchre, like Godfrey of Bouillon, there
being years innumerable between the one and the other? or, if the play is
based on fiction and historical facts are introduced, or bits of what
occurred to different people and at different times mixed up with it, all,
not only without any semblance of probability, but with obvious errors
that from every point of view are inexcusable? And the worst of it is,
there are ignorant people who say that this is perfection, and that
anything beyond this is affected refinement. And then if we turn to sacred
dramas—what miracles they invent in them! What apocryphal, ill-devised
incidents, attributing to one saint the miracles of another! And even in
secular plays they venture to introduce miracles without any reason or
object except that they think some such miracle, or transformation as they
call it, will come in well to astonish stupid people and draw them to the
play. All this tends to the prejudice of the truth and the corruption of
history, nay more, to the reproach of the wits of Spain; for foreigners
who scrupulously observe the laws of the drama look upon us as barbarous
and ignorant, when they see the absurdity and nonsense of the plays we
produce. Nor will it be a sufficient excuse to say that the chief object
well-ordered governments have in view when they permit plays to be
performed in public is to entertain the people with some harmless
amusement occasionally, and keep it from those evil humours which idleness
is apt to engender; and that, as this may be attained by any sort of play,
good or bad, there is no need to lay down laws, or bind those who write or
act them to make them as they ought to be made, since, as I say, the
object sought for may be secured by any sort. To this I would reply that
the same end would be, beyond all comparison, better attained by means of
good plays than by those that are not so; for after listening to an
artistic and properly constructed play, the hearer will come away
enlivened by the jests, instructed by the serious parts, full of
admiration at the incidents, his wits sharpened by the arguments, warned
by the tricks, all the wiser for the examples, inflamed against vice, and
in love with virtue; for in all these ways a good play will stimulate the
mind of the hearer be he ever so boorish or dull; and of all
impossibilities the greatest is that a play endowed with all these
qualities will not entertain, satisfy, and please much more than one
wanting in them, like the greater number of those which are commonly acted
now-a-days. Nor are the poets who write them to be blamed for this; for
some there are among them who are perfectly well aware of their faults,
and know what they ought to do; but as plays have become a salable
commodity, they say, and with truth, that the actors will not buy them
unless they are after this fashion; and so the poet tries to adapt himself
to the requirements of the actor who is to pay him for his work. And that
this is the truth may be seen by the countless plays that a most fertile
wit of these kingdoms has written, with so much brilliancy, so much grace
and gaiety, such polished versification, such choice language, such
profound reflections, and in a word, so rich in eloquence and elevation of
style, that he has filled the world with his fame; and yet, in consequence
of his desire to suit the taste of the actors, they have not all, as some
of them have, come as near perfection as they ought. Others write plays
with such heedlessness that, after they have been acted, the actors have
to fly and abscond, afraid of being punished, as they often have been, for
having acted something offensive to some king or other, or insulting to
some noble family. All which evils, and many more that I say nothing of,
would be removed if there were some intelligent and sensible person at the
capital to examine all plays before they were acted, not only those
produced in the capital itself, but all that were intended to be acted in
Spain; without whose approval, seal, and signature, no local magistracy
should allow any play to be acted. In that case actors would take care to
send their plays to the capital, and could act them in safety, and those
who write them would be more careful and take more pains with their work,
standing in awe of having to submit it to the strict examination of one
who understood the matter; and so good plays would be produced and the
objects they aim at happily attained; as well the amusement of the people,
as the credit of the wits of Spain, the interest and safety of the actors,
and the saving of trouble in inflicting punishment on them. And if the
same or some other person were authorised to examine the newly written
books of chivalry, no doubt some would appear with all the perfections you
have described, enriching our language with the gracious and precious
treasure of eloquence, and driving the old books into obscurity before the
light of the new ones that would come out for the harmless entertainment,
not merely of the idle but of the very busiest; for the bow cannot be
always bent, nor can weak human nature exist without some lawful
amusement.”
</p>
<p>
The canon and the curate had proceeded thus far with their conversation,
when the barber, coming forward, joined them, and said to the curate,
“This is the spot, señor licentiate, that I said was a good one for fresh
and plentiful pasture for the oxen, while we take our noontide rest.”
</p>
<p>
“And so it seems,” returned the curate, and he told the canon what he
proposed to do, on which he too made up his mind to halt with them,
attracted by the aspect of the fair valley that lay before their eyes; and
to enjoy it as well as the conversation of the curate, to whom he had
begun to take a fancy, and also to learn more particulars about the doings
of Don Quixote, he desired some of his servants to go on to the inn, which
was not far distant, and fetch from it what eatables there might be for
the whole party, as he meant to rest for the afternoon where he was; to
which one of his servants replied that the sumpter mule, which by this
time ought to have reached the inn, carried provisions enough to make it
unnecessary to get anything from the inn except barley.
</p>
<p>
“In that case,” said the canon, “take all the beasts there, and bring the
sumpter mule back.”
</p>
<p>
While this was going on, Sancho, perceiving that he could speak to his
master without having the curate and the barber, of whom he had his
suspicions, present all the time, approached the cage in which Don Quixote
was placed, and said, “Señor, to ease my conscience I want to tell you the
state of the case as to your enchantment, and that is that these two here,
with their faces covered, are the curate of our village and the barber;
and I suspect they have hit upon this plan of carrying you off in this
fashion, out of pure envy because your worship surpasses them in doing
famous deeds; and if this be the truth it follows that you are not
enchanted, but hoodwinked and made a fool of. And to prove this I want to
ask you one thing; and if you answer me as I believe you will answer, you
will be able to lay your finger on the trick, and you will see that you
are not enchanted but gone wrong in your wits.”
</p>
<p>
“Ask what thou wilt, Sancho my son,” returned Don Quixote, “for I will
satisfy thee and answer all thou requirest. As to what thou sayest, that
these who accompany us yonder are the curate and the barber, our
neighbours and acquaintances, it is very possible that they may seem to be
those same persons; but that they are so in reality and in fact, believe
it not on any account; what thou art to believe and think is that, if they
look like them, as thou sayest, it must be that those who have enchanted
me have taken this shape and likeness; for it is easy for enchanters to
take any form they please, and they may have taken those of our friends in
order to make thee think as thou dost, and lead thee into a labyrinth of
fancies from which thou wilt find no escape though thou hadst the cord of
Theseus; and they may also have done it to make me uncertain in my mind,
and unable to conjecture whence this evil comes to me; for if on the one
hand thou dost tell me that the barber and curate of our village are here
in company with us, and on the other I find myself shut up in a cage, and
know in my heart that no power on earth that was not supernatural would
have been able to shut me in, what wouldst thou have me say or think, but
that my enchantment is of a sort that transcends all I have ever read of
in all the histories that deal with knights-errant that have been
enchanted? So thou mayest set thy mind at rest as to the idea that they
are what thou sayest, for they are as much so as I am a Turk. But touching
thy desire to ask me something, say on, and I will answer thee, though
thou shouldst ask questions from this till to-morrow morning.”
</p>
<p>
“May Our Lady be good to me!” said Sancho, lifting up his voice;
“and is it possible that your worship is so thick of skull and so short
of brains that you cannot see that what I say is the simple truth, and that
malice has more to do with your imprisonment and misfortune than enchantment?
But as it is so, I will prove plainly to you that you are not enchanted. Now
tell me, so may God deliver you from this affliction, and so may you find
yourself when you least expect it in the arms of my lady Dulcinea—”
</p>
<p>
“Leave off conjuring me,” said Don Quixote, “and ask what thou wouldst
know; I have already told thee I will answer with all possible precision.”
</p>
<p>
“That is what I want,” said Sancho; “and what I would know,
and have you tell me, without adding or leaving out anything, but telling the
whole truth as one expects it to be told, and as it is told, by all who profess
arms, as your worship professes them, under the title of
knights-errant—”
</p>
<p>
“I tell thee I will not lie in any particular,” said Don Quixote; “finish
thy question; for in truth thou weariest me with all these asseverations,
requirements, and precautions, Sancho.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, I rely on the goodness and truth of my master,” said Sancho; “and
so, because it bears upon what we are talking about, I would ask, speaking
with all reverence, whether since your worship has been shut up and, as
you think, enchanted in this cage, you have felt any desire or inclination
to go anywhere, as the saying is?”
</p>
<p>
“I do not understand ‘going anywhere,’” said Don Quixote; “explain thyself
more clearly, Sancho, if thou wouldst have me give an answer to the
point.”
</p>
<p>
“Is it possible,” said Sancho, “that your worship does not understand
‘going anywhere’? Why, the schoolboys know that from the time they were
babes. Well then, you must know I mean have you had any desire to do what
cannot be avoided?”
</p>
<p>
“Ah! now I understand thee, Sancho,” said Don Quixote; “yes, often, and
even this minute; get me out of this strait, or all will not go right.”

“Aha, I have caught you,” said Sancho; “this is what in my heart and soul
I was longing to know. Come now, señor, can you deny what is commonly said
around us, when a person is out of humour, ‘I don’t know what ails
so-and-so, that he neither eats, nor drinks, nor sleeps, nor gives a
proper answer to any question; one would think he was enchanted’? From
which it is to be gathered that those who do not eat, or drink, or sleep,
or do any of the natural acts I am speaking of—that such persons are
enchanted; but not those that have the desire your worship has, and drink
when drink is given them, and eat when there is anything to eat, and
answer every question that is asked them.”
</p>
<p>
“What thou sayest is true, Sancho,” replied Don Quixote; “but I have
already told thee there are many sorts of enchantments, and it may be that
in the course of time they have been changed one for another, and that now
it may be the way with enchanted people to do all that I do, though they
did not do so before; so it is vain to argue or draw inferences against
the usage of the time. I know and feel that I am enchanted, and that is
enough to ease my conscience; for it would weigh heavily on it if I
thought that I was not enchanted, and that in a faint-hearted and cowardly
way I allowed myself to lie in this cage, defrauding multitudes of the
succour I might afford to those in need and distress, who at this very
moment may be in sore want of my aid and protection.”

“Still for all that,” replied Sancho, “I say that, for your greater and
fuller satisfaction, it would be well if your worship were to try to get
out of this prison (and I promise to do all in my power to help, and even
to take you out of it), and see if you could once more mount your good
Rocinante, who seems to be enchanted too, he is so melancholy and
dejected; and then we might try our chance in looking for adventures
again; and if we have no luck there will be time enough to go back to the
cage; in which, on the faith of a good and loyal squire, I promise to shut
myself up along with your worship, if so be you are so unfortunate, or I
so stupid, as not to be able to carry out my plan.”
</p>
<p>
“I am content to do as thou sayest, brother Sancho,” said Don Quixote,
“and when thou seest an opportunity for effecting my release I will obey
thee absolutely; but thou wilt see, Sancho, how mistaken thou art in thy
conception of my misfortune.”
</p>
<p>
The knight-errant and the ill-errant squire kept up their conversation
till they reached the place where the curate, the canon, and the barber,
who had already dismounted, were waiting for them. The carter at once
unyoked the oxen and left them to roam at large about the pleasant green
spot, the freshness of which seemed to invite, not enchanted people like
Don Quixote, but wide-awake, sensible folk like his squire, who begged the
curate to allow his master to leave the cage for a little; for if they did
not let him out, the prison might not be as clean as the propriety of such
a gentleman as his master required. The curate understood him, and said he
would very gladly comply with his request, only that he feared his master,
finding himself at liberty, would take to his old courses and make off
where nobody could ever find him again.
</p>
<p>
“I will answer for his not running away,” said Sancho.
</p>
<p>
“And I also,” said the canon, “especially if he gives me his word as a
knight not to leave us without our consent.”
</p>
<p>
Don Quixote, who was listening to all this, said, “I give
it;—moreover one who is enchanted as I am cannot do as he likes with
himself; for he who had enchanted him could prevent his moving from one place
for three ages, and if he attempted to escape would bring him back
flying.”—And that being so, they might as well release him,
particularly as it would be to the advantage of all; for, if they did not let
him out, he protested he would be unable to avoid offending their nostrils
unless they kept their distance.
</p>
<p>
The canon took his hand, tied together as they both were, and on his word
and promise they unbound him, and rejoiced beyond measure he was to find
himself out of the cage. The first thing he did was to stretch himself all
over, and then he went to where Rocinante was standing and giving him a
couple of slaps on the haunches said, “I still trust in God and in his
blessed mother, O flower and mirror of steeds, that we shall soon see
ourselves, both of us, as we wish to be, thou with thy master on thy back,
and I mounted upon thee, following the calling for which God sent me into
the world.” And so saying, accompanied by Sancho, he withdrew to a retired
spot, from which he came back much relieved and more eager than ever to
put his squire’s scheme into execution.
</p>
<p>
The canon gazed at him, wondering at the extraordinary nature of his
madness, and that in all his remarks and replies he should show such
excellent sense, and only lose his stirrups, as has been already said,
when the subject of chivalry was broached. And so, moved by compassion, he
said to him, as they all sat on the green grass awaiting the arrival of
the provisions:
</p>
<p>
“Is it possible, gentle sir, that the nauseous and idle reading of books
of chivalry can have had such an effect on your worship as to upset your
reason so that you fancy yourself enchanted, and the like, all as far from
the truth as falsehood itself is? How can there be any human understanding
that can persuade itself there ever was all that infinity of Amadises in
the world, or all that multitude of famous knights, all those emperors of
Trebizond, all those Felixmartes of Hircania, all those palfreys, and
damsels-errant, and serpents, and monsters, and giants, and marvellous
adventures, and enchantments of every kind, and battles, and prodigious
encounters, splendid costumes, love-sick princesses, squires made counts,
droll dwarfs, love letters, billings and cooings, swashbuckler women, and,
in a word, all that nonsense the books of chivalry contain? For myself, I
can only say that when I read them, so long as I do not stop to think that
they are all lies and frivolity, they give me a certain amount of
pleasure; but when I come to consider what they are, I fling the very best
of them at the wall, and would fling it into the fire if there were one at
hand, as richly deserving such punishment as cheats and impostors out of
the range of ordinary toleration, and as founders of new sects and modes
of life, and teachers that lead the ignorant public to believe and accept
as truth all the folly they contain. And such is their audacity, they even
dare to unsettle the wits of gentlemen of birth and intelligence, as is
shown plainly by the way they have served your worship, when they have
brought you to such a pass that you have to be shut up in a cage and
carried on an ox-cart as one would carry a lion or a tiger from place to
place to make money by showing it. Come, Señor Don Quixote, have some
compassion for yourself, return to the bosom of common sense, and make use
of the liberal share of it that heaven has been pleased to bestow upon
you, employing your abundant gifts of mind in some other reading that may
serve to benefit your conscience and add to your honour. And if, still led
away by your natural bent, you desire to read books of achievements and of
chivalry, read the Book of Judges in the Holy Scriptures, for there you
will find grand reality, and deeds as true as they are heroic. Lusitania
had a Viriatus, Rome a Cæsar, Carthage a Hannibal, Greece an Alexander,
Castile a Count Fernan Gonzalez, Valencia a Cid, Andalusia a Gonzalo
Fernandez, Estremadura a Diego García de Paredes, Jerez a Garci Perez de
Vargas, Toledo a Garcilaso, Seville a Don Manuel de Leon, to read of whose
valiant deeds will entertain and instruct the loftiest minds and fill them
with delight and wonder. Here, Señor Don Quixote, will be reading worthy
of your sound understanding; from which you will rise learned in history,
in love with virtue, strengthened in goodness, improved in manners, brave
without rashness, prudent without cowardice; and all to the honour of God,
your own advantage and the glory of La Mancha, whence, I am informed, your
worship derives your birth.”
</p>
<p>
Don Quixote listened with the greatest attention to the canon’s words, and
when he found he had finished, after regarding him for some time, he
replied to him:
</p>
<p>
“It appears to me, gentle sir, that your worship’s discourse is intended
to persuade me that there never were any knights-errant in the world, and
that all the books of chivalry are false, lying, mischievous and useless
to the State, and that I have done wrong in reading them, and worse in
believing them, and still worse in imitating them, when I undertook to
follow the arduous calling of knight-errantry which they set forth; for
you deny that there ever were Amadises of Gaul or of Greece, or any other
of the knights of whom the books are full.”
</p>
<p>
“It is all exactly as you state it,” said the canon; to which Don Quixote
returned, “You also went on to say that books of this kind had done me
much harm, inasmuch as they had upset my senses, and shut me up in a cage,
and that it would be better for me to reform and change my studies, and
read other truer books which would afford more pleasure and instruction.”
</p>
<p>
“Just so,” said the canon.
</p>
<p>
“Well then,” returned Don Quixote, “to my mind it is you who are the one
that is out of his wits and enchanted, as you have ventured to utter such
blasphemies against a thing so universally acknowledged and accepted as
true that whoever denies it, as you do, deserves the same punishment which
you say you inflict on the books that irritate you when you read them. For
to try to persuade anybody that Amadis, and all the other
knights-adventurers with whom the books are filled, never existed, would
be like trying to persuade him that the sun does not yield light, or ice
cold, or earth nourishment. What wit in the world can persuade another
that the story of the Princess Floripes and Guy of Burgundy is not true,
or that of Fierabras and the bridge of Mantible, which happened in the
time of Charlemagne? For by all that is good it is as true as that it is
daylight now; and if it be a lie, it must be a lie too that there was a
Hector, or Achilles, or Trojan war, or Twelve Peers of France, or Arthur
of England, who still lives changed into a raven, and is unceasingly
looked for in his kingdom. One might just as well try to make out that the
history of Guarino Mezquino, or of the quest of the Holy Grail, is false,
or that the loves of Tristram and the Queen Yseult are apocryphal, as well
as those of Guinevere and Lancelot, when there are persons who can almost
remember having seen the Dame Quintañona, who was the best cupbearer in
Great Britain. And so true is this, that I recollect a grandmother of mine
on the father’s side, whenever she saw any dame in a venerable hood, used
to say to me, ‘Grandson, that one is like Dame Quintañona,’ from which I
conclude that she must have known her, or at least had managed to see some
portrait of her. Then who can deny that the story of Pierres and the fair
Magalona is true, when even to this day may be seen in the king’s armoury
the pin with which the valiant Pierres guided the wooden horse he rode
through the air, and it is a trifle bigger than the pole of a cart? And
alongside of the pin is Babieca’s saddle, and at Roncesvalles there is
Roland’s horn, as large as a large beam; whence we may infer that there
were Twelve Peers, and a Pierres, and a Cid, and other knights like them,
of the sort people commonly call adventurers. Or perhaps I shall be told,
too, that there was no such knight-errant as the valiant Lusitanian Juan
de Merlo, who went to Burgundy and in the city of Arras fought with the
famous lord of Charny, Mosen Pierres by name, and afterwards in the city
of Basle with Mosen Enrique de Remesten, coming out of both encounters
covered with fame and honour; or adventures and challenges achieved and
delivered, also in Burgundy, by the valiant Spaniards Pedro Barba and
Gutierre Quixada (of whose family I come in the direct male line), when
they vanquished the sons of the Count of San Polo. I shall be told, too,
that Don Fernando de Guevara did not go in quest of adventures to Germany,
where he engaged in combat with Micer George, a knight of the house of the
Duke of Austria. I shall be told that the jousts of Suero de Quiñones, him
of the ‘Paso,’ and the emprise of Mosen Luis de Falces against the
Castilian knight, Don Gonzalo de Guzman, were mere mockeries; as well as
many other achievements of Christian knights of these and foreign realms,
which are so authentic and true, that, I repeat, he who denies them must
be totally wanting in reason and good sense.”
</p>
<p>
The canon was amazed to hear the medley of truth and fiction Don Quixote
uttered, and to see how well acquainted he was with everything relating or
belonging to the achievements of his knight-errantry; so he said in reply:
</p>
<p>
“I cannot deny, Señor Don Quixote, that there is some truth in what you
say, especially as regards the Spanish knights-errant; and I am willing to
grant too that the Twelve Peers of France existed, but I am not disposed
to believe that they did all the things that the Archbishop Turpin relates
of them. For the truth of the matter is they were knights chosen by the
kings of France, and called ‘Peers’ because they were all equal in worth,
rank and prowess (at least if they were not they ought to have been), and
it was a kind of religious order like those of Santiago and Calatrava in
the present day, in which it is assumed that those who take it are valiant
knights of distinction and good birth; and just as we say now a Knight of
St. John, or of Alcántara, they used to say then a Knight of the Twelve
Peers, because twelve equals were chosen for that military order. That
there was a Cid, as well as a Bernardo del Carpio, there can be no doubt;
but that they did the deeds people say they did, I hold to be very
doubtful. In that other matter of the pin of Count Pierres that you speak
of, and say is near Babieca’s saddle in the Armoury, I confess my sin; for
I am either so stupid or so short-sighted, that, though I have seen the
saddle, I have never been able to see the pin, in spite of it being as big
as your worship says it is.”
</p>
<p>
“For all that it is there, without any manner of doubt,” said Don Quixote;
“and more by token they say it is inclosed in a sheath of cowhide to keep
it from rusting.”
</p>
<p>
“All that may be,” replied the canon; “but, by the orders I have received,
I do not remember seeing it. However, granting it is there, that is no
reason why I am bound to believe the stories of all those Amadises and of
all that multitude of knights they tell us about, nor is it reasonable
that a man like your worship, so worthy, and with so many good qualities,
and endowed with such a good understanding, should allow himself to be
persuaded that such wild crazy things as are written in those absurd books
of chivalry are really true.”

“A good joke, that!” returned Don Quixote. “Books that have been printed
with the king’s licence, and with the approbation of those to whom they
have been submitted, and read with universal delight, and extolled by
great and small, rich and poor, learned and ignorant, gentle and simple,
in a word by people of every sort, of whatever rank or condition they may
be—that these should be lies! And above all when they carry such an
appearance of truth with them; for they tell us the father, mother,
country, kindred, age, place, and the achievements, step by step, and day
by day, performed by such a knight or knights! Hush, sir; utter not such
blasphemy; trust me I am advising you now to act as a sensible man should;
only read them, and you will see the pleasure you will derive from them.
For, come, tell me, can there be anything more delightful than to see, as
it were, here now displayed before us a vast lake of bubbling pitch with a
host of snakes and serpents and lizards, and ferocious and terrible
creatures of all sorts swimming about in it, while from the middle of the
