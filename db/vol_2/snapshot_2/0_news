Is the following conjecture reasonable and/or provable? :

Given a sequence of digits, starting with a non-zero digit, of arbitrary
but finite length, is it always possible to extend this sequence by
appending more digits, in such a way as to form a prime?

e.g. the sequence 1 can be extended into a prime in an infinite number
of ways, as in 13, 17, 19, 101, 1231, 1579, etc (there an infinite
number of primes beginning with a 1 by Bertrand's postulate).
However, it is far more difficult to try and locate a prime which
starts with the sequence 1528296922945708 (although at least one is known).

My personal opinion is that the conjecture is reasonable, simply because
one can keep adding digits at the end and checking for primality ad
infinitum, and the law of averages will do the rest. Of course this is
totally groundless mathematically, so can anyone provide a heuristic
argument with more weight?

Sure it can do anything. The best way for a programmable text editor to
simulate a structure editor would be for it to build an internal 
representation (or structure) or what was really being edited and then 
use its text manipulating primitives to show the user the effect of his 
editing commands on the structure that is "really" being edited. Now you've
shown that mocklisp (for example) is a language in which you can implement
a structure editor. I doubt if it is the best way to do it though.

I don't know about "commands", but Common Lisp comments are nothing
like Common Lisp code (much to the shame of Common Lisp). I want the
characters I type in as comments treated differently than those I type in 
as parts of S-expressions.

You're right. An editor which is really editing the structure underlying

But it is one of the reasons Xerox structure editor fans are fans.

No offense intended, but I could tell. If you write any Lisp you should
look for an opportunity to try SEdit on a D-machine.

  No way. Brand is "a figure both like Bleys and myself. My features, though
smaller, my eyes, Bleys' hair. There was a quality of both strength and weak-
ness, questing and abandonment about him." This is Corwin speaking, of course.

  And Bleys is "a fiery bearded, flame-crowned man, dressed all in red and
orange, mainly of silk stuff, and he held a sword in his right hand and a
glass of wine in his left, and the devil himself danced behind his eyes, as
blue as Flora's, or Eric's. His chin was slight, but the beard covered it."

  I can't think of anyone offhand for either part, but I nominate Gene Simmons
to play Caine: "Then came the swarthy, dark-eyed countenance of Caine, dressed
all in satin that was black and green, wearing a dark three-cornered hat set
at a rakish angle, a green plume of feathers trailing down the back." (Yeah,
I got "Nine Princes in Amber" lying right next to the keyboard here)

  Random: "a wily-looking little man, with a sharp nose and a laughing mouth
and a shock of straw-colored hair." How about Dudley Moore (with his hair
bleached, of course).

  Dierdre: "a black-haired girl with [Flora's] blue eyes, and her hair hung
long and she was dressed all in black, with a girdle of silver about her
waist." Lee Meriwether or Kate Jackson.

  Fiona: "with hair like Bleys or Brand, [Corwin's] eyes, and a complexion
like mother of pearl.  Ann-Margret!

  That's all for now; if people are interested I can type in the whole 2-1/2
pages of descriptions so we'll REALLY have something to argue over.

The answer is perhaps. In an ideal world, everyone will adhere to one
standard for mail headers - RFC822 possibly, but X.400 is more likely.
Until that glorious day arrives (if it ever does), mailers at the mail
'gateways' between networks will have little option but to munge
addresses because of incompatible mail headers and addressing formats.

What you mail system should do is rewrite mail headers into the
appropriate form for transmission to a given host. In short, if your
uucp neighbours only understand bang-style addresses, you mailer should
only present bang-style paths to these sites. If some sites understand
RFC822 (user@host.domain), then you should send them RFC822 style mail.
What would be less easy for the mailer is separating your bang-stlye
uucp neighbours from those who understand RFC822.

The best mailers (MMDF or sendmail - no flames please!) take an input
address, convert it to a canonical form and then rewrite the address in
the appropriate style for the message transfer agent. This is the most
sensible way of dealing with hybrid addresses like A!B@C. [Does that
mean send by uucp to A for relaying to user B on host C or does it mean
send to C for them to relay to user B on uucp host A? Then what if C
(or A) doesn't like addresses with '!' (or '@') signs in them?]

  Yea, verily, I recall The Questor Tapes. I've forgotten the scientist's
name, but he was a very rich and secretive genius known for several major
advances in robotics and cybernetics. About 2 years previous to the start
of the movie, he had disappeared, leaving only a partially completed project
he called Questor. Much of the work was complete, including a small fusion
reactor, most of the brain, and a lot of the support machinery. He also left
a BIG mag tape of programs, which some government idiot had partially erased
while trying to decode it. Questor, when activated, did nothing; the team
that assembled him figured it was because of the bad tape.

  Late that night, Questor got up, used the 'finishing' molds to give himself
human features, and walked out. The scientist had known one member of the
Questor-assembly team and put his name and address on the program tape; by
good fortune it had survived the attempted decoding. Questor knows only that
he must find `a boat' -- other details have been erased.

  The government catches up with them in a playground and some fool shoots
Questor. Apparently the shock knocks some bits loose because when he sees
a jungle gym that looks like Noah's Ark he remembers, "the boat, the boat
of legend. [whatsisname] is waiting for me there." He also remembers that
if he doesn't find the scientist within about two days, his fusion power
supply is programmed to overload and blow up.

  They patch him up and he leads them a merry chase to Mt. Ararat where he
finds his creator in a cave hidden by a force barrier/hologram projection.
There is a long row of metallic slabs suspended about a meter above the
floor; on each lies a defunct robot. Each one wears clothing from a time
far earlier than the next. Questor's creator lies on the second to last
slab, still conscious but unable to move.

  These robots have been watching over the human race for more than ten
thousand years. Each one lasts two hundred years, then builds his successor.
Questor's predecessor was brought to an early end by some combination of
pollution and radiation exposure; he has provided Questor with extra
shielding so he will last the full two centuries.

  Questor is the last. By the end of his term, the human race will have
reached a point where we can make our own decisions without guidance.
The robots were placed here by some advanced aliens to see us through our
racial childhood, to allow us a chance to mature and achieve whatever
potential we have.

  The Questor Tapes was an excellent movie, one makers of more recent films
should take a lesson from. Very few other movies have impressed me as much
as "2001: A Space Odyssey" and "The Questor Tapes". They show up the likes
of"Close Encounters of the Third Kind" and "E.T." for the vapid silliness
they are.

By far the best thing I have read by MJH is a long short story called
"Running Down", about a man with unwanted psychic powers that cause things
to malfunction, decay and fall apart around him. It is set in a Britain
in the near future of when the story was written (i.e. about now) in which
the whole society reflects a similar dingy, pointless chaos - remarkably
like Britain after 8 years of Thatcher, in fact.
He's very good at describing that sort of situation - his novel "The Centauri
Device" does it at length, though his suggested political solution is bloody
stupid. His understanding of anarchism is about on a level with Robert Anton
Wilson's.

Tippett moved on a LONG way musically after "A Child Of Our Time".
I believe his masterpiece is the Triple Concerto for violin, viola and cello.
There is a wonderful recording of it by Pauk, Imai and Kirschbaum with the LSO
under Davis.
A problem I find with a lot of his music is the silly words. The man really
shouldn't have tried writing his own libretti that often.
I believe he's got another opera in the pipeline, due for its premiere in the
next few months.

OK - I've changed my spinning watch back into the lovely sand-timer
(remember the good old days?);  I've changed the CURS resource in the
Finder and also in the System so that I have various quantities
of sand in the top & bottom, but there is still a watch lurking!

More precisely, where does the watch that says 9 o'clock live, as
now I get the magic watch followed by the sand1->7, then the watch
again as the cycle repeats.  This only happens in the Finder, so I
suspect that there must be a watch lurking elsewhere, but where?

Last weekend a friend and I strolled into a music shop and ended up playing
with the new Casio MG500 MIDI guitar linked into a Roland MT-32. I don't
play guitar, and was just along for the curiosity, but I've got a few comments
to make and a question about what I consider to be a MIDI bug in one of the
instruments.
   Firstly - the performance of the MG500. I wasn't actually playing it (I was
just pushing buttons on the MT-32 instead), but I was impressed with its
speed and tracking ability - it was fast and followed pitch accurately,
responding to pitch bend and so on; it generally sounded pretty tight.
There were a couple of things I didn't like - but maybe it's a generic
weakness of all guitar-to-MIDI systems. Firstly, the guitar transmits
velocity information (hit the string harder -> louder/brighter note), but
gives no control (other than pitch-bend) once a note's sounding - there's
nothing equivalent to aftertouch/modulation so once a note sounds you're
at the mercy of the synth until you stop the string.
Point two - You've got six strings, so you can only sound six synth voices.
This is probably obvious, but playing a guitar patch through MIDI doesn't
sound like a real guitar, because each touch of a string retriggers the voice
on that string, sometimes in a rather distracting way. On a real (classical)
guitar you have the resonance of the soundbox to hang on to notes so you
aren't aware of this (I presume - comments?)
Now for what is (in my opinion) a MIDI Bug! Play two different notes on
two strings and you get two voices - ok so far. Play the same note on two
different strings and you get one voice. Humm. Play two different notes on
two strings and slide one note up to the other, and one of the voices is
chopped off. I think this is a bug - something somewhere doesn't want to
the same note more than once. Needless to say, this completely screws up
a number of guitar chords.
   We mentioned this to the guy in the shop. He seemed convinced that it's
a problem with the MIDI spec. itself - if you play a keyboard synth, you
have to release the middle C key to play it again, don't you? I think this
is a load of dingos kidneys - if I send my D-50 two separate middle C
note on messages, then I'll get two voices cycling through the envelopes at
middle C pitch. This is what happens with the sustain pedal on, as well.
   What's the verdict, net people? I think the guy was wrong (quite adamant,
but wrong...) and there's a bug in one of the boxes. I suspect the MG500.
If the MT-32 is anything like the D-50, then it doesn't care about playing
the same note twice. (A quick note in passing that synths with less voices
(Juno106 for instance) often won't double a voice, in an attempt to play
chords properly without running out.)

You might try looking to see if K-Resource is still available (by Kuma Software,
who else?).  It's been out a long while.  It's now available bundled with some
of the MetaComCo stuff (in particular the new Lattice C) but I believe that
Kuma still do it separately as well.  Don't have a clue what it costs, but
must be cheaper than a new compiler.

It produces (by switch option) appropriate 'include' type files for C,
FORTRAN, and 2 other languages which I've conveniently forgotten -- in
addition to the expected .RSC file.  Will also produce a 'non-specific
structured description' file (they say, I've never tried this) which is
alleged to be pretty easy to massage into an appropriate 'include' for
any unsupported language you might like.

The documentation is written in a bit of a 'too-folksy' style for my liking,
but the program is pretty intuitive to use which makes up for some of that.
It does, however, assume that you have some sort of a clue as to what the
various resource items/flags mean and do -- it doesn't teach you how to use
RSC files or what they mean, but rather gives a handle for making them.

I think I have found a bug in the latest version of Gulam.

         alias test 'echo $<'

produces a couple of spurious charcters on the input line.

         $<%&

The characters are usually above $80. The alpha version didn't do this.
I just delete them by backspacing anyway.

         echo $<

by itself works fine.

	Being curious, as the name was completely new to me, I borrowed 
	the Hyperion CD of Durufle's Requiem from my local public 
	library. I enjoyed it very much and would like to find out more
	about him, so :-

	- What else has he written? (I believe he's not been very prolific)
	
	- What else has been recorded?
	
	- Is his other work similar to the Requiem; it is better, worse or
	  just different?

	- I thought I heard a Holst influence; is this typical?

	- Are there other 20th Century composers in a similar vein that I
	  should try?

	lots of stuff about how to install smail deleted.

I have just installed smail 2.5 on Xenix 386.  The solution I used
here was to replace /usr/lib/mail/execmail with a link to (copy of)
/bin/smail.  I also moved the old sco execmail to execmail.sco and used
it as the local delivery agent.  The above will not work as it stands
because the command syntax for execmail is not the same as smail. This
can be corrected by swapping the meaning of the -F and -f switches in
smail (main.c and defs.h).   The local delivery macro in defs.h should
be set to give /usr/lib/mail/execmail.com -f from to.   With this
setup you get the sco mailer (mailx) and smail with both From and From:
lines correct.  Also as execmail is still used for 'local' delivery
micnet (sco's RS232 "LAN") still works.

This least-squares fit still passes through the "center of gravity" of the
data points, so assume that the data has been reduced such that the
averages of the x- and y-coordinates are both zero.  Let the equation of
the line to be determined be

    x*(sin phi) - y*(cos phi) = 0,

that is, it is the line making an angle phi with the x-axis.  Put

    XX = SUM_i x[i]^2,
    XY = SUM_i x[i]*y[i],
    YY = SUM_i y[i]^2.

Then tan(2*phi) = 2*XY/(XX-YY).

This gives two solutions for phi.  Take the one such that the point
(XX-YY, 2*XY) lies on the ray through the origin with angle 2*phi.
(Remark.  It is possible to solve the coefficients for x and y
algebraically, without going through the arctan routine, but it is harder
then to get the signs correct.)

The question was asked why an ARSA controller might want to know your
destination.

Actually, what they really want to know is where you're going *now*, like
'direct PMD' or 'following I5 northbound' (I have *no* idea of what type of
airspace that will take you through at any given altitude) or whatever course,
heading, or whatever you intend to take through the ARSA.

Now, if you're going to get flight following, the controller is going to want
to know your complete route of flight for which you want flight following,
so that it can be entered into the machine and the autumated handoffs can be
used between sectors and facilities.

As for why, that's very simple.  For purposes of calling traffic, which I
consider to be sufficient, if no one else does.  The same reason the
controller at the VFR tower asks your direction of departure.  If nothing
else, the controller can always tell the left downwind departures 'traffic a
(whatever) reported 6 SE for a left base entry', or whatever is appropriate.

MY opinions ONLY!

        Don't forget the special treads which would appear on his tires

        Every now and then, I remember that they would add a new option
        (boy, don't you wish your friendly neighborhood dealership would
         offer some of these for your car?).  Unfortunately, it has been
        many years since I last saw Speed Racer, but I do remember one 
        episode which added little winglets which would come out from under-
        neath the doors.  This added a little gliding ability.  Any one

       - Ultraman was one of several incredibly popular shows in Japan during
         the late 60s/early 70s/early 80s.  Actually, there were several shows
         each featuring one or more of the "Ultra" brothers, of whom Ultraman
         was the "leader/head/eldest (you get the idea)".  There was also
         Ultra 5 and a bunch of others which I can't remember and it would 
         take a long time to dig out the books.  There was something of a
         revival when UltraMan 80 (?) was released in Japan.  

         Of these, I believe that only the original Ultraman was released
         and dubbed for the American market.

       - By the way, Hayata would be the way to spell his name (though it
         would be more accurately pronounced by you gaijin as "Hiyata".
         
       - Of course, there is nary a trace of him now in Japan.  Programs
         have this incredible tendency of grabbing hold of everyone, then
         they drop it for something new.

I have encountered a problem trying to make a shell script that would
make incremental backups at nighttime without operator attendance.
The problem results from dump(8) program requiring occasional
responses from the operator through /dev/tty.  The script is
run from another script, /usr/adm/daily, under cron control and has no
controlling terminal, so it just hangs trying to read /dev/tty.  It would
be ok if dump just aborted when facing a situation that would require
operator intervention. The script should never hang in a loop under
any circumstances, because /usr/adm/daily must do other things too
and finish after a reasonable time.

Currently I have the dump script run a background subshell that sleeps for
an hour and then kills the dump script (if it still runs) and all dump
processes.  This is very complicated, however, and the watchdog process
is almost 50% of the whole script.  It is also very slow - I would
like it to stop immediately if it finds an error, report it to log file,
rewind the tape, and let /usr/adm/daily continue its work.

Has anyone out there in the Netland have any suggestions of what to do?
Can yes(1) somehow be piped to a program that reads /dev/tty?
Could dump(8) be modified to abort at errors without any questions?
What kind of unattended backup systems do you have?

I think that these wines would be particularly bad for sauces that require
wine as a major component and require reducing the wine. There are two
reasons that come to mind:

1) What is normally labeled as cooking wine is usually wine that is not good
enough to sell as table wine. If the taste is not the best, reducing it will
only concentrate its flaws.

2) Cooking wines contain salt. Reducing a cooking wine will concentrate the
salt. This could really ruin the sauce. 

There best reason I have seen for using a good wine to cook with was given
by Alexis Bespaloff in the "New Signet Book of Wine", which states

 "Furthermore, it is actually uneconomical to buy cheap wine for cooking.
  Say that an elaborate lobster dish calls for a spoonful or two of sherry
  to heighten its flavor. A cook who runs out to buy a bottle of cheap
  sherry will diminish the taste of an expensive and time-consuming dish with
  a quarter's worth of wine. What's more, because the wine is a poor example
  of its type, it may not be enjoyable to drink, so the spoonful of wine has,
  in fact, cost the full price of the bottle."

That is fairly sound reasoning. Of course, the last sentence does not
necessarily follow. You could keep the cheap wine around to diminish several
meals.

BTW, I recommend the "New Signet Book of Wine" to anyone who wants to learn
more about wine. It is available for $4.50 as a paperback. Quite a value
when you compare it to the $20-or-more, glossy coffee-table wine books out
on the market.

My friend told me that they said "Tales.. is not on CD." That's why he didn't

I have just finished singing (in choir) under Hogwood, it was an experience. We
sang Schuberts Mass in G, (as Schubert wrote it, missing a few phrases of the
Credo). Hogwood knew exactly what he wanted, and worked till we did it right.
Then as we tidied up the last few problems, he would let us sing through whole
sections, then go back and point out all the problems.

We also sang the Messiah (not with Hogwood unfortunately) the delight of
those performances was Elizabeth Cambells singing "He was despised..."

In this performance the two trumpeters waited off stage until just before their
appearances in each half, the first trumpet parts were played by a large
trumpeter (in nice to see that Sydney musicains are not starving) on what
looked like a very small valved trumpet (trumpet in F??).

1) Mr. Konar, press the 'n' key immediately! There's another arrogant
   audiophile going to pollute the net with his view on the Digital vs.
   Analog issue.

2) I'm not very much acquainted with the news stuff on the net, but it
   seems we don't receive the rec.audio newsgroup here in Europe. Can
   something be done about that?

3) Now let me come to the point.
   In article <3051@batcomputer.tn.cornell.edu> eacj@batcomputer.tn.cornell
   (Julian Vrieslander) he writes:
>Konar than goes on to comment about the "arrogance" of audiophiles who still

I agree with him, so let me do my bit now. A technology not being perfect
, or getting close to that, is still worth a discussion. Remember that it
took about a 100 years of thorough research from Edison's first grammophone
to the modern high quality turntables. Don't expect digital audio to be
perfect now only a few years after its introduction, no matter what the
commercial guys say. They are only interested in your hard-earned $$$$.

Until now I have only been in the opportunity to make a good comparison
between a high-end turntable and some first genaration. I'll summarize
the pros and cons of which I think are important and which I can think of
now. Many of them are well known, others may not.

PROS OF ANALOG:
- Cheap records.
- As John Vrieslander mentioned: More real, more spatious, more delicate,
  more emotionally involving. I won't try to find other words for this
  description 'cause I can't think of a better one. Unfortunately, this
  can only be heard on good, say > $2k-$3k systems without an infinite
  number of knobs, lights and other gadgets normally found in aeroplane
  cockpits.

CONS OF ANALOG:
- More hissy, rumble,scratches,sound degrading after many times of
  playing the record. This counts less when you have good records
  (Japanese ones are most often excellent but hard to get now.) and take
  good care of them.
- No flat frequency response, especially at the low and high end.
- Phase distortion.
- Harmonic distortion increases with amplitude.

PROS OF DIGITAL:
- Longer durability than records (?). Less hissy, no rumble or ticks of
  scratches.
- Almost no phase distortion, flat frequency response within the audio
  range.
- Easy to use.
- Slightly (!) more dynamic. Why only slightly? Well, the 96 dB dynamic
  range theoretically possible with a CD is not very practical. In reality
  it is compressed, as far as I know, to some 40-60 dB depending on the
  music (Pop, Jazz, Classic) because:
  a) No one wants to run continuously to his volume knob to adjust the
     volume.If not compressed the music will either be banging through your 
     living room and of your neighbours or it will drown in the inevitable 
     background noise.
  b) Studio equipment has a dynamic range of less than, say, 70 to 80 dB
     when you assume the Signal to Noise ratio being equal to the dynamic
     range.
  c) Sound gets to distorted at low levels. (See also cons)
  d) A dynamic headroom of 10 dB is desired.
  With all this limitations the dynamic range of CD's is not much different
  with that of a good record.
- Excellent bass response. Deep and well defined.
- Very stable stereo image.

CONS OF DIGITAL:
- Expensive records.
- When listening to a CD, it seems as if there is no "space" around around
  the instruments and voices. It sounds cold and not very lively.
- First generation players and the cheaper CD players nowadays suffer from
  very distorted high tones. They sound harsh. Cymbals for instance sound
  like someone is sawing them into pieces instead giving it a gentle hit
  with a drum-stick. They do not sound crisp and clear.
- Distortion increases dramatically with lower amplitudes (!). It can be
  more than 1.5 % at low levels. And it's a very nasty kind of distortion.
- CD players produce (digital) noise above the audio range. This noise itself
  can not be heard but other audio equipment may suffer from intermodulation
  distortion which brings this noise back in the audio range. 
- Many CD players, especially the first ones, do not seem to be very reliable
  mechanically.
- I've heard that digital audio recording is quite different from analog.
  I mean in terms of how it has to be done properly. I don't mean the
  equipment needed, that's quite obvious. Not all studio crew seem to know
  how to make a good digital recording. Does anyone know more about that?

Well, this must be enough stuff to think and talk about.

The above mentioned cons of digital audio may be overcome in the latest
players but I have not had the opportunity until now to carefully listen
to them and to compare them. According to some serious audio magazines
available here in Holland they seem to be improved. Many top-of-the-line
models now have separated power supplys for the digital and analog
circuitry, opto-couplers between those circuits, an additional analog filter
to filter out > 20 kHz noise, 16 bit with with n times oversampling, stable
and rigid chassis and improved error correction. All this may have solved
(some) of the cons I mentioned but I'm not sure. Players which have one or
more of these improvements and thus may be of interest (At least for Julian
Vrieslander and me) are: Philips (Magnavox in the USA I believe) CD 650 and
CD 960, Nakamichi, Mission, Meridian and if memory serves me well, Acoustical
Research (Or Audio Research. Don't know anymore). The latter two may be
difficult to get in the USA, they are made in the UK. No doubt that there
are more good CD players but can't think of others now. These are the
players I consider buying when normal LP's are no longer available.

Pooh! That was more than I intended to write but still far less than I can
tell about this stuff.

                                        Kind regards from
                                        Jan Postma

Using the  GNU emacs terminal-emulator   to run interactive  programs  would be
quite limited if the parent emacs  can't be used  for editing (when the program
run under the emulator starts up an editor).  While some  programs  (like `rn')
allow to explicitely specify the  editor, a general  solution would require  to
specify `emacsclient'  in the `EDITOR'   environment  variable of  the  process
running under the terminal emulator.

Naturally this could be done by running  the  shell under the emulator, setting
the   environment of  the shell, and  then running   the program  we are really
interested  in.  A  better way  would be    to set  the   environment from  the
`terminal-mode-hook'. Is there any means to achieve this???? (I'm running GNU
Emacs version 18.49.)

No, why should they? There may be songs on the album that are 
very good listening to at home, but just doesn't make it live,
just as there are songs with the opposite character; good live, 
but just a bore on disc.

Deep Purple and Marillion and good example of extremes in both
ends. When I saw D.P. in February this year, they played three 
of the ten songs from "The House of Blue Light", their latest 
album. That is a quite decent product, but I didn't miss those
songs anyway. (I, and everyone else, would have been much more 
disappointed if they had left out "Smoke on the Water".) 
  Marillion on the other hand; on the two tours they made after
"Misplaced Childhood", they insisted on playing entire album
as one long song. There are many parts on that album that just
becomes dead passages where nothing happens when they are played
live. ("Bitter Suite" and "Blind Curve" for instance.) Marillion
is no good live band, and playing obsolete material does not
make things better.

Grady seems to be confusing the issue a bit here. He talks about fusion and 
the mentions groups that belong(ed) to the symphonic-rock genre. (I prefer
that term instead of "progressive") For me "fusion" is a synonym with 
jazz-rock. Anyway, that is more of question of semantics, the two genres 
have a lot in common. (The main difference maybe being that symphony-rock 
is European and fusion American.)

The reason why these groups are being discussed the most is probably that
they have gained the greatest commercial succes. This may or may not 
be correlated to the fact they are the best.

Being quite fond of this kind of music, I feel obliged to comment. It's
a real mixture Grady presents and I must admit there are names I have 
never heard. Anyway, I think he is a bit unfair, some of them have 
certainly been discussed on the net. For instance, I posted a discograhpy 
on Brand X some month ago. Some comments to the other names:
  PFM (Premiata Forneria Marconi) have been mentioned from time to time,
the Italian answer on Genesis, which developed in a different way. Now
disbanded, I believe. One day or another may be I'll post a discography.
  Quiet Sun. The band in which Phil Manzanera played before he joined
Roxy Music. Their "Mainstream" is rather like jazz, but not mainstream.
  Seventh Wave. This is the name I never expected to see on the net! I
bought their "Things to Come" when I was 15 and I was really fond of it
then. These days I don't find that amount of synthesizers so exciting as
I did then.
  Wheather Report. Quite well-known. But really, you do only need "Heavy
Wheather", the one with "Birdland". May be some more, "Mysterious Traveller"
perhaps, but then you'll find that they all sound the same.

>As I said before, I find much of Yes and ELP to be very dull, and un-
>affecting.  I like Rush, though more live than on record.  

As you can guess, I don't share Grady's view here. Yes has made good
music, yet never really touched my soul, probably due to their utterly
stupid and semi-religious lyrics. "Brain Salad Surgery" is a very good
record, the rest of what ELP have done is so-so. Rush don't turn me on 
at all, on the other hand. The net discussion inspired me to try 
"A Farewell to Kings" (A random choice). May be I would have liked them 
10 years ago, but not today with those lyrics and that voice.

>So, were Yes, ELP, Pink Floyd, King Crimson, Genesis and Rush really "it"
>as far as most progrock fans go, or did some of these "lesser known" artists
>(and all the others I forgot or never knew) filter out to larger audiences?

Depends on how you define your terms here, but I can easily think 
of more groups, some of them succesful, some of them not, some of them
good, some them not so good:
Kansas, Saga, Asia, Jethro Tull, Roxy Music, Gentle Giant, Van Der Graaf
Generator, George Duke, Billy Cobham, Al DiMeola, Herbie Hancock, Dixie
Dregs, Ange, (Mahavishnu) John McLaughlin, Santana, Bill Bruford etc
  I think that most of these people have had their share of the discussion
on the net. So to conclude, I do not really share Grady's initial obser-
vation. However some particular groups are certainly being over-discussed,
namely Rush, Yes and recently also Pink Floyd.
