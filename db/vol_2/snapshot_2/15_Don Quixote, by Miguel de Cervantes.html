</p>
<p>
“That, Sancho, thou art not,” said Don Quixote; “for not
only art thou not sage silence, but thou art pestilent prate and
perversity; still I would like to know what three proverbs have just now
come into thy memory, for I have been turning over mine own—and it
is a good one—and none occurs to me.”
</p>
<p>
“What can be better,” said Sancho, “than ‘never
put thy thumbs between two back teeth;’ and ‘to “<i>get out
of my house</i>” and “<i>what do you want with my wife?</i>” there
is no answer;’ and ‘whether the pitcher hits the stone, or the
stone the pitcher, it’s a bad business for the pitcher;’ all
which fit to a hair? For no one should quarrel with his governor, or him
in authority over him, because he will come off the worst, as he does who
puts his finger between two back and if they are not back teeth it makes
no difference, so long as they are teeth; and to whatever the governor may
say there’s no answer, any more than to ‘get out of my house’
and ‘what do you want with my wife?’ and then, as for that
about the stone and the pitcher, a blind man could see that. So that he
‘who sees the mote in another’s eye had need to see the beam
in his own,’ that it be not said of himself, ‘the dead woman
was frightened at the one with her throat cut;’ and your worship
knows well that ‘the fool knows more in his own house than the wise
man in another’s.’”
</p>
<p>
“Nay, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “the fool knows
nothing, either in his own house or in anybody else’s, for no wise
structure of any sort can stand on a foundation of folly; but let us say
no more about it, Sancho, for if thou governest badly, thine will be the
fault and mine the shame; but I comfort myself with having done my duty in
advising thee as earnestly and as wisely as I could; and thus I am
released from my obligations and my promise. God guide thee, Sancho, and
govern thee in thy government, and deliver me from the misgiving I have
that thou wilt turn the whole island upside down, a thing I might easily
prevent by explaining to the duke what thou art and telling him that all
that fat little person of thine is nothing else but a sack full of
proverbs and sauciness.”
</p>
<p>
“Señor,” said Sancho, “if your worship thinks I’m
not fit for this government, I give it up on the spot; for the mere black
of the nail of my soul is dearer to me than my whole body; and I can live
just as well, simple Sancho, on bread and onions, as governor, on
partridges and capons; and what’s more, while we’re asleep we’re
all equal, great and small, rich and poor. But if your worship looks into
it, you will see it was your worship alone that put me on to this business
of governing; for I know no more about the government of islands than a
buzzard; and if there’s any reason to think that because of my being
a governor the devil will get hold of me, I’d rather go Sancho to
heaven than governor to hell.”
</p>
<p>
“By God, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “for those last
words thou hast uttered alone, I consider thou deservest to be governor of
a thousand islands. Thou hast good natural instincts, without which no
knowledge is worth anything; commend thyself to God, and try not to swerve
in the pursuit of thy main object; I mean, always make it thy aim and
fixed purpose to do right in all matters that come before thee, for heaven
always helps good intentions; and now let us go to dinner, for I think my
lord and lady are waiting for us.”

<p>
It is stated, they say, in the true original of this history, that when
Cide Hamete came to write this chapter, his interpreter did not translate
it as he wrote it—that is, as a kind of complaint the Moor made
against himself for having taken in hand a story so dry and of so little
variety as this of Don Quixote, for he found himself forced to speak
perpetually of him and Sancho, without venturing to indulge in digressions
and episodes more serious and more interesting. He said, too, that to go
on, mind, hand, pen always restricted to writing upon one single subject,
and speaking through the mouths of a few characters, was intolerable
drudgery, the result of which was never equal to the author’s
labour, and that to avoid this he had in the First Part availed himself of
the device of novels, like “The Ill-advised Curiosity,” and
“The Captive Captain,” which stand, as it were, apart from the
story; the others are given there being incidents which occurred to Don
Quixote himself and could not be omitted. He also thought, he says, that
many, engrossed by the interest attaching to the exploits of Don Quixote,
would take none in the novels, and pass them over hastily or impatiently
without noticing the elegance and art of their composition, which would be
very manifest were they published by themselves and not as mere adjuncts
to the crazes of Don Quixote or the simplicities of Sancho. Therefore in
this Second Part he thought it best not to insert novels, either separate
or interwoven, but only episodes, something like them, arising out of the
circumstances the facts present; and even these sparingly, and with no
more words than suffice to make them plain; and as he confines and
restricts himself to the narrow limits of the narrative, though he has
ability; capacity, and brains enough to deal with the whole universe, he
requests that his labours may not be despised, and that credit be given
him, not alone for what he writes, but for what he has refrained from
writing.
</p>
<p>
And so he goes on with his story, saying that the day Don Quixote gave the
counsels to Sancho, the same afternoon after dinner he handed them to him
in writing so that he might get someone to read them to him. They had
scarcely, however, been given to him when he let them drop, and they fell
into the hands of the duke, who showed them to the duchess and they were
both amazed afresh at the madness and wit of Don Quixote. To carry on the
joke, then, the same evening they despatched Sancho with a large following
to the village that was to serve him for an island. It happened that the
person who had him in charge was a majordomo of the duke’s, a man of
great discretion and humour—and there can be no humour without
discretion—and the same who played the part of the Countess Trifaldi
in the comical way that has been already described; and thus qualified,
and instructed by his master and mistress as to how to deal with Sancho,
he carried out their scheme admirably. Now it came to pass that as soon as
Sancho saw this majordomo he seemed in his features to recognise those of
the Trifaldi, and turning to his master, he said to him, “Señor,
either the devil will carry me off, here on this spot, righteous and
believing, or your worship will own to me that the face of this majordomo
of the duke’s here is the very face of the Distressed One.”
</p>
<p>
Don Quixote regarded the majordomo attentively, and having done so, said
to Sancho, “There is no reason why the devil should carry thee off,
Sancho, either righteous or believing—and what thou meanest by that
I know not; the face of the Distressed One is that of the majordomo, but
for all that the majordomo is not the Distressed One; for his being so
would involve a mighty contradiction; but this is not the time for going
into questions of the sort, which would be involving ourselves in an
inextricable labyrinth. Believe me, my friend, we must pray earnestly to
our Lord that he deliver us both from wicked wizards and enchanters.”
</p>
<p>
“It is no joke, señor,” said Sancho, “for before this I
heard him speak, and it seemed exactly as if the voice of the Trifaldi was
sounding in my ears. Well, I’ll hold my peace; but I’ll take
care to be on the look-out henceforth for any sign that may be seen to
confirm or do away with this suspicion.”
</p>
<p>
“Thou wilt do well, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “and thou
wilt let me know all thou discoverest, and all that befalls thee in thy
government.”
</p>
<p>
Sancho at last set out attended by a great number of people. He was
dressed in the garb of a lawyer, with a gaban of tawny watered camlet over
all and a montera cap of the same material, and mounted a la gineta upon a
mule. Behind him, in accordance with the duke’s orders, followed
Dapple with brand new ass-trappings and ornaments of silk, and from time
to time Sancho turned round to look at his ass, so well pleased to have
him with him that he would not have changed places with the emperor of
Germany. On taking leave he kissed the hands of the duke and duchess and
got his master’s blessing, which Don Quixote gave him with tears,
and he received blubbering.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<div class="fig" style="width:60%;">

</p>
<p>
Let worthy Sancho go in peace, and good luck to him, Gentle Reader; and
look out for two bushels of laughter, which the account of how he behaved
himself in office will give thee. In the meantime turn thy attention to
what happened his master the same night, and if thou dost not laugh
thereat, at any rate thou wilt stretch thy mouth with a grin; for Don
Quixote’s adventures must be honoured either with wonder or with
laughter.
</p>
<p>
It is recorded, then, that as soon as Sancho had gone, Don Quixote felt
his loneliness, and had it been possible for him to revoke the mandate and
take away the government from him he would have done so. The duchess
observed his dejection and asked him why he was melancholy; because, she
said, if it was for the loss of Sancho, there were squires, duennas, and
damsels in her house who would wait upon him to his full satisfaction.
</p>
<p>
“The truth is, señora,” replied Don Quixote, “that I do
feel the loss of Sancho; but that is not the main cause of my looking sad;
and of all the offers your excellence makes me, I accept only the
good-will with which they are made, and as to the remainder I entreat of
your excellence to permit and allow me alone to wait upon myself in my
chamber.”
</p>
<p>
“Indeed, Señor Don Quixote,” said the duchess, “that
must not be; four of my damsels, as beautiful as flowers, shall wait upon
you.”
</p>
<p>
“To me,” said Don Quixote, “they will not be flowers,
but thorns to pierce my heart. They, or anything like them, shall as soon
enter my chamber as fly. If your highness wishes to gratify me still
further, though I deserve it not, permit me to please myself, and wait
upon myself in my own room; for I place a barrier between my inclinations
and my virtue, and I do not wish to break this rule through the generosity
your highness is disposed to display towards me; and, in short, I will
sleep in my clothes, sooner than allow anyone to undress me.”
</p>
<p>
“Say no more, Señor Don Quixote, say no more,” said the
duchess; “I assure you I will give orders that not even a fly, not
to say a damsel, shall enter your room. I am not the one to undermine the
propriety of Señor Don Quixote, for it strikes me that among his many
virtues the one that is pre-eminent is that of modesty. Your worship may
undress and dress in private and in your own way, as you please and when
you please, for there will be no one to hinder you; and in your chamber
you will find all the utensils requisite to supply the wants of one who
sleeps with his door locked, to the end that no natural needs compel you
to open it. May the great Dulcinea del Toboso live a thousand years, and
may her fame extend all over the surface of the globe, for she deserves to
be loved by a knight so valiant and so virtuous; and may kind heaven
infuse zeal into the heart of our governor Sancho Panza to finish off his
discipline speedily, so that the world may once more enjoy the beauty of
so grand a lady.”
</p>
<p>
To which Don Quixote replied, “Your highness has spoken like what
you are; from the mouth of a noble lady nothing bad can come; and Dulcinea
will be more fortunate, and better known to the world by the praise of
your highness than by all the eulogies the greatest orators on earth could
bestow upon her.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, well, Señor Don Quixote,” said the duchess, it is
nearly supper-time, and the duke is probably waiting; come let us go to
supper, and retire to rest early, for the journey you made yesterday from
Kandy was not such a short one but that it must have caused you some
fatigue.”
</p>
<p>
“I feel none, señora,” said Don Quixote, “for I would go
so far as to swear to your excellence that in all my life I never mounted
a quieter beast, or a pleasanter paced one, than Clavileño; and I don’t
know what could have induced Malambruno to discard a steed so swift and so
gentle, and burn it so recklessly as he did.”
</p>
<p>
“Probably,” said the duchess, “repenting of the evil he
had done to the Trifaldi and company, and others, and the crimes he must
have committed as a wizard and enchanter, he resolved to make away with
all the instruments of his craft; and so burned Clavileño as the chief
one, and that which mainly kept him restless, wandering from land to land;
and by its ashes and the trophy of the placard the valour of the great Don
Quixote of La Mancha is established for ever.”
</p>
<p>
Don Quixote renewed his thanks to the duchess; and having supped, retired
to his chamber alone, refusing to allow anyone to enter with him to wait
on him, such was his fear of encountering temptations that might lead or
drive him to forget his chaste fidelity to his lady Dulcinea; for he had
always present to his mind the virtue of Amadis, that flower and mirror of
knights-errant. He locked the door behind him, and by the light of two wax
candles undressed himself, but as he was taking off his stockings—O
disaster unworthy of such a personage!—there came a burst, not of
sighs, or anything belying his delicacy or good breeding, but of some two
dozen stitches in one of his stockings, that made it look like a
window-lattice. The worthy gentleman was beyond measure distressed, and at
that moment he would have given an ounce of silver to have had half a
drachm of green silk there; I say green silk, because the stockings were
green.
</p>
<p>
Here Cide Hamete exclaimed as he was writing, “O poverty, poverty! I
know not what could have possessed the great Cordovan poet to call thee
‘holy gift ungratefully received.’ Although a Moor, I know
well enough from the intercourse I have had with Christians that holiness
consists in charity, humility, faith, obedience, and poverty; but for all
that, I say he must have a great deal of godliness who can find any
satisfaction in being poor; unless, indeed, it be the kind of poverty one
of their greatest saints refers to, saying, ‘possess all things as
though ye possessed them not;’ which is what they call poverty in
spirit. But thou, that other poverty—for it is of thee I am speaking
now—why dost thou love to fall out with gentlemen and men of good
birth more than with other people? Why dost thou compel them to smear the
cracks in their shoes, and to have the buttons of their coats, one silk,
another hair, and another glass? Why must their ruffs be always crinkled
like endive leaves, and not crimped with a crimping iron?” (From
this we may perceive the antiquity of starch and crimped ruffs.) Then he
goes on: “Poor gentleman of good family! always cockering up his
honour, dining miserably and in secret, and making a hypocrite of the
toothpick with which he sallies out into the street after eating nothing
to oblige him to use it! Poor fellow, I say, with his nervous honour,
fancying they perceive a league off the patch on his shoe, the
sweat-stains on his hat, the shabbiness of his cloak, and the hunger of
his stomach!”
</p>
<p>
All this was brought home to Don Quixote by the bursting of his stitches;
however, he comforted himself on perceiving that Sancho had left behind a
pair of travelling boots, which he resolved to wear the next day. At last
he went to bed, out of spirits and heavy at heart, as much because he
missed Sancho as because of the irreparable disaster to his stockings, the
stitches of which he would have even taken up with silk of another colour,
which is one of the greatest signs of poverty a gentleman can show in the
course of his never-failing embarrassments. He put out the candles; but
the night was warm and he could not sleep; he rose from his bed and opened
slightly a grated window that looked out on a beautiful garden, and as he
did so he perceived and heard people walking and talking in the garden. He
set himself to listen attentively, and those below raised their voices so
that he could hear these words:
</p>
<p>
“Urge me not to sing, Emerencia, for thou knowest that ever since
this stranger entered the castle and my eyes beheld him, I cannot sing but
only weep; besides my lady is a light rather than a heavy sleeper, and I
would not for all the wealth of the world that she found us here; and even
if she were asleep and did not waken, my singing would be in vain, if this
strange Æneas, who has come into my neighbourhood to flout me, sleeps on
and wakens not to hear it.”
</p>
<p>
“Heed not that, dear Altisidora,” replied a voice; “the
duchess is no doubt asleep, and everybody in the house save the lord of
thy heart and disturber of thy soul; for just now I perceived him open the
grated window of his chamber, so he must be awake; sing, my poor sufferer,
in a low sweet tone to the accompaniment of thy harp; and even if the
duchess hears us we can lay the blame on the heat of the night.”
</p>
<p>
“That is not the point, Emerencia,” replied Altisidora,
“it is that I would not that my singing should lay bare my heart,
and that I should be thought a light and wanton maiden by those who know
not the mighty power of love; but come what may; better a blush on the
cheeks than a sore in the heart;” and here a harp softly touched
made itself heard. As he listened to all this Don Quixote was in a state
of breathless amazement, for immediately the countless adventures like
this, with windows, gratings, gardens, serenades, lovemakings, and
languishings, that he had read of in his trashy books of chivalry, came to
his mind. He at once concluded that some damsel of the duchess’s was
in love with him, and that her modesty forced her to keep her passion
secret. He trembled lest he should fall, and made an inward resolution not
to yield; and commending himself with all his might and soul to his lady
Dulcinea he made up his mind to listen to the music; and to let them know
he was there he gave a pretended sneeze, at which the damsels were not a
little delighted, for all they wanted was that Don Quixote should hear
them. So having tuned the harp, Altisidora, running her hand across the
strings, began this ballad:
</p>
<p class="poem">
O thou that art above in bed,<br>
    Between the holland sheets,<br>
A-lying there from night till morn,<br>
    With outstretched legs asleep;<br>
<br>
O thou, most valiant knight of all<br>
    The famed Manchegan breed,<br>
Of purity and virtue more<br>
    Than gold of Araby;<br>
<br>
Give ear unto a suffering maid,<br>
    Well-grown but evil-starr’d,<br>
For those two suns of thine have lit<br>
    A fire within her heart.<br>
<br>
Adventures seeking thou dost rove,<br>
    To others bringing woe;<br>
Thou scatterest wounds, but, ah, the balm<br>
    To heal them dost withhold!<br>
<br>
Say, valiant youth, and so may God<br>
    Thy enterprises speed,<br>
Didst thou the light mid Libya’s sands<br>
    Or Jaca’s rocks first see?<br>
<br>
Did scaly serpents give thee suck?<br>
    Who nursed thee when a babe?<br>
Wert cradled in the forest rude,<br>
    Or gloomy mountain cave?<br>
<br>
O Dulcinea may be proud,<br>
    That plump and lusty maid;<br>
For she alone hath had the power<br>
    A tiger fierce to tame.<br>
<br>
And she for this shall famous be<br>
    From Tagus to Jarama,<br>
From Manzanares to Genil,<br>
    From Duero to Arlanza.<br>
<br>
Fain would I change with her, and give<br>
    A petticoat to boot,<br>
The best and bravest that I have,<br>
    All trimmed with gold galloon.<br>
<br>
O for to be the happy fair<br>
    Thy mighty arms enfold,<br>
Or even sit beside thy bed<br>
    And scratch thy dusty poll!<br>
<br>
I rave,—to favours such as these<br>
    Unworthy to aspire;<br>
Thy feet to tickle were enough<br>
    For one so mean as I.<br>
<br>
What caps, what slippers silver-laced,<br>
    Would I on thee bestow!<br>
What damask breeches make for thee;<br>
    What fine long holland cloaks!<br>
<br>
And I would give thee pearls that should<br>
    As big as oak-galls show;<br>
So matchless big that each might well<br>
    Be called the great “Alone.”<br>
<br>
Manchegan Nero, look not down<br>
    From thy Tarpeian Rock<br>
Upon this burning heart, nor add<br>
    The fuel of thy wrath.<br>
<br>
A virgin soft and young am I,<br>
    Not yet fifteen years old;<br>
(I’m only three months past fourteen,<br>
    I swear upon my soul).<br>
<br>
I hobble not nor do I limp,<br>
    All blemish I’m without,<br>
And as I walk my lily locks<br>
    Are trailing on the ground.<br>
<br>
And though my nose be rather flat,<br>
    And though my mouth be wide,<br>
My teeth like topazes exalt<br>
    My beauty to the sky.<br>
<br>
Thou knowest that my voice is sweet,<br>
    That is if thou dost hear;<br>
And I am moulded in a form<br>
    Somewhat below the mean.<br>
<br>
These charms, and many more, are thine,<br>
    Spoils to thy spear and bow all;<br>
A damsel of this house am I,<br>
    By name Altisidora.<br>

<p>
Here the lay of the heart-stricken Altisidora came to an end, while the
warmly wooed Don Quixote began to feel alarm; and with a deep sigh he said
to himself, “O that I should be such an unlucky knight that no
damsel can set eyes on me but falls in love with me! O that the peerless
Dulcinea should be so unfortunate that they cannot let her enjoy my
incomparable constancy in peace! What would ye with her, ye queens? Why do
ye persecute her, ye empresses? Why ye pursue her, ye virgins of from
fourteen to fifteen? Leave the unhappy being to triumph, rejoice and glory
in the lot love has been pleased to bestow upon her in surrendering my
heart and yielding up my soul to her. Ye love-smitten host, know that to
Dulcinea only I am dough and sugar-paste, flint to all others; for her I
am honey, for you aloes. For me Dulcinea alone is beautiful, wise,
virtuous, graceful, and high-bred, and all others are ill-favoured,
foolish, light, and low-born. Nature sent me into the world to be hers and
no other’s; Altisidora may weep or sing, the lady for whose sake
they belaboured me in the castle of the enchanted Moor may give way to
despair, but I must be Dulcinea’s, boiled or roast, pure, courteous,
and chaste, in spite of all the magic-working powers on earth.” And
with that he shut the window with a bang, and, as much out of temper and
out of sorts as if some great misfortune had befallen him, stretched
himself on his bed, where we will leave him for the present, as the great
Sancho Panza, who is about to set up his famous government, now demands
our attention.

O perpetual discoverer of the antipodes, torch of the world, eye of
heaven, sweet stimulator of the water-coolers! Thimbraeus here, Phœbus
there, now archer, now physician, father of poetry, inventor of music;
thou that always risest and, notwithstanding appearances, never settest!
To thee, O Sun, by whose aid man begetteth man, to thee I appeal to help
me and lighten the darkness of my wit that I may be able to proceed with
scrupulous exactitude in giving an account of the great Sancho Panza’s
government; for without thee I feel myself weak, feeble, and uncertain.
</p>
<p>
To come to the point, then—Sancho with all his attendants arrived at
a village of some thousand inhabitants, and one of the largest the duke
possessed. They informed him that it was called the island of Barataria,
either because the name of the village was Baratario, or because of the
joke by way of which the government had been conferred upon him. On
reaching the gates of the town, which was a walled one, the municipality
came forth to meet him, the bells rang out a peal, and the inhabitants
showed every sign of general satisfaction; and with great pomp they
conducted him to the principal church to give thanks to God, and then with
burlesque ceremonies they presented him with the keys of the town, and
acknowledged him as perpetual governor of the island of Barataria. The
costume, the beard, and the fat squat figure of the new governor
astonished all those who were not in on the secret, and even all who were,
and they were not a few. Finally, leading him out of the church they
carried him to the judgment seat and seated him on it, and the duke’s
majordomo said to him, “It is an ancient custom in this island,
señor governor, that he who comes to take possession of this famous island
is bound to answer a question which shall be put to him, and which must be
a somewhat knotty and difficult one; and by his answer the people take the
measure of their new governor’s wit, and hail with joy or deplore
his arrival accordingly.”
</p>
<p>
While the majordomo was making this speech Sancho was gazing at several
large letters inscribed on the wall opposite his seat, and as he could not
read he asked what that was that was painted on the wall. The answer was,
“Señor, there is written and recorded the day on which your lordship
took possession of this island, and the inscription says, ‘This day,
the so-and-so of such-and-such a month and year, Señor Don Sancho Panza
took possession of this island; many years may he enjoy it.’”
</p>
<p>
“And whom do they call Don Sancho Panza?” asked Sancho.
</p>
<p>
“Your lordship,” replied the majordomo; “for no other
Panza but the one who is now seated in that chair has ever entered this
island.”
</p>
<p>
“Well then, let me tell you, brother,” said Sancho, “I
haven’t got the ‘Don,’ nor has anyone of my family ever
had it; my name is plain Sancho Panza, and Sancho was my father’s
name, and Sancho was my grandfather’s and they were all Panzas,
without any Dons or Doñas tacked on; I suspect that in this island there
are more Dons than stones; but never mind; God knows what I mean, and
maybe if my government lasts four days I’ll weed out these Dons that
no doubt are as great a nuisance as the midges, they’re so plenty.
Let the majordomo go on with his question, and I’ll give the best
answer I can, whether the people deplore or not.”
</p>
<p>
At this instant there came into court two old men, one carrying a cane by
way of a walking-stick, and the one who had no stick said, “Señor,
some time ago I lent this good man ten gold-crowns in gold to gratify him
and do him a service, on the condition that he was to return them to me
whenever I should ask for them. A long time passed before I asked for
them, for I would not put him to any greater straits to return them than
he was in when I lent them to him; but thinking he was growing careless
about payment I asked for them once and several times; and not only will
he not give them back, but he denies that he owes them, and says I never
lent him any such crowns; or if I did, that he repaid them; and I have no
witnesses either of the loan, or the payment, for he never paid me; I want
your worship to put him to his oath, and if he swears he returned them to
me I forgive him the debt here and before God.”
</p>

</p>
<p>
“What say you to this, good old man, you with the stick?” said
Sancho.
</p>
<p>
To which the old man replied, “I admit, señor, that he lent them to
me; but let your worship lower your staff, and as he leaves it to my oath,
I’ll swear that I gave them back, and paid him really and truly.”
</p>
<p>
The governor lowered the staff, and as he did so the old man who had the
stick handed it to the other old man to hold for him while he swore, as if
he found it in his way; and then laid his hand on the cross of the staff,
saying that it was true the ten crowns that were demanded of him had been
lent him; but that he had with his own hand given them back into the hand
of the other, and that he, not recollecting it, was always asking for
them.
</p>
<p>
Seeing this the great governor asked the creditor what answer he had to
make to what his opponent said. He said that no doubt his debtor had told
the truth, for he believed him to be an honest man and a good Christian,
and he himself must have forgotten when and how he had given him back the
crowns; and that from that time forth he would make no further demand upon
him.
</p>
<p>
The debtor took his stick again, and bowing his head left the court.
Observing this, and how, without another word, he made off, and observing
too the resignation of the plaintiff, Sancho buried his head in his bosom
and remained for a short space in deep thought, with the forefinger of his
right hand on his brow and nose; then he raised his head and bade them
call back the old man with the stick, for he had already taken his
departure. They brought him back, and as soon as Sancho saw him he said,
“Honest man, give me that stick, for I want it.”
</p>
<p>
“Willingly,” said the old man; “here it is señor,”
and he put it into his hand.
</p>
<p>
Sancho took it and, handing it to the other old man, said to him, “Go,
and God be with you; for now you are paid.”
</p>
<p>
“I, señor!” returned the old man; “why, is this cane
worth ten gold-crowns?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” said the governor, “or if not I am the greatest
dolt in the world; now you will see whether I have got the headpiece to
govern a whole kingdom;” and he ordered the cane to be broken in
two, there, in the presence of all. It was done, and in the middle of it
they found ten gold-crowns. All were filled with amazement, and looked
upon their governor as another Solomon. They asked him how he had come to
the conclusion that the ten crowns were in the cane; he replied, that
observing how the old man who swore gave the stick to his opponent while
he was taking the oath, and swore that he had really and truly given him
the crowns, and how as soon as he had done swearing he asked for the stick
again, it came into his head that the sum demanded must be inside it; and
from this he said it might be seen that God sometimes guides those who
govern in their judgments, even though they may be fools; besides he had
himself heard the curate of his village mention just such another case,
and he had so good a memory, that if it was not that he forgot everything
he wished to remember, there would not be such a memory in all the island.
To conclude, the old men went off, one crestfallen, and the other in high
contentment, all who were present were astonished, and he who was
recording the words, deeds, and movements of Sancho could not make up his
mind whether he was to look upon him and set him down as a fool or as a
man of sense.
</p>
<p>
As soon as this case was disposed of, there came into court a woman
holding on with a tight grip to a man dressed like a well-to-do cattle
dealer, and she came forward making a great outcry and exclaiming, “Justice,
señor governor, justice! and if I don’t get it on earth I’ll
go look for it in heaven. Señor governor of my soul, this wicked man
caught me in the middle of the fields here and used my body as if it was
an ill-washed rag, and, woe is me! got from me what I had kept these
three-and-twenty years and more, defending it against Moors and
Christians, natives and strangers; and I always as hard as an oak, and
keeping myself as pure as a salamander in the fire, or wool among the
brambles, for this good fellow to come now with clean hands to handle me!”
</p>
<p>
“It remains to be proved whether this gallant has clean hands or
not,” said Sancho; and turning to the man he asked him what he had
to say in answer to the woman’s charge.
</p>
<p>
He all in confusion made answer, “Sirs, I am a poor pig dealer, and
this morning I left the village to sell (saving your presence) four pigs,
and between dues and cribbings they got out of me little less than the
worth of them. As I was returning to my village I fell in on the road with
this good dame, and the devil who makes a coil and a mess out of
everything, yoked us together. I paid her fairly, but she not contented
laid hold of me and never let go until she brought me here; she says I
forced her, but she lies by the oath I swear or am ready to swear; and
this is the whole truth and every particle of it.”
</p>
<p>
The governor on this asked him if he had any money in silver about him; he
said he had about twenty ducats in a leather purse in his bosom. The
governor bade him take it out and hand it to the complainant; he obeyed
trembling; the woman took it, and making a thousand salaams to all and
praying to God for the long life and health of the señor governor who had
such regard for distressed orphans and virgins, she hurried out of court
with the purse grasped in both her hands, first looking, however, to see
if the money it contained was silver.
</p>
<p>
As soon as she was gone Sancho said to the cattle dealer, whose tears were
already starting and whose eyes and heart were following his purse,
“Good fellow, go after that woman and take the purse from her, by
force even, and come back with it here;” and he did not say it to
one who was a fool or deaf, for the man was off like a flash of lightning,
and ran to do as he was bid.
</p>
<p>
All the bystanders waited anxiously to see the end of the case, and
presently both man and woman came back at even closer grips than before,
she with her petticoat up and the purse in the lap of it, and he
struggling hard to take it from her, but all to no purpose, so stout was
the woman’s defence, she all the while crying out, “Justice
from God and the world! see here, señor governor, the shamelessness and
boldness of this villain, who in the middle of the town, in the middle of
the street, wanted to take from me the purse your worship bade him give
me.”
</p>
<p>
“And did he take it?” asked the governor.
</p>
<p>
“Take it!” said the woman; “I’d let my life be
taken from me sooner than the purse. A pretty child I’d be! It’s
another sort of cat they must throw in my face, and not that poor scurvy
knave. Pincers and hammers, mallets and chisels would not get it out of my
grip; no, nor lions’ claws; the soul from out of my body first!”
</p>
<p>
“She is right,” said the man; “I own myself beaten and
powerless; I confess I haven’t the strength to take it from her;”
and he let go his hold of her.
</p>
<p>
Upon this the governor said to the woman, “Let me see that purse, my
worthy and sturdy friend.” She handed it to him at once, and the
governor returned it to the man, and said to the unforced mistress of
force, “Sister, if you had shown as much, or only half as much,
spirit and vigour in defending your body as you have shown in defending
that purse, the strength of Hercules could not have forced you. Be off,
and God speed you, and bad luck to you, and don’t show your face in
all this island, or within six leagues of it on any side, under pain of
two hundred lashes; be off at once, I say, you shameless, cheating shrew.”
</p>
<p>
The woman was cowed and went off disconsolately, hanging her head; and the
governor said to the man, “Honest man, go home with your money, and
God speed you; and for the future, if you don’t want to lose it, see
that you don’t take it into your head to yoke with anybody.”
The man thanked him as clumsily as he could and went his way, and the
bystanders were again filled with admiration at their new governor’s
judgments and sentences.
</p>
<p>
Next, two men, one apparently a farm labourer, and the other a tailor, for
he had a pair of shears in his hand, presented themselves before him, and
the tailor said, “Señor governor, this labourer and I come before
your worship by reason of this honest man coming to my shop yesterday (for
saving everybody’s presence I’m a passed tailor, God be
thanked), and putting a piece of cloth into my hands and asking me,
‘Señor, will there be enough in this cloth to make me a cap?’
Measuring the cloth I said there would. He probably suspected—as I
supposed, and I supposed right—that I wanted to steal some of the
cloth, led to think so by his own roguery and the bad opinion people have
of tailors; and he told me to see if there would be enough for two. I
guessed what he would be at, and I said ‘yes.’ He, still
following up his original unworthy notion, went on adding cap after cap,
and I ‘yes’ after ‘yes,’ until we got as far as
five. He has just this moment come for them; I gave them to him, but he
won’t pay me for the making; on the contrary, he calls upon me to
pay him, or else return his cloth.”
</p>
<p>
“Is all this true, brother?” said Sancho.
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” replied the man; “but will your worship make him
show the five caps he has made me?”
</p>
<p>
“With all my heart,” said the tailor; and drawing his hand
from under his cloak he showed five caps stuck upon the five fingers of
it, and said, “there are the caps this good man asks for; and by God
and upon my conscience I haven’t a scrap of cloth left, and I’ll
let the work be examined by the inspectors of the trade.”
</p>
<p>
All present laughed at the number of caps and the novelty of the suit;
Sancho set himself to think for a moment, and then said, “It seems
to me that in this case it is not necessary to deliver long-winded
arguments, but only to give off-hand the judgment of an honest man; and so
my decision is that the tailor lose the making and the labourer the cloth,
and that the caps go to the prisoners in the gaol, and let there be no
more about it.”
</p>
<p>
If the previous decision about the cattle dealer’s purse excited the
admiration of the bystanders, this provoked their laughter; however, the
governor’s orders were after all executed. All this, having been
taken down by his chronicler, was at once despatched to the duke, who was
looking out for it with great eagerness; and here let us leave the good
Sancho; for his master, sorely troubled in mind by Altisidora’s
music, has pressing claims upon us now.

We left Don Quixote wrapped up in the reflections which the music of the
enamourned maid Altisidora had given rise to. He went to bed with them,
and just like fleas they would not let him sleep or get a moment’s
rest, and the broken stitches of his stockings helped them. But as Time is
fleet and no obstacle can stay his course, he came riding on the hours,
and morning very soon arrived. Seeing which Don Quixote quitted the soft
down, and, nowise slothful, dressed himself in his chamois suit and put on
his travelling boots to hide the disaster to his stockings. He threw over
him his scarlet mantle, put on his head a montera of green velvet trimmed
with silver edging, flung across his shoulder the baldric with his good
trenchant sword, took up a large rosary that he always carried with him,
and with great solemnity and precision of gait proceeded to the
antechamber where the duke and duchess were already dressed and waiting
for him. But as he passed through a gallery, Altisidora and the other
damsel, her friend, were lying in wait for him, and the instant Altisidora
saw him she pretended to faint, while her friend caught her in her lap,
and began hastily unlacing the bosom of her dress.
</p>
<p>
Don Quixote observed it, and approaching them said, “I know very
well what this seizure arises from.”
</p>
<p>
“I know not from what,” replied the friend, “for
Altisidora is the healthiest damsel in all this house, and I have never
heard her complain all the time I have known her. A plague on all the
knights-errant in the world, if they be all ungrateful! Go away, Señor Don
Quixote; for this poor child will not come to herself again so long as you
are here.”

</p>
<p>
To which Don Quixote returned, “Do me the favour, señora, to let a
lute be placed in my chamber to-night; and I will comfort this poor maiden
to the best of my power; for in the early stages of love a prompt
disillusion is an approved remedy;” and with this he retired, so as
not to be remarked by any who might see him there.
</p>
<p>
He had scarcely withdrawn when Altisidora, recovering from her swoon, said
to her companion, “The lute must be left, for no doubt Don Quixote
intends to give us some music; and being his it will not be bad.”
</p>
<p>
They went at once to inform the duchess of what was going on, and of the
lute Don Quixote asked for, and she, delighted beyond measure, plotted
with the duke and her two damsels to play him a trick that should be
amusing but harmless; and in high glee they waited for night, which came
quickly as the day had come; and as for the day, the duke and duchess
spent it in charming conversation with Don Quixote.
</p>
<p>
When eleven o’clock came, Don Quixote found a guitar in his chamber;
he tried it, opened the window, and perceived that some persons were
walking in the garden; and having passed his fingers over the frets of the
guitar and tuned it as well as he could, he spat and cleared his chest,
and then with a voice a little hoarse but full-toned, he sang the
following ballad, which he had himself that day composed:
</p>
<p class="poem">
Mighty Love the hearts of maidens<br>
Doth unsettle and perplex,<br>
And the instrument he uses<br>
Most of all is idleness.<br>
<br>
Sewing, stitching, any labour,<br>
Having always work to do,<br>
To the poison Love instilleth<br>
Is the antidote most sure.<br>
<br>
And to proper-minded maidens<br>
Who desire the matron’s name<br>
Modesty’s a marriage portion,<br>
Modesty their highest praise.<br>
<br>
Men of prudence and discretion,<br>
Courtiers gay and gallant knights,<br>
With the wanton damsels dally,<br>
But the modest take to wife.<br>
There are passions, transient, fleeting,<br>
Loves in hostelries declar’d,<br>
Sunrise loves, with sunset ended,<br>
When the guest hath gone his way.<br>
<br>
Love that springs up swift and sudden,<br>
Here to-day, to-morrow flown,<br>
Passes, leaves no trace behind it,<br>
Leaves no image on the soul.<br>
<br>
Painting that is laid on painting<br>
Maketh no display or show;<br>
Where one beauty’s in possession<br>
There no other can take hold.<br>
<br>
Dulcinea del Toboso<br>
Painted on my heart I wear;<br>
Never from its tablets, never,<br>
Can her image be eras’d.<br>
<br>
The quality of all in lovers<br>
Most esteemed is constancy;<br>
’Tis by this that love works wonders,<br>
This exalts them to the skies.<br>
</p>
<p>
Don Quixote had got so far with his song, to which the duke, the duchess,
Altisidora, and nearly the whole household of the castle were listening,
when all of a sudden from a gallery above that was exactly over his window
they let down a cord with more than a hundred bells attached to it, and
immediately after that discharged a great sack full of cats, which also
had bells of smaller size tied to their tails. Such was the din of the
bells and the squalling of the cats, that though the duke and duchess were
the contrivers of the joke they were startled by it, while Don Quixote
stood paralysed with fear; and as luck would have it, two or three of the
cats made their way in through the grating of his chamber, and flying from
one side to the other, made it seem as if there was a legion of devils at
large in it. They extinguished the candles that were burning in the room,
and rushed about seeking some way of escape; the cord with the large bells
never ceased rising and falling; and most of the people of the castle, not
knowing what was really the matter, were at their wits’ end with
astonishment. Don Quixote sprang to his feet, and drawing his sword, began
making passes at the grating, shouting out, “Avaunt, malignant
enchanters! avaunt, ye witchcraft-working rabble! I am Don Quixote of La
Mancha, against whom your evil machinations avail not nor have any power.”
And turning upon the cats that were running about the room, he made
several cuts at them. They dashed at the grating and escaped by it, save
one that, finding itself hard pressed by the slashes of Don Quixote’s
sword, flew at his face and held on to his nose tooth and nail, with the
pain of which he began to shout his loudest. The duke and duchess hearing
this, and guessing what it was, ran with all haste to his room, and as the
poor gentleman was striving with all his might to detach the cat from his
face, they opened the door with a master-key and went in with lights and
witnessed the unequal combat. The duke ran forward to part the combatants,
but Don Quixote cried out aloud, “Let no one take him from me; leave
me hand to hand with this demon, this wizard, this enchanter; I will teach
him, I myself, who Don Quixote of La Mancha is.” The cat, however,
never minding these threats, snarled and held on; but at last the duke
pulled it off and flung it out of the window. Don Quixote was left with a
face as full of holes as a sieve and a nose not in very good condition,
and greatly vexed that they did not let him finish the battle he had been
so stoutly fighting with that villain of an enchanter. They sent for some
oil of John’s wort, and Altisidora herself with her own fair hands
bandaged all the wounded parts; and as she did so she said to him in a low
voice. “All these mishaps have befallen thee, hardhearted knight,
for the sin of thy insensibility and obstinacy; and God grant thy squire
Sancho may forget to whip himself, so that that dearly beloved Dulcinea of
thine may never be released from her enchantment, that thou mayest never
come to her bed, at least while I who adore thee am alive.”
</p>
<p>
To all this Don Quixote made no answer except to heave deep sighs, and
then stretched himself on his bed, thanking the duke and duchess for their
kindness, not because he stood in any fear of that bell-ringing rabble of
enchanters in cat shape, but because he recognised their good intentions
in coming to his rescue. The duke and duchess left him to repose and
withdrew greatly grieved at the unfortunate result of the joke; as they
never thought the adventure would have fallen so heavy on Don Quixote or
cost him so dear, for it cost him five days of confinement to his bed,
during which he had another adventure, pleasanter than the late one, which
his chronicler will not relate just now in order that he may turn his
attention to Sancho Panza, who was proceeding with great diligence and
drollery in his government.

<p>
The history says that from the justice court they carried Sancho to a
sumptuous palace, where in a spacious chamber there was a table laid out
with royal magnificence. The clarions sounded as Sancho entered the room,
and four pages came forward to present him with water for his hands, which
Sancho received with great dignity. The music ceased, and Sancho seated
himself at the head of the table, for there was only that seat placed, and
no more than one cover laid. A personage, who it appeared afterwards was a
physician, placed himself standing by his side with a whalebone wand in
his hand. They then lifted up a fine white cloth covering fruit and a
great variety of dishes of different sorts; one who looked like a student
said grace, and a page put a laced bib on Sancho, while another who played
the part of head carver placed a dish of fruit before him. But hardly had
he tasted a morsel when the man with the wand touched the plate with it,
and they took it away from before him with the utmost celerity. The
carver, however, brought him another dish, and Sancho proceeded to try it;
but before he could get at it, not to say taste it, already the wand had
touched it and a page had carried it off with the same promptitude as the
fruit. Sancho seeing this was puzzled, and looking from one to another
asked if this dinner was to be eaten after the fashion of a jugglery
trick.
</p>
<p>
To this he with the wand replied, “It is not to be eaten, señor
governor, except as is usual and customary in other islands where there
are governors. I, señor, am a physician, and I am paid a salary in this
island to serve its governors as such, and I have a much greater regard
for their health than for my own, studying day and night and making myself
acquainted with the governor’s constitution, in order to be able to
cure him when he falls sick. The chief thing I have to do is to attend at
his dinners and suppers and allow him to eat what appears to me to be fit
for him, and keep from him what I think will do him harm and be injurious
to his stomach; and therefore I ordered that plate of fruit to be removed
as being too moist, and that other dish I ordered to be removed as being
too hot and containing many spices that stimulate thirst; for he who
drinks much kills and consumes the radical moisture wherein life consists.”
</p>
<p>
“Well then,” said Sancho, “that dish of roast partridges
there that seems so savoury will not do me any harm.”
</p>
<p>
To this the physician replied, “Of those my lord the governor shall
not eat so long as I live.”
</p>
<p>
“Why so?” said Sancho.
</p>
<p>
“Because,” replied the doctor, “our master Hippocrates,
the polestar and beacon of medicine, says in one of his aphorisms <i>omnis
saturatio mala, perdicis autem pessima</i>, which means ‘all repletion
is bad, but that of partridge is the worst of all.”
</p>
<p>
“In that case,” said Sancho, “let señor doctor see among
the dishes that are on the table what will do me most good and least harm,
and let me eat it, without tapping it with his stick; for by the life of
the governor, and so may God suffer me to enjoy it, but I’m dying of
hunger; and in spite of the doctor and all he may say, to deny me food is
the way to take my life instead of prolonging it.”

“Your worship is right, señor governor,” said the physician;
“and therefore your worship, I consider, should not eat of those
stewed rabbits there, because it is a furry kind of food; if that veal
were not roasted and served with pickles, you might try it; but it is out
of the question.”

“That big dish that is smoking farther off,” said Sancho,
“seems to me to be an olla podrida, and out of the diversity of
things in such ollas, I can’t fail to light upon something tasty and
good for me.”

“<i>Absit</i>,” said the doctor; “far from us be any such
base thought! There is nothing in the world less nourishing than an olla
podrida; to canons, or rectors of colleges, or peasants’ weddings with
your ollas podridas, but let us have none of them on the tables of governors,
where everything that is present should be delicate and refined; and the reason
is, that always, everywhere and by everybody, simple medicines are more
esteemed than compound ones, for we cannot go wrong in those that are simple,
while in the compound we may, by merely altering the quantity of the things
composing them. But what I am of opinion the governor should eat now in order
to preserve and fortify his health is a hundred or so of wafer cakes and a few
thin slices of conserve of quinces, which will settle his stomach and help his
digestion.”

Sancho on hearing this threw himself back in his chair and surveyed the
doctor steadily, and in a solemn tone asked him what his name was and
where he had studied.

He replied, “My name, señor governor, is Doctor Pedro Recio de
Aguero I am a native of a place called Tirteafuera which lies between
Caracuel and Almodóvar del Campo, on the right-hand side, and I have the
degree of doctor from the university of Osuna.”

To which Sancho, glowing all over with rage, returned, “Then let
Doctor Pedro Recio de Malaguero, native of Tirteafuera, a place that’s
on the right-hand side as we go from Caracuel to Almodóvar del Campo,
