daughter,” said Ricote; “but as I felt sure of my Ricota’s
virtue it gave me no uneasiness to know that he loved her; for thou must
have heard it said, Sancho, that the Morisco women seldom or never engage
in amours with the old Christians; and my daughter, who I fancy thought
more of being a Christian than of lovemaking, would not trouble herself
about the attentions of this heir.”
</p>
<p>
repaid thy faithful services! Forgive me, and entreat Fortune, as well as thou
“God grant it,” said Sancho, “for it would be a bad
business for both of them; but now let me be off, friend Ricote, for I
want to reach where my master Don Quixote is to-night.”
</p>
<p>
“God be with thee, brother Sancho,” said Ricote; “my
comrades are beginning to stir, and it is time, too, for us to continue
our journey;” and then they both embraced, and Sancho mounted
Dapple, and Ricote leant upon his staff, and so they parted.

The length of time he delayed with Ricote prevented Sancho from reaching the
duke’s castle that day, though he was within half a league of it when
night, somewhat dark and cloudy, overtook him. This, however, as it was summer
time, did not give him much uneasiness, and he turned aside out of the road
intending to wait for morning; but his ill luck and hard fate so willed it that
as he was searching about for a place to make himself as comfortable as
possible, he and Dapple fell into a deep dark hole that lay among some very old
buildings. As he fell he commended himself with all his heart to God, fancying
he was not going to stop until he reached the depths of the bottomless pit; but
it did not turn out so, for at little more than thrice a man’s height
Dapple touched bottom, and he found himself sitting on him without having
received any hurt or damage whatever. He felt himself all over and held his
breath to try whether he was quite sound or had a hole made in him anywhere,
and finding himself all right and whole and in perfect health he was profuse in
his thanks to God our Lord for the mercy that had been shown him, for he made
sure he had been broken into a thousand pieces. He also felt along the sides of
the pit with his hands to see if it were possible to get out of it without
help, but he found they were quite smooth and afforded no hold anywhere, at
which he was greatly distressed, especially when he heard how pathetically and
dolefully Dapple was bemoaning himself, and no wonder he complained, nor was it
from ill-temper, for in truth he was not in a very good case.
“Alas,” said Sancho, “what unexpected accidents happen at
every step to those who live in this miserable world! Who would have said that
one who saw himself yesterday sitting on a throne, governor of an island,
giving orders to his servants and his vassals, would see himself to-day buried
in a pit without a soul to help him, or servant or vassal to come to his
relief? Here must we perish with hunger, my ass and myself, if indeed we
don’t die first, he of his bruises and injuries, and I of grief and
sorrow. At any rate I’ll not be as lucky as my master Don Quixote of La
Mancha, when he went down into the cave of that enchanted Montesinos, where he
found people to make more of him than if he had been in his own house; for it
seems he came in for a table laid out and a bed ready made. There he saw fair
and pleasant visions, but here I’ll see, I imagine, toads and adders.
Unlucky wretch that I am, what an end my follies and fancies have come to!
They’ll take up my bones out of this, when it is heaven’s will that
I’m found, picked clean, white and polished, and my good Dapple’s
with them, and by that, perhaps, it will be found out who we are, at least by
such as have heard that Sancho Panza never separated from his ass, nor his ass
from Sancho Panza. Unlucky wretches, I say again, that our hard fate should not
let us die in our own country and among our own people, where if there was no
help for our misfortune, at any rate there would be someone to grieve for it
and to close our eyes as we passed away! O comrade and friend, how ill have I
repaid thy faithful services! Forgive me, and entreat Fortune, as well as thou
canst, to deliver us out of this miserable strait we are both in; and I promise
to put a crown of laurel on thy head, and make thee look like a poet laureate,
and give thee double feeds.”
</p>
<p>
<br><br><br><br> <a id="p55b"></a>
</p>
<div class="fig" style="width:60%;">
<img alt="p55b.jpg (273K)" src="images/p55b.jpg" style="width:100%;" id="id-7680666341622822779">

</p>
<p>
In this strain did Sancho bewail himself, and his ass listened to him, but
answered him never a word, such was the distress and anguish the poor
beast found himself in. At length, after a night spent in bitter moanings
and lamentations, day came, and by its light Sancho perceived that it was
wholly impossible to escape out of that pit without help, and he fell to
bemoaning his fate and uttering loud shouts to find out if there was
anyone within hearing; but all his shouting was only crying in the
wilderness, for there was not a soul anywhere in the neighbourhood to hear
him, and then at last he gave himself up for dead. Dapple was lying on his
back, and Sancho helped him to his feet, which he was scarcely able to
keep; and then taking a piece of bread out of his alforjas which had
shared their fortunes in the fall, he gave it to the ass, to whom it was
not unwelcome, saying to him as if he understood him, “With bread
all sorrows are less.”
</p>
<p>
And now he perceived on one side of the pit a hole large enough to admit a
person if he stooped and squeezed himself into a small compass. Sancho
made for it, and entered it by creeping, and found it wide and spacious on
the inside, which he was able to see as a ray of sunlight that penetrated
what might be called the roof showed it all plainly. He observed too that
it opened and widened out into another spacious cavity; seeing which he
made his way back to where the ass was, and with a stone began to pick
away the clay from the hole until in a short time he had made room for the
beast to pass easily, and this accomplished, taking him by the halter, he
proceeded to traverse the cavern to see if there was any outlet at the
other end. He advanced, sometimes in the dark, sometimes without light,
but never without fear; “God Almighty help me!” said he to
himself; “this that is a misadventure to me would make a good
adventure for my master Don Quixote. He would have been sure to take these
depths and dungeons for flowery gardens or the palaces of Galiana, and
would have counted upon issuing out of this darkness and imprisonment into
some blooming meadow; but I, unlucky that I am, hopeless and spiritless,
expect at every step another pit deeper than the first to open under my
feet and swallow me up for good; ‘welcome evil, if thou comest
alone.’”
</p>
<p>
In this way and with these reflections he seemed to himself to have
travelled rather more than half a league, when at last he perceived a dim
light that looked like daylight and found its way in on one side, showing
that this road, which appeared to him the road to the other world, led to
some opening.
</p>
<p>
Here Cide Hamete leaves him, and returns to Don Quixote, who in high
spirits and satisfaction was looking forward to the day fixed for the
battle he was to fight with him who had robbed Doña Rodriguez’s
daughter of her honour, for whom he hoped to obtain satisfaction for the
wrong and injury shamefully done to her. It came to pass, then, that
having sallied forth one morning to practise and exercise himself in what
he would have to do in the encounter he expected to find himself engaged
in the next day, as he was putting Rocinante through his paces or pressing
him to the charge, he brought his feet so close to a pit that but for
reining him in tightly it would have been impossible for him to avoid
falling into it. He pulled him up, however, without a fall, and coming a
little closer examined the hole without dismounting; but as he was looking
at it he heard loud cries proceeding from it, and by listening attentively
was able to make out that he who uttered them was saying, “Ho, above
there! is there any Christian that hears me, or any charitable gentleman
that will take pity on a sinner buried alive, on an unfortunate
disgoverned governor?”
</p>
<p>
It struck Don Quixote that it was the voice of Sancho Panza he heard,
whereat he was taken aback and amazed, and raising his own voice as much
as he could, he cried out, “Who is below there? Who is that
complaining?”
</p>
<p>
“Who should be here, or who should complain,” was the answer,
“but the forlorn Sancho Panza, for his sins and for his ill-luck
governor of the island of Barataria, squire that was to the famous knight
Don Quixote of La Mancha?”
</p>
<p>
When Don Quixote heard this his amazement was redoubled and his
perturbation grew greater than ever, for it suggested itself to his mind
that Sancho must be dead, and that his soul was in torment down there; and
carried away by this idea he exclaimed, “I conjure thee by
everything that as a Catholic Christian I can conjure thee by, tell me who
thou art; and if thou art a soul in torment, tell me what thou wouldst
have me do for thee; for as my profession is to give aid and succour to
those that need it in this world, it will also extend to aiding and
succouring the distressed of the other, who cannot help themselves.”
</p>
<p>
“In that case,” answered the voice, “your worship who
speaks to me must be my master Don Quixote of La Mancha; nay, from the
tone of the voice it is plain it can be nobody else.”
</p>
<p>
“Don Quixote I am,” replied Don Quixote, “he whose
profession it is to aid and succour the living and the dead in their
necessities; wherefore tell me who thou art, for thou art keeping me in
suspense; because, if thou art my squire Sancho Panza, and art dead, since
the devils have not carried thee off, and thou art by God’s mercy in
purgatory, our holy mother the Roman Catholic Church has intercessory
means sufficient to release thee from the pains thou art in; and I for my
part will plead with her to that end, so far as my substance will go;
without further delay, therefore, declare thyself, and tell me who thou
art.”
</p>
<p>
“By all that’s good,” was the answer, “and by the
birth of whomsoever your worship chooses, I swear, Señor Don Quixote of La
Mancha, that I am your squire Sancho Panza, and that I have never died all
my life; but that, having given up my government for reasons that would
require more time to explain, I fell last night into this pit where I am
now, and Dapple is witness and won’t let me lie, for more by token
he is here with me.”
</p>
<p>
Nor was this all; one would have fancied the ass understood what Sancho
said, because that moment he began to bray so loudly that the whole cave
rang again.
</p>
<p>
“Famous testimony!” exclaimed Don Quixote; “I know that
bray as well as if I was its mother, and thy voice too, my Sancho. Wait
while I go to the duke’s castle, which is close by, and I will bring
someone to take thee out of this pit into which thy sins no doubt have
brought thee.”
</p>
<p>
“Go, your worship,” said Sancho, “and come back quick
for God’s sake; for I cannot bear being buried alive any longer, and
I’m dying of fear.”
</p>
<p>
Don Quixote left him, and hastened to the castle to tell the duke and
duchess what had happened Sancho, and they were not a little astonished at
it; they could easily understand his having fallen, from the confirmatory
circumstance of the cave which had been in existence there from time
immemorial; but they could not imagine how he had quitted the government
without their receiving any intimation of his coming. To be brief, they
fetched ropes and tackle, as the saying is, and by dint of many hands and
much labour they drew up Dapple and Sancho Panza out of the darkness into
the light of day. A student who saw him remarked, “That’s the
way all bad governors should come out of their governments, as this sinner
comes out of the depths of the pit, dead with hunger, pale, and I suppose
without a farthing.”
</p>
<p>
Sancho overheard him and said, “It is eight or ten days, brother
growler, since I entered upon the government of the island they gave me,
and all that time I never had a bellyful of victuals, no not for an hour;
doctors persecuted me and enemies crushed my bones; nor had I any
opportunity of taking bribes or levying taxes; and if that be the case, as
it is, I don’t deserve, I think, to come out in this fashion; but
‘man proposes and God disposes;’ and God knows what is best,
and what suits each one best; and ‘as the occasion, so the
behaviour;’ and ‘let nobody say “I won’t drink of
this water;”’ and ‘where one thinks there are flitches,
there are no pegs;’ God knows my meaning and that’s enough; I
say no more, though I could.”
</p>
<p>
“Be not angry or annoyed at what thou hearest, Sancho,” said
Don Quixote, “or there will never be an end of it; keep a safe
conscience and let them say what they like; for trying to stop slanderers’
tongues is like trying to put gates to the open plain. If a governor comes
out of his government rich, they say he has been a thief; and if he comes
out poor, that he has been a noodle and a blockhead.”
</p>
<p>
“They’ll be pretty sure this time,” said Sancho, “to
set me down for a fool rather than a thief.”
</p>
<p>
Thus talking, and surrounded by boys and a crowd of people, they reached
the castle, where in one of the corridors the duke and duchess stood
waiting for them; but Sancho would not go up to see the duke until he had
first put up Dapple in the stable, for he said he had passed a very bad
night in his last quarters; then he went upstairs to see his lord and
lady, and kneeling before them he said, “Because it was your
highnesses’ pleasure, not because of any desert of my own, I went to
govern your island of Barataria, which ‘I entered naked, and naked I
find myself; I neither lose nor gain.’ Whether I have governed well
or ill, I have had witnesses who will say what they think fit. I have
answered questions, I have decided causes, and always dying of hunger, for
Doctor Pedro Recio of Tirteafuera, the island and governor doctor, would
have it so. Enemies attacked us by night and put us in a great quandary,
but the people of the island say they came off safe and victorious by the
might of my arm; and may God give them as much health as there’s
truth in what they say. In short, during that time I have weighed the
cares and responsibilities governing brings with it, and by my reckoning I
find my shoulders can’t bear them, nor are they a load for my loins
or arrows for my quiver; and so, before the government threw me over I
preferred to throw the government over; and yesterday morning I left the
island as I found it, with the same streets, houses, and roofs it had when
I entered it. I asked no loan of anybody, nor did I try to fill my pocket;
and though I meant to make some useful laws, I made hardly any, as I was
afraid they would not be kept; for in that case it comes to the same thing
to make them or not to make them. I quitted the island, as I said, without
any escort except my ass; I fell into a pit, I pushed on through it, until
this morning by the light of the sun I saw an outlet, but not so easy a
one but that, had not heaven sent me my master Don Quixote, I’d have
stayed there till the end of the world. So now my lord and lady duke and
duchess, here is your governor Sancho Panza, who in the bare ten days he
has held the government has come by the knowledge that he would not give
anything to be governor, not to say of an island, but of the whole world;
and that point being settled, kissing your worships’ feet, and
imitating the game of the boys when they say, ‘leap thou, and give
me one,’ I take a leap out of the government and pass into the
service of my master Don Quixote; for after all, though in it I eat my
bread in fear and trembling, at any rate I take my fill; and for my part,
so long as I’m full, it’s all alike to me whether it’s
with carrots or with partridges.”
</p>
<p>
Here Sancho brought his long speech to an end, Don Quixote having been the
whole time in dread of his uttering a host of absurdities; and when he
found him leave off with so few, he thanked heaven in his heart. The duke
embraced Sancho and told him he was heartily sorry he had given up the
government so soon, but that he would see that he was provided with some
other post on his estate less onerous and more profitable. The duchess
also embraced him, and gave orders that he should be taken good care of,
as it was plain to see he had been badly treated and worse bruised.

OF THE PRODIGIOUS AND UNPARALLELED BATTLE THAT TOOK PLACE BETWEEN DON

</p>
<p>
The duke and duchess had no reason to regret the joke that had been played
upon Sancho Panza in giving him the government; especially as their
majordomo returned the same day, and gave them a minute account of almost
every word and deed that Sancho uttered or did during the time; and to
wind up with, eloquently described to them the attack upon the island and
Sancho’s fright and departure, with which they were not a little
amused. After this the history goes on to say that the day fixed for the
battle arrived, and that the duke, after having repeatedly instructed his
lacquey Tosilos how to deal with Don Quixote so as to vanquish him without
killing or wounding him, gave orders to have the heads removed from the
lances, telling Don Quixote that Christian charity, on which he plumed
himself, could not suffer the battle to be fought with so much risk and
danger to life; and that he must be content with the offer of a
battlefield on his territory (though that was against the decree of the
holy Council, which prohibits all challenges of the sort) and not push
such an arduous venture to its extreme limits. Don Quixote bade his
excellence arrange all matters connected with the affair as he pleased, as
on his part he would obey him in everything. The dread day, then, having
arrived, and the duke having ordered a spacious stand to be erected facing
the court of the castle for the judges of the field and the appellant
duennas, mother and daughter, vast crowds flocked from all the villages
and hamlets of the neighbourhood to see the novel spectacle of the battle;
nobody, dead or alive, in those parts having ever seen or heard of such a
one.
</p>
<p>
The first person to enter the field and the lists was the master of the
ceremonies, who surveyed and paced the whole ground to see that there was
nothing unfair and nothing concealed to make the combatants stumble or
fall; then the duennas entered and seated themselves, enveloped in mantles
covering their eyes, nay even their bosoms, and displaying no slight
emotion as Don Quixote appeared in the lists. Shortly afterwards,
accompanied by several trumpets and mounted on a powerful steed that
threatened to crush the whole place, the great lacquey Tosilos made his
appearance on one side of the courtyard with his visor down and stiffly
cased in a suit of stout shining armour. The horse was a manifest
Frieslander, broad-backed and flea-bitten, and with half a hundred of wool
hanging to each of his fetlocks. The gallant combatant came well primed by
his master the duke as to how he was to bear himself against the valiant
Don Quixote of La Mancha; being warned that he must on no account slay
him, but strive to shirk the first encounter so as to avoid the risk of
killing him, as he was sure to do if he met him full tilt. He crossed the
courtyard at a walk, and coming to where the duennas were placed stopped
to look at her who demanded him for a husband; the marshal of the field
summoned Don Quixote, who had already presented himself in the courtyard,
and standing by the side of Tosilos he addressed the duennas, and asked
them if they consented that Don Quixote of La Mancha should do battle for
their right. They said they did, and that whatever he should do in that
behalf they declared rightly done, final and valid. By this time the duke
and duchess had taken their places in a gallery commanding the enclosure,
which was filled to overflowing with a multitude of people eager to see
this perilous and unparalleled encounter. The conditions of the combat
were that if Don Quixote proved the victor his antagonist was to marry the
daughter of Doña Rodriguez; but if he should be vanquished his opponent
was released from the promise that was claimed against him and from all
obligations to give satisfaction. The master of the ceremonies apportioned
the sun to them, and stationed them, each on the spot where he was to
stand. The drums beat, the sound of the trumpets filled the air, the earth
trembled under foot, the hearts of the gazing crowd were full of anxiety,
some hoping for a happy issue, some apprehensive of an untoward ending to
the affair, and lastly, Don Quixote, commending himself with all his heart
to God our Lord and to the lady Dulcinea del Toboso, stood waiting for
them to give the necessary signal for the onset. Our lacquey, however, was
thinking of something very different; he only thought of what I am now
going to mention.
</p>
<p>
It seems that as he stood contemplating his enemy she struck him as the
most beautiful woman he had ever seen all his life; and the little blind
boy whom in our streets they commonly call Love had no mind to let slip
the chance of triumphing over a lacquey heart, and adding it to the list
of his trophies; and so, stealing gently upon him unseen, he drove a dart
two yards long into the poor lacquey’s left side and pierced his
heart through and through; which he was able to do quite at his ease, for
Love is invisible, and comes in and goes out as he likes, without anyone
calling him to account for what he does. Well then, when they gave the
signal for the onset our lacquey was in an ecstasy, musing upon the beauty
of her whom he had already made mistress of his liberty, and so he paid no
attention to the sound of the trumpet, unlike Don Quixote, who was off the
instant he heard it, and, at the highest speed Rocinante was capable of,
set out to meet his enemy, his good squire Sancho shouting lustily as he
saw him start, “God guide thee, cream and flower of knights-errant!
God give thee the victory, for thou hast the right on thy side!” But
though Tosilos saw Don Quixote coming at him he never stirred a step from
the spot where he was posted; and instead of doing so called loudly to the
marshal of the field, to whom when he came up to see what he wanted he
said, “Señor, is not this battle to decide whether I marry or do not
marry that lady?” “Just so,” was the answer. “Well
then,” said the lacquey, “I feel qualms of conscience, and I
should lay a heavy burden upon it if I were to proceed any further with
the combat; I therefore declare that I yield myself vanquished, and that I
am willing to marry the lady at once.”
</p>
<p>
The marshal of the field was lost in astonishment at the words of Tosilos;
and as he was one of those who were privy to the arrangement of the affair
he knew not what to say in reply. Don Quixote pulled up in mid career when
he saw that his enemy was not coming on to the attack. The duke could not
make out the reason why the battle did not go on; but the marshal of the
field hastened to him to let him know what Tosilos said, and he was amazed
and extremely angry at it. In the meantime Tosilos advanced to where Doña
Rodriguez sat and said in a loud voice, “Señora, I am willing to
marry your daughter, and I have no wish to obtain by strife and fighting
what I can obtain in peace and without any risk to my life.”
</p>
<p>
The valiant Don Quixote heard him, and said, “As that is the case I
am released and absolved from my promise; let them marry by all means, and
as ‘God our Lord has given her, may Saint Peter add his blessing.’”
</p>
<p>
The duke had now descended to the courtyard of the castle, and going up to
Tosilos he said to him, “Is it true, sir knight, that you yield
yourself vanquished, and that moved by scruples of conscience you wish to
marry this damsel?”
</p>
<p>
“It is, señor,” replied Tosilos.
</p>
<p>
“And he does well,” said Sancho, “for what thou hast to
give to the mouse, give to the cat, and it will save thee all trouble.”
</p>
<p>
Tosilos meanwhile was trying to unlace his helmet, and he begged them to
come to his help at once, as his power of breathing was failing him, and
he could not remain so long shut up in that confined space. They removed
it in all haste, and his lacquey features were revealed to public gaze. At
this sight Doña Rodriguez and her daughter raised a mighty outcry,
exclaiming, “This is a trick! This is a trick! They have put
Tosilos, my lord the duke’s lacquey, upon us in place of the real
husband. The justice of God and the king against such trickery, not to say
roguery!”
</p>
<p>
“Do not distress yourselves, ladies,” said Don Quixote;
“for this is no trickery or roguery; or if it is, it is not the duke
who is at the bottom of it, but those wicked enchanters who persecute me,
and who, jealous of my reaping the glory of this victory, have turned your
husband’s features into those of this person, who you say is a
lacquey of the duke’s; take my advice, and notwithstanding the
malice of my enemies marry him, for beyond a doubt he is the one you wish
for a husband.”
</div>
</p>
<p>
When the duke heard this all his anger was near vanishing in a fit of
laughter, and he said, “The things that happen to Señor Don Quixote
are so extraordinary that I am ready to believe this lacquey of mine is
not one; but let us adopt this plan and device; let us put off the
marriage for, say, a fortnight, and let us keep this person about whom we
are uncertain in close confinement, and perhaps in the course of that time
he may return to his original shape; for the spite which the enchanters
entertain against Señor Don Quixote cannot last so long, especially as it
is of so little advantage to them to practise these deceptions and
transformations.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, señor,” said Sancho, “those scoundrels are well
used to changing whatever concerns my master from one thing into another.
A knight that he overcame some time back, called the Knight of the
Mirrors, they turned into the shape of the bachelor Samson Carrasco of our
town and a great friend of ours; and my lady Dulcinea del Toboso they have
turned into a common country wench; so I suspect this lacquey will have to
live and die a lacquey all the days of his life.”
</p>
<p>
Here the Rodriguez’s daughter exclaimed, “Let him be who he
may, this man that claims me for a wife; I am thankful to him for the
same, for I had rather be the lawful wife of a lacquey than the cheated
mistress of a gentleman; though he who played me false is nothing of the
kind.”
</p>
<p>
To be brief, all the talk and all that had happened ended in Tosilos being
shut up until it was seen how his transformation turned out. All hailed
Don Quixote as victor, but the greater number were vexed and disappointed
at finding that the combatants they had been so anxiously waiting for had
not battered one another to pieces, just as the boys are disappointed when
the man they are waiting to see hanged does not come out, because the
prosecution or the court has pardoned him. The people dispersed, the duke
and Don Quixote returned to the castle, they locked up Tosilos, Doña
Rodriguez and her daughter remained perfectly contented when they saw that
any way the affair must end in marriage, and Tosilos wanted nothing else.

Don Quixote now felt it right to quit a life of such idleness as he was
leading in the castle; for he fancied that he was making himself sorely
missed by suffering himself to remain shut up and inactive amid the
countless luxuries and enjoyments his hosts lavished upon him as a knight,
and he felt too that he would have to render a strict account to heaven of
that indolence and seclusion; and so one day he asked the duke and duchess
to grant him permission to take his departure. They gave it, showing at
the same time that they were very sorry he was leaving them.

<p>
The duchess gave his wife’s letters to Sancho Panza, who shed tears
over them, saying, “Who would have thought that such grand hopes as
the news of my government bred in my wife Teresa Panza’s breast
would end in my going back now to the vagabond adventures of my master Don
Quixote of La Mancha? Still I’m glad to see my Teresa behaved as she
ought in sending the acorns, for if she had not sent them I’d have
been sorry, and she’d have shown herself ungrateful. It is a comfort
to me that they can’t call that present a bribe; for I had got the
government already when she sent them, and it’s but reasonable that
those who have had a good turn done them should show their gratitude, if
it’s only with a trifle. After all I went into the government naked,
and I come out of it naked; so I can say with a safe conscience—and
that’s no small matter—‘naked I was born, naked I find
myself, I neither lose nor gain.’”
</p>
<p>
Thus did Sancho soliloquise on the day of their departure, as Don Quixote,
who had the night before taken leave of the duke and duchess, coming out
made his appearance at an early hour in full armour in the courtyard of
the castle. The whole household of the castle were watching him from the
corridors, and the duke and duchess, too, came out to see him. Sancho was
mounted on his Dapple, with his alforjas, valise, and proven supremely
happy because the duke’s majordomo, the same that had acted the part
of the Trifaldi, had given him a little purse with two hundred gold crowns
to meet the necessary expenses of the road, but of this Don Quixote knew
nothing as yet. While all were, as has been said, observing him, suddenly
from among the duennas and handmaidens the impudent and witty Altisidora
lifted up her voice and said in pathetic tones:
</p>
<p class="poem">
Give ear, cruel knight;<br>
Draw rein; where’s the need<br>
Of spurring the flanks<br>
Of that ill-broken steed?<br>
From what art thou flying?<br>
No dragon I am,<br>
Not even a sheep,<br>
But a tender young lamb.<br>
Thou hast jilted a maiden<br>
As fair to behold<br>
As nymph of Diana<br>
Or Venus of old.<br>
Bireno, Æneas, what worse shall I call thee?<br>
Barabbas go with thee! All evil befall thee!<br>
<br>
In thy claws, ruthless robber,<br>
Thou bearest away<br>
The heart of a meek<br>
Loving maid for thy prey,<br>
Three kerchiefs thou stealest,<br>
And garters a pair,<br>
From legs than the whitest<br>
Of marble more fair;<br>
And the sighs that pursue thee<br>
Would burn to the ground<br>
Two thousand Troy Towns,<br>
If so many were found.<br>
Bireno, Æneas, what worse shall I call thee?<br>
Barabbas go with thee! All evil befall thee!<br>
<br>
May no bowels of mercy<br>
To Sancho be granted,<br>
And thy Dulcinea<br>
Be left still enchanted,<br>
May thy falsehood to me<br>
Find its punishment in her,<br>
For in my land the just<br>
Often pays for the sinner.<br>
May thy grandest adventures<br>
Discomfitures prove,<br>
May thy joys be all dreams,<br>
And forgotten thy love.<br>
Bireno, Æneas, what worse shall I call thee?<br>
Barabbas go with thee! All evil befall thee!<br>
<br>
May thy name be abhorred<br>
For thy conduct to ladies,<br>
From London to England,<br>
From Seville to Cadiz;<br>
May thy cards be unlucky,<br>
Thy hands contain ne’er a<br>
King, seven, or ace<br>
When thou playest primera;<br>
When thy corns are cut<br>
May it be to the quick;<br>
When thy grinders are drawn<br>
May the roots of them stick.<br>
Bireno, Æneas, what worse shall I call thee?<br>
Barabbas go with thee! All evil befall thee!<br>
</p>
<p>
All the while the unhappy Altisidora was bewailing herself in the above
strain Don Quixote stood staring at her; and without uttering a word in
reply to her he turned round to Sancho and said, “Sancho my friend,
I conjure thee by the life of thy forefathers tell me the truth; say, hast
thou by any chance taken the three kerchiefs and the garters this
love-sick maid speaks of?”
</p>
<p>
To this Sancho made answer, “The three kerchiefs I have; but the
garters, as much as ‘over the hills of Úbeda.’”
</p>
<p>
The duchess was amazed at Altisidora’s assurance; she knew that she
was bold, lively, and impudent, but not so much so as to venture to make
free in this fashion; and not being prepared for the joke, her
astonishment was all the greater. The duke had a mind to keep up the
sport, so he said, “It does not seem to me well done in you, sir
knight, that after having received the hospitality that has been offered
you in this very castle, you should have ventured to carry off even three
kerchiefs, not to say my handmaid’s garters. It shows a bad heart
and does not tally with your reputation. Restore her garters, or else I
defy you to mortal combat, for I am not afraid of rascally enchanters
changing or altering my features as they changed his who encountered you
into those of my lacquey, Tosilos.”
</p>
<p>
“God forbid,” said Don Quixote, “that I should draw my
sword against your illustrious person from which I have received such
great favours. The kerchiefs I will restore, as Sancho says he has them;
as to the garters that is impossible, for I have not got them, neither has
he; and if your handmaiden here will look in her hiding-places, depend
upon it she will find them. I have never been a thief, my lord duke, nor
do I mean to be so long as I live, if God cease not to have me in his
keeping. This damsel by her own confession speaks as one in love, for
which I am not to blame, and therefore need not ask pardon, either of her
or of your excellence, whom I entreat to have a better opinion of me, and
once more to give me leave to pursue my journey.”
</p>
<p>
“And may God so prosper it, Señor Don Quixote,” said the
duchess, “that we may always hear good news of your exploits; God
speed you; for the longer you stay, the more you inflame the hearts of the
damsels who behold you; and as for this one of mine, I will so chastise
her that she will not transgress again, either with her eyes or with her
words.”
</p>
<p>
“One word and no more, O valiant Don Quixote, I ask you to hear,”
said Altisidora, “and that is that I beg your pardon about the theft
of the garters; for by God and upon my soul I have got them on, and I have
fallen into the same blunder as he did who went looking for his ass being
all the while mounted on it.”
though Tosilos saw Don Quixote coming at him he never stirred a step from
</p>
<p>
“Didn’t I say so?” said Sancho. “I’m a
likely one to hide thefts! Why if I wanted to deal in them, opportunities
came ready enough to me in my government.”
</p>
<p>
Don Quixote bowed his head, and saluted the duke and duchess and all the
bystanders, and wheeling Rocinante round, Sancho following him on Dapple,
he rode out of the castle, shaping his course for Saragossa.

<p>
When Don Quixote saw himself in open country, free, and relieved from the
attentions of Altisidora, he felt at his ease, and in fresh spirits to
take up the pursuit of chivalry once more; and turning to Sancho, he said,
“Freedom, Sancho, is one of the most precious gifts that heaven has
bestowed upon men; no treasures that the earth holds buried or the sea
conceals can compare with it; for freedom, as for honour, life may and
should be ventured; and on the other hand, captivity is the greatest evil
condition.
that can fall to the lot of man. I say this, Sancho, because thou hast
orders Don Quixote, who was seated on a bench at the door, had for him,
seen the good cheer, the abundance we have enjoyed in this castle we are
leaving; well then, amid those dainty banquets and snow-cooled beverages I
felt as though I were undergoing the straits of hunger, because I did not
enjoy them with the same freedom as if they had been mine own; for the
sense of being under an obligation to return benefits and favours received
is a restraint that checks the independence of the spirit. Happy he, to
whom heaven has given a piece of bread for which he is not bound to give
thanks to any but heaven itself!”
</p>
<p>
“For all your worship says,” said Sancho, “it is not
becoming that there should be no thanks on our part for two hundred gold
crowns that the duke’s majordomo has given me in a little purse
which I carry next my heart, like a warming plaster or comforter, to meet
any chance calls; for we shan’t always find castles where they’ll
entertain us; now and then we may light upon roadside inns where they’ll
cudgel us.”
</p>
<p>
In conversation of this sort the knight and squire errant were pursuing
their journey, when, after they had gone a little more than half a league,
they perceived some dozen men dressed like labourers stretched upon their
cloaks on the grass of a green meadow eating their dinner. They had beside
them what seemed to be white sheets concealing some objects under them,
standing upright or lying flat, and arranged at intervals. Don Quixote
approached the diners, and, saluting them courteously first, he asked them
what it was those cloths covered. “Señor,” answered one of the
party, “under these cloths are some images carved in relief intended
for a retablo we are putting up in our village; we carry them covered up
that they may not be soiled, and on our shoulders that they may not be
broken.”
</p>
<p>
“With your good leave,” said Don Quixote, “I should like
to see them; for images that are carried so carefully no doubt must be
fine ones.”
</p>
<p>
“I should think they were!” said the other; “let the
money they cost speak for that; for as a matter of fact there is not one
of them that does not stand us in more than fifty ducats; and that your
worship may judge; wait a moment, and you shall see with your own eyes;”
and getting up from his dinner he went and uncovered the first image,
which proved to be one of Saint George on horseback with a serpent
writhing at his feet and the lance thrust down its throat with all that
fierceness that is usually depicted. The whole group was one blaze of
gold, as the saying is. On seeing it Don Quixote said, “That knight
was one of the best knights-errant the army of heaven ever owned; he was
called Don Saint George, and he was moreover a defender of maidens. Let us
see this next one.”
</p>
<p>
The man uncovered it, and it was seen to be that of Saint Martin on his
horse, dividing his cloak with the beggar. The instant Don Quixote saw it
he said, “This knight too was one of the Christian adventurers, but
I believe he was generous rather than valiant, as thou mayest perceive,
Sancho, by his dividing his cloak with the beggar and giving him half of
it; no doubt it was winter at the time, for otherwise he would have given
him the whole of it, so charitable was he.”
</p>
<p>
“It was not that, most likely,” said Sancho, “but that
he held with the proverb that says, ‘For giving and keeping there’s
need of brains.’”
</p>
<p>
Don Quixote laughed, and asked them to take off the next cloth, underneath
which was seen the image of the patron saint of the Spains seated on
horseback, his sword stained with blood, trampling on Moors and treading
heads underfoot; and on seeing it Don Quixote exclaimed, “Ay, this
is a knight, and of the squadrons of Christ! This one is called Don Saint
James the Moorslayer, one of the bravest saints and knights the world ever
had or heaven has now.”
</p>
<p>
They then raised another cloth which it appeared covered Saint Paul
falling from his horse, with all the details that are usually given in
representations of his conversion. When Don Quixote saw it, rendered in
such lifelike style that one would have said Christ was speaking and Paul
answering, “This,” he said, “was in his time the
greatest enemy that the Church of God our Lord had, and the greatest
champion it will ever have; a knight-errant in life, a steadfast saint in
death, an untiring labourer in the Lord’s vineyard, a teacher of the
Gentiles, whose school was heaven, and whose instructor and master was
Jesus Christ himself.”
</p>
<p>
There were no more images, so Don Quixote bade them cover them up again,
and said to those who had brought them, “I take it as a happy omen,
brothers, to have seen what I have; for these saints and knights were of
the same profession as myself, which is the calling of arms; only there is
this difference between them and me, that they were saints, and fought
with divine weapons, and I am a sinner and fight with human ones. They won
heaven by force of arms, for heaven suffereth violence; and I, so far,
know not what I have won by dint of my sufferings; but if my Dulcinea del
Toboso were to be released from hers, perhaps with mended fortunes and a
mind restored to itself I might direct my steps in a better path than I am
following at present.”
</p>
<p>
“May God hear and sin be deaf,” said Sancho to this.
</p>
<p>
The men were filled with wonder, as well at the figure as at the words of
Don Quixote, though they did not understand one half of what he meant by
them. They finished their dinner, took their images on their backs, and
bidding farewell to Don Quixote resumed their journey.
</p>
<p>
Sancho was amazed afresh at the extent of his master’s knowledge, as
much as if he had never known him, for it seemed to him that there was no
story or event in the world that he had not at his fingers’ ends and
fixed in his memory, and he said to him, “In truth, master mine, if
this that has happened to us to-day is to be called an adventure, it has
been one of the sweetest and pleasantest that have befallen us in the
whole course of our travels; we have come out of it unbelaboured and
undismayed, neither have we drawn sword nor have we smitten the earth with
our bodies, nor have we been left famishing; blessed be God that he has
let me see such a thing with my own eyes!”
</p>
<p>
“Thou sayest well, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “but
remember all times are not alike nor do they always run the same way; and
these things the vulgar commonly call omens, which are not based upon any
natural reason, will by him who is wise be esteemed and reckoned happy
accidents merely. One of these believers in omens will get up of a
morning, leave his house, and meet a friar of the order of the blessed
Saint Francis, and, as if he had met a griffin, he will turn about and go
home. With another Mendoza the salt is spilt on his table, and gloom is
spilt over his heart, as if nature was obliged to give warning of coming
misfortunes by means of such trivial things as these. The wise man and the
Christian should not trifle with what it may please heaven to do. Scipio
on coming to Africa stumbled as he leaped on shore; his soldiers took it
as a bad omen; but he, clasping the soil with his arms, exclaimed, ‘Thou
canst not escape me, Africa, for I hold thee tight between my arms.’
Thus, Sancho, meeting those images has been to me a most happy occurrence.”
</p>
<p>
“I can well believe it,” said Sancho; “but I wish your
worship would tell me what is the reason that the Spaniards, when they are
about to give battle, in calling on that Saint James the Moorslayer, say
‘Santiago and close Spain!’ Is Spain, then, open, so that it
is needful to close it; or what is the meaning of this form?”
</p>
<p>
“Thou art very simple, Sancho,” said Don Quixote; “God,
look you, gave that great knight of the Red Cross to Spain as her patron
saint and protector, especially in those hard struggles the Spaniards had
with the Moors; and therefore they invoke and call upon him as their
defender in all their battles; and in these he has been many a time seen
beating down, trampling under foot, destroying and slaughtering the
Hagarene squadrons in the sight of all; of which fact I could give thee
many examples recorded in truthful Spanish histories.”
</p>
<p>
Sancho changed the subject, and said to his master, “I marvel,
señor, at the boldness of Altisidora, the duchess’s handmaid; he
whom they call Love must have cruelly pierced and wounded her; they say he
is a little blind urchin who, though blear-eyed, or more properly speaking
sightless, if he aims at a heart, be it ever so small, hits it and pierces
it through and through with his arrows. I have heard it said too that the
arrows of Love are blunted and robbed of their points by maidenly modesty
and reserve; but with this Altisidora it seems they are sharpened rather
than blunted.”
</p>
<p>
“Bear in mind, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “that love is
influenced by no consideration, recognises no restraints of reason, and is
of the same nature as death, that assails alike the lofty palaces of kings
and the humble cabins of shepherds; and when it takes entire possession of
a heart, the first thing it does is to banish fear and shame from it; and
so without shame Altisidora declared her passion, which excited in my mind
embarrassment rather than commiseration.”
</p>
<p>
“Notable cruelty!” exclaimed Sancho; “unheard-of
ingratitude! I can only say for myself that the very smallest loving word
of hers would have subdued me and made a slave of me. The devil! What a
heart of marble, what bowels of brass, what a soul of mortar! But I can’t
imagine what it is that this damsel saw in your worship that could have
conquered and captivated her so. What gallant figure was it, what bold
bearing, what sprightly grace, what comeliness of feature, which of these
things by itself, or what all together, could have made her fall in love
with you? For indeed and in truth many a time I stop to look at your
worship from the sole of your foot to the topmost hair of your head, and I
see more to frighten one than to make one fall in love; moreover I have
heard say that beauty is the first and main thing that excites love, and
as your worship has none at all, I don’t know what the poor creature
fell in love with.”
</p>
<p>
“Recollect, Sancho,” replied Don Quixote, “there are two
sorts of beauty, one of the mind, the other of the body; that of the mind
displays and exhibits itself in intelligence, in modesty, in honourable
conduct, in generosity, in good breeding; and all these qualities are
possible and may exist in an ugly man; and when it is this sort of beauty
and not that of the body that is the attraction, love is apt to spring up
suddenly and violently. I, Sancho, perceive clearly enough that I am not
beautiful, but at the same time I know I am not hideous; and it is enough
for an honest man not to be a monster to be an object of love, if only he
possesses the endowments of mind I have mentioned.”
</p>
<p>
While engaged in this discourse they were making their way through a wood
that lay beyond the road, when suddenly, without expecting anything of the
kind, Don Quixote found himself caught in some nets of green cord
stretched from one tree to another; and unable to conceive what it could
be, he said to Sancho, “Sancho, it strikes me this affair of these
nets will prove one of the strangest adventures imaginable. May I die if
the enchanters that persecute me are not trying to entangle me in them and
delay my journey, by way of revenge for my obduracy towards Altisidora.
Well then let me tell them that if these nets, instead of being green
cord, were made of the hardest diamonds, or stronger than that wherewith
the jealous god of blacksmiths enmeshed Venus and Mars, I would break them
as easily as if they were made of rushes or cotton threads.” But
just as he was about to press forward and break through all, suddenly from
among some trees two shepherdesses of surpassing beauty presented
themselves to his sight—or at least damsels dressed like
shepherdesses, save that their jerkins and sayas were of fine brocade;
that is to say, the sayas were rich farthingales of gold embroidered
tabby. Their hair, that in its golden brightness vied with the beams of
the sun itself, fell loose upon their shoulders and was crowned with
garlands twined with green laurel and red everlasting; and their years to
all appearance were not under fifteen nor above eighteen.

</p>
<p>
Such was the spectacle that filled Sancho with amazement, fascinated Don
Quixote, made the sun halt in his course to behold them, and held all four
in a strange silence. One of the shepherdesses, at length, was the first
to speak and said to Don Quixote, “Hold, sir knight, and do not
</p>
break these nets; for they are not spread here to do you any harm, but
only for our amusement; and as I know you will ask why they have been put
up, and who we are, I will tell you in a few words. In a village some two
leagues from this, where there are many people of quality and rich
gentlefolk, it was agreed upon by a number of friends and relations to
come with their wives, sons and daughters, neighbours, friends and
kinsmen, and make holiday in this spot, which is one of the pleasantest in
the whole neighbourhood, setting up a new pastoral Arcadia among
ourselves, we maidens dressing ourselves as shepherdesses and the youths
as shepherds. We have prepared two eclogues, one by the famous poet
Garcilasso, the other by the most excellent Camoens, in its own Portuguese
tongue, but we have not as yet acted them. Yesterday was the first day of
our coming here; we have a few of what they say are called field-tents
pitched among the trees on the bank of an ample brook that fertilises all
these meadows; last night we spread these nets in the trees here to snare
the silly little birds that startled by the noise we make may fly into
them. If you please to be our guest, señor, you will be welcomed heartily
and courteously, for here just now neither care nor sorrow shall enter.”
</p>
<p>
She held her peace and said no more, and Don Quixote made answer, “Of
a truth, fairest lady, Actaeon when he unexpectedly beheld Diana bathing
in the stream could not have been more fascinated and wonderstruck than I
at the sight of your beauty. I commend your mode of entertainment, and
thank you for the kindness of your invitation; and if I can serve you, you
may command me with full confidence of being obeyed, for my profession is
none other than to show myself grateful, and ready to serve persons of all
conditions, but especially persons of quality such as your appearance
indicates; and if, instead of taking up, as they probably do, but a small
space, these nets took up the whole surface of the globe, I would seek out
new worlds through which to pass, so as not to break them; and that ye may
give some degree of credence to this exaggerated language of mine, know
that it is no less than Don Quixote of La Mancha that makes this
declaration to you, if indeed it be that such a name has reached your
ears.”
</p>
<p>
“Ah! friend of my soul,” instantly exclaimed the other
shepherdess, “what great good fortune has befallen us! Seest thou
this gentleman we have before us? Well then let me tell thee he is the
most valiant and the most devoted and the most courteous gentleman in all
the world, unless a history of his achievements that has been printed and
I have read is telling lies and deceiving us. I will lay a wager that this
good fellow who is with him is one Sancho Panza his squire, whose
drolleries none can equal.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s true,” said Sancho; “I am that same droll
and squire you speak of, and this gentleman is my master Don Quixote of La
Mancha, the same that’s in the history and that they talk about.”
</p>
natural reason, will by him who is wise be esteemed and reckoned happy
<p>
“Oh, my friend,” said the other, “let us entreat him to
stay; for it will give our fathers and brothers infinite pleasure; I too
have heard just what thou hast told me of the valour of the one and the
drolleries of the other; and what is more, of him they say that he is the
most constant and loyal lover that was ever heard of, and that his lady is
one Dulcinea del Toboso, to whom all over Spain the palm of beauty is
awarded.”
</p>
<p>
“And justly awarded,” said Don Quixote, “unless, indeed,
your unequalled beauty makes it a matter of doubt. But spare yourselves
the trouble, ladies, of pressing me to stay, for the urgent calls of my
profession do not allow me to take rest under any circumstances.”
</p>
<p>
At this instant there came up to the spot where the four stood a brother
of one of the two shepherdesses, like them in shepherd costume, and as
richly and gaily dressed as they were. They told him that their companion
was the valiant Don Quixote of La Mancha, and the other Sancho his squire,
of whom he knew already from having read their history. The gay shepherd
offered him his services and begged that he would accompany him to their
tents, and Don Quixote had to give way and comply. And now the game was
started, and the nets were filled with a variety of birds that deceived by
the colour fell into the danger they were flying from. Upwards of thirty
persons, all gaily attired as shepherds and shepherdesses, assembled on
the spot, and were at once informed who Don Quixote and his squire were,
whereat they were not a little delighted, as they knew of him already
through his history. They repaired to the tents, where they found tables
laid out, and choicely, plentifully, and neatly furnished. They treated
Don Quixote as a person of distinction, giving him the place of honour,
and all observed him, and were full of astonishment at the spectacle. At
last the cloth being removed, Don Quixote with great composure lifted up
his voice and said:
</p>
<p>
“One of the greatest sins that men are guilty of is—some will
say pride—but I say ingratitude, going by the common saying that
hell is full of ingrates. This sin, so far as it has lain in my power, I
have endeavoured to avoid ever since I have enjoyed the faculty of reason;
and if I am unable to requite good deeds that have been done me by other
deeds, I substitute the desire to do so; and if that be not enough I make
them known publicly; for he who declares and makes known the good deeds
done to him would repay them by others if it were in his power, and for
the most part those who receive are the inferiors of those who give. Thus,
God is superior to all because he is the supreme giver, and the offerings
of man fall short by an infinite distance of being a full return for the
gifts of God; but gratitude in some degree makes up for this deficiency
and shortcoming. I therefore, grateful for the favour that has been
extended to me here, and unable to make a return in the same measure,
restricted as I am by the narrow limits of my power, offer what I can and
what I have to offer in my own way; and so I declare that for two full
days I will maintain in the middle of this highway leading to Saragossa,
that these ladies disguised as shepherdesses, who are here present, are
the fairest and most courteous maidens in the world, excepting only the
peerless Dulcinea del Toboso, sole mistress of my thoughts, be it said
without offence to those who hear me, ladies and gentlemen.”
</p>
<p>
On hearing this Sancho, who had been listening with great attention, cried
out in a loud voice, “Is it possible there is anyone in the world
who will dare to say and swear that this master of mine is a madman? Say,
gentlemen shepherds, is there a village priest, be he ever so wise or
learned, who could say what my master has said; or is there knight-errant,
whatever renown he may have as a man of valour, that could offer what my
master has offered now?”
</p>
<p>
Don Quixote turned upon Sancho, and with a countenance glowing with anger
said to him, “Is it possible, Sancho, there is anyone in the whole
world who will say thou art not a fool, with a lining to match, and I know
not what trimmings of impertinence and roguery? Who asked thee to meddle
in my affairs, or to inquire whether I am a wise man or a blockhead? Hold
thy peace; answer me not a word; saddle Rocinante if he be unsaddled; and
let us go to put my offer into execution; for with the right that I have
on my side thou mayest reckon as vanquished all who shall venture to
question it;” and in a great rage, and showing his anger plainly, he
rose from his seat, leaving the company lost in wonder, and making them
feel doubtful whether they ought to regard him as a madman or a rational
being. In the end, though they sought to dissuade him from involving
himself in such a challenge, assuring him they admitted his gratitude as
fully established, and needed no fresh proofs to be convinced of his
valiant spirit, as those related in the history of his exploits were
sufficient, still Don Quixote persisted in his resolve; and mounted on
Rocinante, bracing his buckler on his arm and grasping his lance, he
posted himself in the middle of a high road that was not far from the
green meadow. Sancho followed on Dapple, together with all the members of
the pastoral gathering, eager to see what would be the upshot of his
vainglorious and extraordinary proposal.
</p>
<p>
Don Quixote, then, having, as has been said, planted himself in the middle
of the road, made the welkin ring with words to this effect: “Ho ye
travellers and wayfarers, knights, squires, folk on foot or on horseback,
who pass this way or shall pass in the course of the next two days! Know
that Don Quixote of La Mancha, knight-errant, is posted here to maintain
by arms that the beauty and courtesy enshrined in the nymphs that dwell in
these meadows and groves surpass all upon earth, putting aside the lady of
my heart, Dulcinea del Toboso. Wherefore, let him who is of the opposite
opinion come on, for here I await him.”
</p>
<p>
Twice he repeated the same words, and twice they fell unheard by any
adventurer; but fate, that was guiding affairs for him from better to
better, so ordered it that shortly afterwards there appeared on the road a
crowd of men on horseback, many of them with lances in their hands, all
riding in a compact body and in great haste. No sooner had those who were
with Don Quixote seen them than they turned about and withdrew to some
distance from the road, for they knew that if they stayed some harm might
come to them; but Don Quixote with intrepid heart stood his ground, and
Sancho Panza shielded himself with Rocinante’s hind-quarters. The
troop of lancers came up, and one of them who was in advance began
shouting to Don Quixote, “Get out of the way, you son of the devil,
or these bulls will knock you to pieces!”
</p>
<p>
“Rabble!” returned Don Quixote, “I care nothing for
bulls, be they the fiercest Jarama breeds on its banks. Confess at once,
scoundrels, that what I have declared is true; else ye have to deal with
me in combat.”
</p>
<p>
The herdsman had no time to reply, nor Don Quixote to get out of the way
even if he wished; and so the drove of fierce bulls and tame bullocks,
<div class="fig" style="width:60%;">
together with the crowd of herdsmen and others who were taking them to be
penned up in a village where they were to be run the next day, passed over
Don Quixote and over Sancho, Rocinante and Dapple, hurling them all to the
earth and rolling them over on the ground. Sancho was left crushed, Don
Quixote scared, Dapple belaboured and Rocinante in no very sound
condition.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
They all got up, however, at length, and Don Quixote in great haste,
stumbling here and falling there, started off running after the drove,
shouting out, “Hold! stay! ye rascally rabble, a single knight
awaits you, and he is not of the temper or opinion of those who say,
‘For a flying enemy make a bridge of silver.’” The
retreating party in their haste, however, did not stop for that, or heed
his menaces any more than last year’s clouds. Weariness brought Don
Quixote to a halt, and more enraged than avenged he sat down on the road
to wait until Sancho, Rocinante and Dapple came up. When they reached him
master and man mounted once more, and without going back to bid farewell
to the mock or imitation Arcadia, and more in humiliation than
contentment, they continued their journey.

A clear limpid spring which they discovered in a cool grove relieved Don
Quixote and Sancho of the dust and fatigue due to the unpolite behaviour
of the bulls, and by the side of this, having turned Dapple and Rocinante
loose without headstall or bridle, the forlorn pair, master and man,
seated themselves. Sancho had recourse to the larder of his alforjas and
took out of them what he called the prog; Don Quixote rinsed his mouth and
bathed his face, by which cooling process his flagging energies were
revived. Out of pure vexation he remained without eating, and out of pure
politeness Sancho did not venture to touch a morsel of what was before
him, but waited for his master to act as taster. Seeing, however, that,
absorbed in thought, he was forgetting to carry the bread to his mouth, he
said never a word, and trampling every sort of good breeding under foot,
began to stow away in his paunch the bread and cheese that came to his
hand.

</p>
<p>
“Eat, Sancho my friend,” said Don Quixote; “support
life, which is of more consequence to thee than to me, and leave me to die
under the pain of my thoughts and pressure of my misfortunes. I was born,
Sancho, to live dying, and thou to die eating; and to prove the truth of
what I say, look at me, printed in histories, famed in arms, courteous in
behaviour, honoured by princes, courted by maidens; and after all, when I
looked forward to palms, triumphs, and crowns, won and earned by my
valiant deeds, I have this morning seen myself trampled on, kicked, and
crushed by the feet of unclean and filthy animals. This thought blunts my
teeth, paralyses my jaws, cramps my hands, and robs me of all appetite for
food; so much so that I have a mind to let myself die of hunger, the
cruelest death of all deaths.”
</p>
<p>
“So then,” said Sancho, munching hard all the time, “your
worship does not agree with the proverb that says, ‘Let Martha die,
but let her die with a full belly.’ I, at any rate, have no mind to
kill myself; so far from that, I mean to do as the cobbler does, who
stretches the leather with his teeth until he makes it reach as far as he
wants. I’ll stretch out my life by eating until it reaches the end
heaven has fixed for it; and let me tell you, señor, there’s no
greater folly than to think of dying of despair as your worship does; take
my advice, and after eating lie down and sleep a bit on this green
grass-mattress, and you will see that when you awake you’ll feel
something better.”
</p>
<p>
Don Quixote did as he recommended, for it struck him that Sancho’s
reasoning was more like a philosopher’s than a blockhead’s,
and said he, “Sancho, if thou wilt do for me what I am going to tell
thee my ease of mind would be more assured and my heaviness of heart not
so great; and it is this; to go aside a little while I am sleeping in
accordance with thy advice, and, making bare thy carcase to the air, to
give thyself three or four hundred lashes with Rocinante’s reins, on
account of the three thousand and odd thou art to give thyself for the
disenchantment of Dulcinea; for it is a great pity that the poor lady
should be left enchanted through thy carelessness and negligence.”
</p>
<p>
“There is a good deal to be said on that point,” said Sancho;
“let us both go to sleep now, and after that, God has decreed what
will happen. Let me tell your worship that for a man to whip himself in
cold blood is a hard thing, especially if the stripes fall upon an
ill-nourished and worse-fed body. Let my lady Dulcinea have patience, and
when she is least expecting it, she will see me made a riddle of with
whipping, and ‘until death it’s all life;’ I mean that I
have still life in me, and the desire to make good what I have promised.”
</p>
<p>
Don Quixote thanked him, and ate a little, and Sancho a good deal, and
then they both lay down to sleep, leaving those two inseparable friends
and comrades, Rocinante and Dapple, to their own devices and to feed
unrestrained upon the abundant grass with which the meadow was furnished.
They woke up rather late, mounted once more and resumed their journey,
pushing on to reach an inn which was in sight, apparently a league off. I
say an inn, because Don Quixote called it so, contrary to his usual
practice of calling all inns castles. They reached it, and asked the
landlord if they could put up there. He said yes, with as much comfort and
as good fare as they could find in Saragossa. They dismounted, and Sancho
stowed away his larder in a room of which the landlord gave him the key.
He took the beasts to the stable, fed them, and came back to see what
orders Don Quixote, who was seated on a bench at the door, had for him,
giving special thanks to heaven that this inn had not been taken for a
castle by his master. Supper-time came, and they repaired to their room,
and Sancho asked the landlord what he had to give them for supper. To this
the landlord replied that his mouth should be the measure; he had only to
ask what he would; for that inn was provided with the birds of the air and
the fowls of the earth and the fish of the sea.
</p>
<p>
“There’s no need of all that,” said Sancho; “if
they’ll roast us a couple of chickens we’ll be satisfied, for
my master is delicate and eats little, and I’m not over and above
gluttonous.”
</p>
<p>
The landlord replied he had no chickens, for the kites had stolen them.
</p>
<p>
“Well then,” said Sancho, “let señor landlord tell them
to roast a pullet, so that it is a tender one.”
</p>
<p>
“Pullet! My father!” said the landlord; “indeed and in
truth it’s only yesterday I sent over fifty to the city to sell; but
saving pullets ask what you will.”
</p>
<p>
“In that case,” said Sancho, “you will not be without
veal or kid.”
</p>
<p>
“Just now,” said the landlord, “there’s none in
the house, for it’s all finished; but next week there will be enough
and to spare.”
</p>
<p>
“Much good that does us,” said Sancho; “I’ll lay a
bet that all these short-comings are going to wind up in plenty of bacon
and eggs.”
</p>
<p>
“By God,” said the landlord, “my guest’s wits must
be precious dull; I tell him I have neither pullets nor hens, and he wants
me to have eggs! Talk of other dainties, if you please, and don’t
ask for hens again.”
</p>
<p>
“Body o’ me!” said Sancho, “let’s settle the
matter; say at once what you have got, and let us have no more words about
it.”
</p>
<p>
“In truth and earnest, señor guest,” said the landlord,
“all I have is a couple of cow-heels like calves’ feet, or a
couple of calves’ feet like cowheels; they are boiled with
chick-peas, onions, and bacon, and at this moment they are crying ‘Come
eat me, come eat me.”
</p>
<p>
“I mark them for mine on the spot,” said Sancho; “let
nobody touch them; I’ll pay better for them than anyone else, for I
upon it she will find them. I have never been a thief, my lord duke, nor
could not wish for anything more to my taste; and I don’t care a pin
whether they are feet or heels.”
</p>
<p>
“Nobody shall touch them,” said the landlord; “for the
other guests I have, being persons of high quality, bring their own cook
and caterer and larder with them.”
</p>
<p>
“If you come to people of quality,” said Sancho, “there’s
nobody more so than my master; but the calling he follows does not allow
of larders or store-rooms; we lay ourselves down in the middle of a
meadow, and fill ourselves with acorns or medlars.”
</p>
<p>
Here ended Sancho’s conversation with the landlord, Sancho not
caring to carry it any farther by answering him; for he had already asked
him what calling or what profession it was his master was of.
</p>
<p>
Supper-time having come, then, Don Quixote betook himself to his room, the
landlord brought in the stew-pan just as it was, and he sat himself down
to sup very resolutely. It seems that in another room, which was next to
Don Quixote’s, with nothing but a thin partition to separate it, he
overheard these words, “As you live, Señor Don Jeronimo, while they
are bringing supper, let us read another chapter of the Second Part of
‘Don Quixote of La Mancha.’”
</p>
<p>
The instant Don Quixote heard his own name he started to his feet and
listened with open ears to catch what they said about him, and heard the
Don Jeronimo who had been addressed say in reply, “Why would you
have us read that absurd stuff, Don Juan, when it is impossible for anyone
who has read the First Part of the history of ‘Don Quixote of La
Mancha’ to take any pleasure in reading this Second Part?”
</p>
<p>
“For all that,” said he who was addressed as Don Juan, “we
shall do well to read it, for there is no book so bad but it has something
good in it. What displeases me most in it is that it represents Don
Quixote as now cured of his love for Dulcinea del Toboso.”
</p>
<p>
On hearing this Don Quixote, full of wrath and indignation, lifted up his
voice and said, “Whoever he may be who says that Don Quixote of La
Mancha has forgotten or can forget Dulcinea del Toboso, I will teach him
with equal arms that what he says is very far from the truth; for neither
can the peerless Dulcinea del Toboso be forgotten, nor can forgetfulness
have a place in Don Quixote; his motto is constancy, and his profession to
maintain the same with his life and never wrong it.”
</p>
<p>
“Who is this that answers us?” said they in the next room.
</p>
<p>
“Who should it be,” said Sancho, “but Don Quixote of La
Mancha himself, who will make good all he has said and all he will say;
for pledges don’t trouble a good payer.”
</p>
<p>
Sancho had hardly uttered these words when two gentlemen, for such they
seemed to be, entered the room, and one of them, throwing his arms round
