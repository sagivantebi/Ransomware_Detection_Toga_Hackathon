even though the soul in thy body fail thee; so come on now behind me
slowly as well as thou canst, and make lanterns of thine eyes; let us make
the circuit of this ridge; perhaps we shall light upon this man that we
saw, who no doubt is no other than the owner of what we found.”
</p>
<p>
To which Sancho made answer, “Far better would it be not to look for him,
for, if we find him, and he happens to be the owner of the money, it is
plain I must restore it; it would be better, therefore, that without
taking this needless trouble, I should keep possession of it until in some
other less meddlesome and officious way the real owner may be discovered;
and perhaps that will be when I shall have spent it, and then the king
will hold me harmless.”
</p>
<p>
“Thou art wrong there, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “for now that we have a
suspicion who the owner is, and have him almost before us, we are bound to
seek him and make restitution; and if we do not see him, the strong
suspicion we have as to his being the owner makes us as guilty as if he
were so; and so, friend Sancho, let not our search for him give thee any
uneasiness, for if we find him it will relieve mine.”
</p>
<p>
And so saying he gave Rocinante the spur, and Sancho followed him on foot
and loaded, and after having partly made the circuit of the mountain they
found lying in a ravine, dead and half devoured by dogs and pecked by
jackdaws, a mule saddled and bridled, all which still further strengthened
their suspicion that he who had fled was the owner of the mule and the
saddle-pad.

<p>
As they stood looking at it they heard a whistle like that of a shepherd
watching his flock, and suddenly on their left there appeared a great
number of goats and behind them on the summit of the mountain the goatherd
in charge of them, a man advanced in years. Don Quixote called aloud to
him and begged him to come down to where they stood. He shouted in return,
asking what had brought them to that spot, seldom or never trodden except
by the feet of goats, or of the wolves and other wild beasts that roamed
around. Sancho in return bade him come down, and they would explain all to
him.
</p>
<p>
The goatherd descended, and reaching the place where Don Quixote stood, he
said, “I will wager you are looking at that hack mule that lies dead in
the hollow there, and, faith, it has been lying there now these six
months; tell me, have you come upon its master about here?”
</p>
<p>
“We have come upon nobody,” answered Don Quixote, “nor on anything except
a saddle-pad and a little valise that we found not far from this.”
</p>
<p>
“I found it too,” said the goatherd, “but I would not lift it nor go near
it for fear of some ill-luck or being charged with theft, for the devil is
crafty, and things rise up under one’s feet to make one fall without
knowing why or wherefore.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s exactly what I say,” said Sancho; “I found it too, and I would not
go within a stone’s throw of it; there I left it, and there it lies just
as it was, for I don’t want a dog with a bell.”
</p>
<p>
“Tell me, good man,” said Don Quixote, “do you know who is the owner of
this property?”
</p>
<p>
“All I can tell you,” said the goatherd, “is that about six months ago,
more or less, there arrived at a shepherd’s hut three leagues, perhaps,
away from this, a youth of well-bred appearance and manners, mounted on
that same mule which lies dead here, and with the same saddle-pad and
valise which you say you found and did not touch. He asked us what part of
this sierra was the most rugged and retired; we told him that it was where
we now are; and so in truth it is, for if you push on half a league
farther, perhaps you will not be able to find your way out; and I am
wondering how you have managed to come here, for there is no road or path
that leads to this spot. I say, then, that on hearing our answer the youth
turned about and made for the place we pointed out to him, leaving us all
charmed with his good looks, and wondering at his question and the haste
with which we saw him depart in the direction of the sierra; and after
that we saw him no more, until some days afterwards he crossed the path of
one of our shepherds, and without saying a word to him, came up to him and
gave him several cuffs and kicks, and then turned to the ass with our
provisions and took all the bread and cheese it carried, and having done
this made off back again into the sierra with extraordinary swiftness.
When some of us goatherds learned this we went in search of him for about
two days through the most remote portion of this sierra, at the end of
which we found him lodged in the hollow of a large thick cork tree. He
came out to meet us with great gentleness, with his dress now torn and his
face so disfigured and burned by the sun, that we hardly recognised him
but that his clothes, though torn, convinced us, from the recollection we
had of them, that he was the person we were looking for. He saluted us
courteously, and in a few well-spoken words he told us not to wonder at
seeing him going about in this guise, as it was binding upon him in order
that he might work out a penance which for his many sins had been imposed
upon him. We asked him to tell us who he was, but we were never able to
find out from him: we begged of him too, when he was in want of food,
which he could not do without, to tell us where we should find him, as we
would bring it to him with all good-will and readiness; or if this were
not to his taste, at least to come and ask it of us and not take it by
force from the shepherds. He thanked us for the offer, begged pardon for
the late assault, and promised for the future to ask it in God’s name
without offering violence to anybody. As for fixed abode, he said he had
no other than that which chance offered wherever night might overtake him;
and his words ended in an outburst of weeping so bitter that we who
listened to him must have been very stones had we not joined him in it,
comparing what we saw of him the first time with what we saw now; for, as
I said, he was a graceful and gracious youth, and in his courteous and
polished language showed himself to be of good birth and courtly breeding,
and rustics as we were that listened to him, even to our rusticity his
gentle bearing sufficed to make it plain.
</p>
<p>
“But in the midst of his conversation he stopped and became silent,
keeping his eyes fixed upon the ground for some time, during which we
stood still waiting anxiously to see what would come of this abstraction;
and with no little pity, for from his behaviour, now staring at the ground
with fixed gaze and eyes wide open without moving an eyelid, again closing
them, compressing his lips and raising his eyebrows, we could perceive
plainly that a fit of madness of some kind had come upon him; and before
long he showed that what we imagined was the truth, for he arose in a fury
from the ground where he had thrown himself, and attacked the first he
found near him with such rage and fierceness that if we had not dragged
him off him, he would have beaten or bitten him to death, all the while
exclaiming, ‘Oh faithless Fernando, here, here shalt thou pay the penalty
of the wrong thou hast done me; these hands shall tear out that heart of
thine, abode and dwelling of all iniquity, but of deceit and fraud above
all; and to these he added other words all in effect upbraiding this
Fernando and charging him with treachery and faithlessness.
</p>
<p>
“We forced him to release his hold with no little difficulty, and without
another word he left us, and rushing off plunged in among these brakes and
brambles, so as to make it impossible for us to follow him; from this we
suppose that madness comes upon him from time to time, and that someone
called Fernando must have done him a wrong of a grievous nature such as
the condition to which it had brought him seemed to show. All this has
been since then confirmed on those occasions, and they have been many, on
which he has crossed our path, at one time to beg the shepherds to give
him some of the food they carry, at another to take it from them by force;
for when there is a fit of madness upon him, even though the shepherds
offer it freely, he will not accept it but snatches it from them by dint
of blows; but when he is in his senses he begs it for the love of God,
courteously and civilly, and receives it with many thanks and not a few
tears. And to tell you the truth, sirs,” continued the goatherd, “it was
yesterday that we resolved, I and four of the lads, two of them our
servants, and the other two friends of mine, to go in search of him until
we find him, and when we do to take him, whether by force or of his own
consent, to the town of Almodóvar, which is eight leagues from this, and
there strive to cure him (if indeed his malady admits of a cure), or learn
when he is in his senses who he is, and if he has relatives to whom we may
give notice of his misfortune. This, sirs, is all I can say in answer to
what you have asked me; and be sure that the owner of the articles you
found is he whom you saw pass by with such nimbleness and so naked.”
</p>
<p>
For Don Quixote had already described how he had seen the man go bounding
along the mountainside, and he was now filled with amazement at what he
heard from the goatherd, and more eager than ever to discover who the
unhappy madman was; and in his heart he resolved, as he had done before,
to search for him all over the mountain, not leaving a corner or cave
unexamined until he had found him. But chance arranged matters better than
he expected or hoped, for at that very moment, in a gorge on the mountain
that opened where they stood, the youth he wished to find made his
appearance, coming along talking to himself in a way that would have been
unintelligible near at hand, much more at a distance. His garb was what
has been described, save that as he drew near, Don Quixote perceived that
a tattered doublet which he wore was amber-tanned, from which he concluded
that one who wore such garments could not be of very low rank.
</p>
<p>
Approaching them, the youth greeted them in a harsh and hoarse voice but
with great courtesy. Don Quixote returned his salutation with equal
politeness, and dismounting from Rocinante advanced with well-bred bearing
and grace to embrace him, and held him for some time close in his arms as
if he had known him for a long time. The other, whom we may call the
Ragged One of the Sorry Countenance, as Don Quixote was of the Rueful,
after submitting to the embrace pushed him back a little and, placing his
hands on Don Quixote’s shoulders, stood gazing at him as if seeking to see
whether he knew him, not less amazed, perhaps, at the sight of the face,
figure, and armour of Don Quixote than Don Quixote was at the sight of
him. To be brief, the first to speak after embracing was the Ragged One,
and he said what will be told farther on.

</p>
<p>
The history relates that it was with the greatest attention Don Quixote
listened to the ragged knight of the Sierra, who began by saying:
</p>
<p>
“Of a surety, señor, whoever you are, for I know you not, I thank you for
the proofs of kindness and courtesy you have shown me, and would I were in
a condition to requite with something more than good-will that which you
have displayed towards me in the cordial reception you have given me; but
my fate does not afford me any other means of returning kindnesses done me
save the hearty desire to repay them.”
</p>
<p>
“Mine,” replied Don Quixote, “is to be of service to you, so much so that
I had resolved not to quit these mountains until I had found you, and
learned of you whether there is any kind of relief to be found for that
sorrow under which from the strangeness of your life you seem to labour;
and to search for you with all possible diligence, if search had been
necessary. And if your misfortune should prove to be one of those that
refuse admission to any sort of consolation, it was my purpose to join you
in lamenting and mourning over it, so far as I could; for it is still some
comfort in misfortune to find one who can feel for it. And if my good
intentions deserve to be acknowledged with any kind of courtesy, I entreat
you, señor, by that which I perceive you possess in so high a degree, and
likewise conjure you by whatever you love or have loved best in life, to
tell me who you are and the cause that has brought you to live or die in
these solitudes like a brute beast, dwelling among them in a manner so
foreign to your condition as your garb and appearance show. And I swear,”
added Don Quixote, “by the order of knighthood which I have received, and
by my vocation of knight-errant, if you gratify me in this, to serve you
with all the zeal my calling demands of me, either in relieving your
misfortune if it admits of relief, or in joining you in lamenting it as I
promised to do.”
</p>
<p>
The Knight of the Thicket, hearing him of the Rueful Countenance talk in
this strain, did nothing but stare at him, and stare at him again, and
again survey him from head to foot; and when he had thoroughly examined
him, he said to him:
</p>
<p>
“If you have anything to give me to eat, for God’s sake give it me, and
after I have eaten I will do all you ask in acknowledgment of the goodwill
you have displayed towards me.”
</p>
<p>
Sancho from his sack, and the goatherd from his pouch, furnished the
Ragged One with the means of appeasing his hunger, and what they gave him
he ate like a half-witted being, so hastily that he took no time between
mouthfuls, gorging rather than swallowing; and while he ate neither he nor
they who observed him uttered a word. As soon as he had done he made signs
to them to follow him, which they did, and he led them to a green plot
which lay a little farther off round the corner of a rock. On reaching it
he stretched himself upon the grass, and the others did the same, all
keeping silence, until the Ragged One, settling himself in his place,
said:
</p>
<p>
“If it is your wish, sirs, that I should disclose in a few words the
surpassing extent of my misfortunes, you must promise not to break the
thread of my sad story with any question or other interruption, for the
instant you do so the tale I tell will come to an end.”
</p>
<p>
These words of the Ragged One reminded Don Quixote of the tale his squire
had told him, when he failed to keep count of the goats that had crossed
the river and the story remained unfinished; but to return to the Ragged
One, he went on to say:
</p>
<p>
“I give you this warning because I wish to pass briefly over the story of
my misfortunes, for recalling them to memory only serves to add fresh
ones, and the less you question me the sooner shall I make an end of the
recital, though I shall not omit to relate anything of importance in order
fully to satisfy your curiosity.”
</p>
<p>
Don Quixote gave the promise for himself and the others, and with this
assurance he began as follows:
</p>
<p>
“My name is Cardenio, my birthplace one of the best cities of this
Andalusia, my family noble, my parents rich, my misfortune so great that
my parents must have wept and my family grieved over it without being able
by their wealth to lighten it; for the gifts of fortune can do little to
relieve reverses sent by Heaven. In that same country there was a heaven
in which love had placed all the glory I could desire; such was the beauty
of Luscinda, a damsel as noble and as rich as I, but of happier fortunes,
and of less firmness than was due to so worthy a passion as mine. This
Luscinda I loved, worshipped, and adored from my earliest and tenderest
years, and she loved me in all the innocence and sincerity of childhood.
Our parents were aware of our feelings, and were not sorry to perceive
them, for they saw clearly that as they ripened they must lead at last to
a marriage between us, a thing that seemed almost prearranged by the
equality of our families and wealth. We grew up, and with our growth grew
the love between us, so that the father of Luscinda felt bound for
propriety’s sake to refuse me admission to his house, in this perhaps
imitating the parents of that Thisbe so celebrated by the poets, and this
refusal but added love to love and flame to flame; for though they
enforced silence upon our tongues they could not impose it upon our pens,
which can make known the heart’s secrets to a loved one more freely than
tongues; for many a time the presence of the object of love shakes the
firmest will and strikes dumb the boldest tongue. Ah heavens! how many
letters did I write her, and how many dainty modest replies did I receive!
how many ditties and love-songs did I compose in which my heart declared
and made known its feelings, described its ardent longings, revelled in
its recollections and dallied with its desires! At length growing
impatient and feeling my heart languishing with longing to see her, I
resolved to put into execution and carry out what seemed to me the best
mode of winning my desired and merited reward, to ask her of her father
for my lawful wife, which I did. To this his answer was that he thanked me
for the disposition I showed to do honour to him and to regard myself as
honoured by the bestowal of his treasure; but that as my father was alive
it was his by right to make this demand, for if it were not in accordance
with his full will and pleasure, Luscinda was not to be taken or given by
stealth. I thanked him for his kindness, reflecting that there was reason
in what he said, and that my father would assent to it as soon as I should
tell him, and with that view I went the very same instant to let him know
what my desires were. When I entered the room where he was I found him
with an open letter in his hand, which, before I could utter a word, he
gave me, saying, ‘By this letter thou wilt see, Cardenio, the disposition
the Duke Ricardo has to serve thee.’ This Duke Ricardo, as you, sirs,
probably know already, is a grandee of Spain who has his seat in the best
part of this Andalusia. I took and read the letter, which was couched in
terms so flattering that even I myself felt it would be wrong in my father
not to comply with the request the duke made in it, which was that he
would send me immediately to him, as he wished me to become the companion,
not servant, of his eldest son, and would take upon himself the charge of
placing me in a position corresponding to the esteem in which he held me.
On reading the letter my voice failed me, and still more when I heard my
father say, ‘Two days hence thou wilt depart, Cardenio, in accordance with
the duke’s wish, and give thanks to God who is opening a road to thee by
which thou mayest attain what I know thou dost deserve; and to these words
he added others of fatherly counsel. The time for my departure arrived; I
spoke one night to Luscinda, I told her all that had occurred, as I did
also to her father, entreating him to allow some delay, and to defer the
disposal of her hand until I should see what the Duke Ricardo sought of
me: he gave me the promise, and she confirmed it with vows and swoonings
unnumbered. Finally, I presented myself to the duke, and was received and
treated by him so kindly that very soon envy began to do its work, the old
servants growing envious of me, and regarding the duke’s inclination to
show me favour as an injury to themselves. But the one to whom my arrival
gave the greatest pleasure was the duke’s second son, Fernando by name, a
gallant youth, of noble, generous, and amorous disposition, who very soon
made so intimate a friend of me that it was remarked by everybody; for
though the elder was attached to me, and showed me kindness, he did not
carry his affectionate treatment to the same length as Don Fernando. It so
happened, then, that as between friends no secret remains unshared, and as
the favour I enjoyed with Don Fernando had grown into friendship, he made
all his thoughts known to me, and in particular a love affair which
troubled his mind a little. He was deeply in love with a peasant girl, a
vassal of his father’s, the daughter of wealthy parents, and herself so
beautiful, modest, discreet, and virtuous, that no one who knew her was
able to decide in which of these respects she was most highly gifted or
most excelled. The attractions of the fair peasant raised the passion of
Don Fernando to such a point that, in order to gain his object and
overcome her virtuous resolutions, he determined to pledge his word to her
to become her husband, for to attempt it in any other way was to attempt
an impossibility. Bound to him as I was by friendship, I strove by the
best arguments and the most forcible examples I could think of to restrain
and dissuade him from such a course; but perceiving I produced no effect I
resolved to make the Duke Ricardo, his father, acquainted with the matter;
but Don Fernando, being sharp-witted and shrewd, foresaw and apprehended
this, perceiving that by my duty as a good servant I was bound not to keep
concealed a thing so much opposed to the honour of my lord the duke; and
so, to mislead and deceive me, he told me he could find no better way of
effacing from his mind the beauty that so enslaved him than by absenting
himself for some months, and that he wished the absence to be effected by
our going, both of us, to my father’s house under the pretence, which he
would make to the duke, of going to see and buy some fine horses that
there were in my city, which produces the best in the world. When I heard
him say so, even if his resolution had not been so good a one I should
have hailed it as one of the happiest that could be imagined, prompted by
my affection, seeing what a favourable chance and opportunity it offered
me of returning to see my Luscinda. With this thought and wish I commended
his idea and encouraged his design, advising him to put it into execution
as quickly as possible, as, in truth, absence produced its effect in spite
of the most deeply rooted feelings. But, as afterwards appeared, when he
said this to me he had already enjoyed the peasant girl under the title of
husband, and was waiting for an opportunity of making it known with safety
to himself, being in dread of what his father the duke would do when he
came to know of his folly. It happened, then, that as with young men love
is for the most part nothing more than appetite, which, as its final
object is enjoyment, comes to an end on obtaining it, and that which
seemed to be love takes to flight, as it cannot pass the limit fixed by
nature, which fixes no limit to true love—what I mean is that after
Don Fernando had enjoyed this peasant girl his passion subsided and his
eagerness cooled, and if at first he feigned a wish to absent himself in
order to cure his love, he was now in reality anxious to go to avoid
keeping his promise.
</p>
<p>
“The duke gave him permission, and ordered me to accompany him; we arrived
at my city, and my father gave him the reception due to his rank; I saw
Luscinda without delay, and, though it had not been dead or deadened, my
love gathered fresh life. To my sorrow I told the story of it to Don
Fernando, for I thought that in virtue of the great friendship he bore me
I was bound to conceal nothing from him. I extolled her beauty, her
gaiety, her wit, so warmly, that my praises excited in him a desire to see
a damsel adorned by such attractions. To my misfortune I yielded to it,
showing her to him one night by the light of a taper at a window where we
used to talk to one another. As she appeared to him in her dressing-gown,
she drove all the beauties he had seen until then out of his recollection;
speech failed him, his head turned, he was spell-bound, and in the end
love-smitten, as you will see in the course of the story of my misfortune;
and to inflame still further his passion, which he hid from me and
revealed to Heaven alone, it so happened that one day he found a note of
hers entreating me to demand her of her father in marriage, so delicate,
so modest, and so tender, that on reading it he told me that in Luscinda
alone were combined all the charms of beauty and understanding that were
distributed among all the other women in the world. It is true, and I own
it now, that though I knew what good cause Don Fernando had to praise
Luscinda, it gave me uneasiness to hear these praises from his mouth, and
I began to fear, and with reason to feel distrust of him, for there was no
moment when he was not ready to talk of Luscinda, and he would start the
subject himself even though he dragged it in unseasonably, a circumstance
that aroused in me a certain amount of jealousy; not that I feared any
change in the constancy or faith of Luscinda; but still my fate led me to
forebode what she assured me against. Don Fernando contrived always to
read the letters I sent to Luscinda and her answers to me, under the
pretence that he enjoyed the wit and sense of both. It so happened, then,
that Luscinda having begged of me a book of chivalry to read, one that she
was very fond of, Amadis of Gaul—”
</p>
<p>
Don Quixote no sooner heard a book of chivalry mentioned, than he said:
</p>
<p>
“Had your worship told me at the beginning of your story that the Lady
Luscinda was fond of books of chivalry, no other laudation would have been
requisite to impress upon me the superiority of her understanding, for it
could not have been of the excellence you describe had a taste for such
delightful reading been wanting; so, as far as I am concerned, you need
waste no more words in describing her beauty, worth, and intelligence;
for, on merely hearing what her taste was, I declare her to be the most
beautiful and the most intelligent woman in the world; and I wish your
worship had, along with Amadis of Gaul, sent her the worthy Don Rugel of
Greece, for I know the Lady Luscinda would greatly relish Daraida and
Garaya, and the shrewd sayings of the shepherd Darinel, and the admirable
verses of his bucolics, sung and delivered by him with such sprightliness,
wit, and ease; but a time may come when this omission can be remedied, and
to rectify it nothing more is needed than for your worship to be so good
as to come with me to my village, for there I can give you more than three
hundred books which are the delight of my soul and the entertainment of my
life;—though it occurs to me that I have not got one of them now,
thanks to the spite of wicked and envious enchanters;—but pardon me
for having broken the promise we made not to interrupt your discourse; for
when I hear chivalry or knights-errant mentioned, I can no more help
talking about them than the rays of the sun can help giving heat, or those
of the moon moisture; pardon me, therefore, and proceed, for that is more
to the purpose now.”
</p>
<p>
While Don Quixote was saying this, Cardenio allowed his head to fall upon
his breast, and seemed plunged in deep thought; and though twice Don
Quixote bade him go on with his story, he neither looked up nor uttered a
word in reply; but after some time he raised his head and said, “I cannot
get rid of the idea, nor will anyone in the world remove it, or make me
think otherwise—and he would be a blockhead who would hold or
believe anything else than that that arrant knave Master Elisabad made
free with Queen Madasima.”
</p>
<p>
“That is not true, by all that’s good,” said Don Quixote in high wrath,
turning upon him angrily, as his way was; “and it is a very great slander,
or rather villainy. Queen Madasima was a very illustrious lady, and it is
not to be supposed that so exalted a princess would have made free with a
quack; and whoever maintains the contrary lies like a great scoundrel, and
I will give him to know it, on foot or on horseback, armed or unarmed, by
night or by day, or as he likes best.”
</p>
<p>
Cardenio was looking at him steadily, and his mad fit having now come upon
him, he had no disposition to go on with his story, nor would Don Quixote
have listened to it, so much had what he had heard about Madasima
disgusted him. Strange to say, he stood up for her as if she were in
earnest his veritable born lady; to such a pass had his unholy books
brought him. Cardenio, then, being, as I said, now mad, when he heard
himself given the lie, and called a scoundrel and other insulting names,
not relishing the jest, snatched up a stone that he found near him, and
with it delivered such a blow on Don Quixote’s breast that he laid him on
his back. Sancho Panza, seeing his master treated in this fashion,
attacked the madman with his closed fist; but the Ragged One received him
in such a way that with a blow of his fist he stretched him at his feet,
and then mounting upon him crushed his ribs to his own satisfaction; the
goatherd, who came to the rescue, shared the same fate; and having beaten
and pummelled them all he left them and quietly withdrew to his
hiding-place on the mountain. Sancho rose, and with the rage he felt at
finding himself so belaboured without deserving it, ran to take vengeance
on the goatherd, accusing him of not giving them warning that this man was
at times taken with a mad fit, for if they had known it they would have
been on their guard to protect themselves. The goatherd replied that he
had said so, and that if he had not heard him, that was no fault of his.
Sancho retorted, and the goatherd rejoined, and the altercation ended in
their seizing each other by the beard, and exchanging such fisticuffs that
if Don Quixote had not made peace between them, they would have knocked
one another to pieces.
</p>
<p>
“Leave me alone, Sir Knight of the Rueful Countenance,” said Sancho,
grappling with the goatherd, “for of this fellow, who is a clown like
myself, and no dubbed knight, I can safely take satisfaction for the
affront he has offered me, fighting with him hand to hand like an honest
man.”
</p>
<p>
“That is true,” said Don Quixote, “but I know that he is not to blame for
what has happened.”
</p>
<p>
With this he pacified them, and again asked the goatherd if it would be
possible to find Cardenio, as he felt the greatest anxiety to know the end
of his story. The goatherd told him, as he had told him before, that there
was no knowing of a certainty where his lair was; but that if he wandered
about much in that neighbourhood he could not fail to fall in with him
either in or out of his senses.

<p>
Don Quixote took leave of the goatherd, and once more mounting Rocinante
bade Sancho follow him, which he having no ass, did very discontentedly.
They proceeded slowly, making their way into the most rugged part of the
mountain, Sancho all the while dying to have a talk with his master, and
longing for him to begin, so that there should be no breach of the
injunction laid upon him; but unable to keep silence so long he said to
him:
</p>
<p>
“Señor Don Quixote, give me your worship’s blessing and dismissal, for I’d
like to go home at once to my wife and children with whom I can at any
rate talk and converse as much as I like; for to want me to go through
these solitudes day and night and not speak to you when I have a mind is
burying me alive. If luck would have it that animals spoke as they did in
the days of Guisopete, it would not be so bad, because I could talk to
Rocinante about whatever came into my head, and so put up with my
ill-fortune; but it is a hard case, and not to be borne with patience, to
go seeking adventures all one’s life and get nothing but kicks and
blanketings, brickbats and punches, and with all this to have to sew up
one’s mouth without daring to say what is in one’s heart, just as if one
were dumb.”
</p>
<p>
“I understand thee, Sancho,” replied Don Quixote; “thou art dying to have
the interdict I placed upon thy tongue removed; consider it removed, and
say what thou wilt while we are wandering in these mountains.”
</p>
<p>
“So be it,” said Sancho; “let me speak now, for God knows what will happen
by-and-by; and to take advantage of the permit at once, I ask, what made
your worship stand up so for that Queen Majimasa, or whatever her name is,
or what did it matter whether that abbot was a friend of hers or not? for
if your worship had let that pass—and you were not a judge in the
matter—it is my belief the madman would have gone on with his story,
and the blow of the stone, and the kicks, and more than half a dozen cuffs
would have been escaped.”
</p>
<p>
“In faith, Sancho,” answered Don Quixote, “if thou knewest as I do what an
honourable and illustrious lady Queen Madasima was, I know thou wouldst
say I had great patience that I did not break in pieces the mouth that
uttered such blasphemies, for a very great blasphemy it is to say or
imagine that a queen has made free with a surgeon. The truth of the story
is that that Master Elisabad whom the madman mentioned was a man of great
prudence and sound judgment, and served as governor and physician to the
queen, but to suppose that she was his mistress is nonsense deserving very
severe punishment; and as a proof that Cardenio did not know what he was
saying, remember when he said it he was out of his wits.”
</p>
<p>
“That is what I say,” said Sancho; “there was no occasion for minding the
words of a madman; for if good luck had not helped your worship, and he
had sent that stone at your head instead of at your breast, a fine way we
should have been in for standing up for my lady yonder, God confound her!
And then, would not Cardenio have gone free as a madman?”
</p>
<p>
“Against men in their senses or against madmen,” said Don Quixote, “every
knight-errant is bound to stand up for the honour of women, whoever they
may be, much more for queens of such high degree and dignity as Queen
Madasima, for whom I have a particular regard on account of her amiable
qualities; for, besides being extremely beautiful, she was very wise, and
very patient under her misfortunes, of which she had many; and the counsel
and society of the Master Elisabad were a great help and support to her in
enduring her afflictions with wisdom and resignation; hence the ignorant
and ill-disposed vulgar took occasion to say and think that she was his
mistress; and they lie, I say it once more, and will lie two hundred times
more, all who think and say so.”
</p>
<p>
“I neither say nor think so,” said Sancho; “let them look to
it; with their bread let them eat it; they have rendered account to God whether
they misbehaved or not; I come from my vineyard, I know nothing; I am not fond
of prying into other men’s lives; he who buys and lies feels it in his
purse; moreover, naked was I born, naked I find myself, I neither lose nor
gain; but if they did, what is that to me? many think there are flitches where
there are no hooks; but who can put gates to the open plain? moreover they said
of God—”
</p>
<p>
“God bless me,” said Don Quixote, “what a set of absurdities thou art
stringing together! What has what we are talking about got to do with the
proverbs thou art threading one after the other? for God’s sake hold thy
tongue, Sancho, and henceforward keep to prodding thy ass and don’t meddle
in what does not concern thee; and understand with all thy five senses
that everything I have done, am doing, or shall do, is well founded on
reason and in conformity with the rules of chivalry, for I understand them
better than all the world that profess them.”
</p>
<p>
“Señor,” replied Sancho, “is it a good rule of chivalry that we should go
astray through these mountains without path or road, looking for a madman
who when he is found will perhaps take a fancy to finish what he began,
not his story, but your worship’s head and my ribs, and end by breaking
them altogether for us?”

</p>
<p>
“Peace, I say again, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “for let me tell thee it
is not so much the desire of finding that madman that leads me into these
regions as that which I have of performing among them an achievement
wherewith I shall win eternal name and fame throughout the known world;
and it shall be such that I shall thereby set the seal on all that can
make a knight-errant perfect and famous.”
</p>
<p>
“And is it very perilous, this achievement?”
</p>
<p>
“No,” replied he of the Rueful Countenance; “though it may be in the dice
that we may throw deuce-ace instead of sixes; but all will depend on thy
diligence.”
</p>
<p>
“On my diligence!” said Sancho.
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” said Don Quixote, “for if thou dost return soon from the place
where I mean to send thee, my penance will be soon over, and my glory will
soon begin. But as it is not right to keep thee any longer in suspense,
waiting to see what comes of my words, I would have thee know, Sancho,
that the famous Amadis of Gaul was one of the most perfect knights-errant—I
am wrong to say he was one; he stood alone, the first, the only one, the
lord of all that were in the world in his time. A fig for Don Belianis,
and for all who say he equalled him in any respect, for, my oath upon it,
they are deceiving themselves! I say, too, that when a painter desires to
become famous in his art he endeavours to copy the originals of the rarest
painters that he knows; and the same rule holds good for all the most
important crafts and callings that serve to adorn a state; thus must he
who would be esteemed prudent and patient imitate Ulysses, in whose person
and labours Homer presents to us a lively picture of prudence and
patience; as Virgil, too, shows us in the person of Æneas the virtue of a
pious son and the sagacity of a brave and skilful captain; not
representing or describing them as they were, but as they ought to be, so
as to leave the example of their virtues to posterity. In the same way
Amadis was the polestar, day-star, sun of valiant and devoted knights,
whom all we who fight under the banner of love and chivalry are bound to
imitate. This, then, being so, I consider, friend Sancho, that the
knight-errant who shall imitate him most closely will come nearest to
reaching the perfection of chivalry. Now one of the instances in which
this knight most conspicuously showed his prudence, worth, valour,
endurance, fortitude, and love, was when he withdrew, rejected by the Lady
Oriana, to do penance upon the Peña Pobre, changing his name into that of
Beltenebros, a name assuredly significant and appropriate to the life
which he had voluntarily adopted. So, as it is easier for me to imitate
him in this than in cleaving giants asunder, cutting off serpents’ heads,
slaying dragons, routing armies, destroying fleets, and breaking
enchantments, and as this place is so well suited for a similar purpose, I
must not allow the opportunity to escape which now so conveniently offers
me its forelock.”
</p>
<p>
“What is it in reality,” said Sancho, “that your worship means to do in
such an out-of-the-way place as this?”
</p>
<p>
“Have I not told thee,” answered Don Quixote, “that I mean to
imitate Amadis here, playing the victim of despair, the madman, the maniac, so
as at the same time to imitate the valiant Don Roland, when at the fountain he
had evidence of the fair Angelica having disgraced herself with Medoro and
through grief thereat went mad, and plucked up trees, troubled the waters of
the clear springs, slew shepherds, destroyed flocks, burned down huts, levelled
houses, dragged mares after him, and perpetrated a hundred thousand other
outrages worthy of everlasting renown and record? And though I have no
intention of imitating Roland, or Orlando, or Rotolando (for he went by all
these names), step by step in all the mad things he did, said, and thought, I
will make a rough copy to the best of my power of all that seems to me most
essential; but perhaps I shall content myself with the simple imitation of
Amadis, who without giving way to any mischievous madness but merely to tears
and sorrow, gained as much fame as the most famous.”
</p>
<p>
“It seems to me,” said Sancho, “that the knights who behaved in this way
had provocation and cause for those follies and penances; but what cause
has your worship for going mad? What lady has rejected you, or what
evidence have you found to prove that the lady Dulcinea del Toboso has
been trifling with Moor or Christian?”
</p>
<p>
“There is the point,” replied Don Quixote, “and that is the beauty of this
business of mine; no thanks to a knight-errant for going mad when he has
cause; the thing is to turn crazy without any provocation, and let my lady
know, if I do this in the dry, what I would do in the moist; moreover I
have abundant cause in the long separation I have endured from my lady
till death, Dulcinea del Toboso; for as thou didst hear that shepherd
Ambrosio say the other day, in absence all ills are felt and feared; and
so, friend Sancho, waste no time in advising me against so rare, so happy,
and so unheard-of an imitation; mad I am, and mad I must be until thou
returnest with the answer to a letter that I mean to send by thee to my
lady Dulcinea; and if it be such as my constancy deserves, my insanity and
penance will come to an end; and if it be to the opposite effect, I shall
become mad in earnest, and, being so, I shall suffer no more; thus in
whatever way she may answer I shall escape from the struggle and
affliction in which thou wilt leave me, enjoying in my senses the boon
thou bearest me, or as a madman not feeling the evil thou bringest me. But
tell me, Sancho, hast thou got Mambrino’s helmet safe? for I saw thee take
it up from the ground when that ungrateful wretch tried to break it in
pieces but could not, by which the fineness of its temper may be seen.”
</p>
<p>
To which Sancho made answer, “By the living God, Sir Knight of the Rueful
Countenance, I cannot endure or bear with patience some of the things that
your worship says; and from them I begin to suspect that all you tell me
about chivalry, and winning kingdoms and empires, and giving islands, and
bestowing other rewards and dignities after the custom of knights-errant,
must be all made up of wind and lies, and all pigments or figments, or
whatever we may call them; for what would anyone think that heard your
worship calling a barber’s basin Mambrino’s helmet without ever seeing the
mistake all this time, but that one who says and maintains such things
must have his brains addled? I have the basin in my sack all dinted, and I
am taking it home to have it mended, to trim my beard in it, if, by God’s
grace, I am allowed to see my wife and children some day or other.”
</p>
<p>
“Look here, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “by him thou didst swear by just
now I swear thou hast the most limited understanding that any squire in
the world has or ever had. Is it possible that all this time thou hast
been going about with me thou hast never found out that all things
belonging to knights-errant seem to be illusions and nonsense and ravings,
and to go always by contraries? And not because it really is so, but
because there is always a swarm of enchanters in attendance upon us that
change and alter everything with us, and turn things as they please, and
according as they are disposed to aid or destroy us; thus what seems to
thee a barber’s basin seems to me Mambrino’s helmet, and to another it
will seem something else; and rare foresight it was in the sage who is on
my side to make what is really and truly Mambrino’s helmet seem a basin to
everybody, for, being held in such estimation as it is, all the world
would pursue me to rob me of it; but when they see it is only a barber’s
basin they do not take the trouble to obtain it; as was plainly shown by
him who tried to break it, and left it on the ground without taking it,
for, by my faith, had he known it he would never have left it behind. Keep
it safe, my friend, for just now I have no need of it; indeed, I shall
have to take off all this armour and remain as naked as I was born, if I
have a mind to follow Roland rather than Amadis in my penance.”
</p>
<p>
Thus talking they reached the foot of a high mountain which stood like an
isolated peak among the others that surrounded it. Past its base there
flowed a gentle brook, all around it spread a meadow so green and
luxuriant that it was a delight to the eyes to look upon it, and forest
trees in abundance, and shrubs and flowers, added to the charms of the
spot. Upon this place the Knight of the Rueful Countenance fixed his
choice for the performance of his penance, and as he beheld it exclaimed
in a loud voice as though he were out of his senses:
</p>
<p>
“This is the place, oh, ye heavens, that I select and choose for bewailing
the misfortune in which ye yourselves have plunged me: this is the spot
where the overflowings of mine eyes shall swell the waters of yon little
brook, and my deep and endless sighs shall stir unceasingly the leaves of
these mountain trees, in testimony and token of the pain my persecuted
heart is suffering. Oh, ye rural deities, whoever ye be that haunt this
lone spot, give ear to the complaint of a wretched lover whom long absence
and brooding jealousy have driven to bewail his fate among these wilds and
complain of the hard heart of that fair and ungrateful one, the end and
limit of all human beauty! Oh, ye wood nymphs and dryads, that dwell in
the thickets of the forest, so may the nimble wanton satyrs by whom ye are
vainly wooed never disturb your sweet repose, help me to lament my hard
fate or at least weary not at listening to it! Oh, Dulcinea del Toboso,
day of my night, glory of my pain, guide of my path, star of my fortune,
so may Heaven grant thee in full all thou seekest of it, bethink thee of
the place and condition to which absence from thee has brought me, and
make that return in kindness that is due to my fidelity! Oh, lonely trees,
that from this day forward shall bear me company in my solitude, give me
some sign by the gentle movement of your boughs that my presence is not
distasteful to you! Oh, thou, my squire, pleasant companion in my
prosperous and adverse fortunes, fix well in thy memory what thou shalt
see me do here, so that thou mayest relate and report it to the sole cause
of all,” and so saying he dismounted from Rocinante, and in an instant
relieved him of saddle and bridle, and giving him a slap on the croup,
said, “He gives thee freedom who is bereft of it himself, oh steed as
excellent in deed as thou art unfortunate in thy lot; begone where thou
wilt, for thou bearest written on thy forehead that neither Astolfo’s
hippogriff, nor the famed Frontino that cost Bradamante so dear, could
equal thee in speed.”
</p>
<p>
Seeing this Sancho said, “Good luck to him who has saved us the trouble of
stripping the pack-saddle off Dapple! By my faith he would not have gone
without a slap on the croup and something said in his praise; though if he
were here I would not let anyone strip him, for there would be no
occasion, as he had nothing of the lover or victim of despair about him,
inasmuch as his master, which I was while it was God’s pleasure, was
nothing of the sort; and indeed, Sir Knight of the Rueful Countenance, if
my departure and your worship’s madness are to come off in earnest, it
will be as well to saddle Rocinante again in order that he may supply the
want of Dapple, because it will save me time in going and returning: for
if I go on foot I don’t know when I shall get there or when I shall get
back, as I am, in truth, a bad walker.”
</p>
<p>
“I declare, Sancho,” returned Don Quixote, “it shall be as thou wilt, for
thy plan does not seem to me a bad one, and three days hence thou wilt
depart, for I wish thee to observe in the meantime what I do and say for
her sake, that thou mayest be able to tell it.”
</p>
<p>
“But what more have I to see besides what I have seen?” said Sancho.
</p>
<p>
“Much thou knowest about it!” said Don Quixote. “I have now got to tear up
my garments, to scatter about my armour, knock my head against these
rocks, and more of the same sort of thing, which thou must witness.”
</p>
<p>
“For the love of God,” said Sancho, “be careful, your worship, how you
give yourself those knocks on the head, for you may come across such a
rock, and in such a way, that the very first may put an end to the whole
contrivance of this penance; and I should think, if indeed knocks on the
head seem necessary to you, and this business cannot be done without them,
you might be content—as the whole thing is feigned, and counterfeit,
and in joke—you might be content, I say, with giving them to
yourself in the water, or against something soft, like cotton; and leave
it all to me; for I’ll tell my lady that your worship knocked your head
against a point of rock harder than a diamond.”
</p>
<p>
“I thank thee for thy good intentions, friend Sancho,” answered Don
Quixote, “but I would have thee know that all these things I am doing are
not in joke, but very much in earnest, for anything else would be a
transgression of the ordinances of chivalry, which forbid us to tell any
lie whatever under the penalties due to apostasy; and to do one thing
instead of another is just the same as lying; so my knocks on the head
must be real, solid, and valid, without anything sophisticated or fanciful
about them, and it will be needful to leave me some lint to dress my
wounds, since fortune has compelled us to do without the balsam we lost.”
</p>
<p>
“It was worse losing the ass,” replied Sancho, “for with him lint and all
were lost; but I beg of your worship not to remind me again of that
accursed liquor, for my soul, not to say my stomach, turns at hearing the
very name of it; and I beg of you, too, to reckon as past the three days
you allowed me for seeing the mad things you do, for I take them as seen
already and pronounced upon, and I will tell wonderful stories to my lady;
so write the letter and send me off at once, for I long to return and take
your worship out of this purgatory where I am leaving you.”
</p>
<p>
“Purgatory dost thou call it, Sancho?” said Don Quixote, “rather call it
hell, or even worse if there be anything worse.”
</p>
<p>
“For one who is in hell,” said Sancho, “<i>nulla est
retentio</i>, as I have heard say.”
</p>
<p>
“I do not understand what <i>retentio</i> means,” said Don Quixote.
</p>
<p>
“<i>Retentio</i>,” answered Sancho, “means that whoever is in hell never comes
nor can come out of it, which will be the opposite case with your worship
or my legs will be idle, that is if I have spurs to enliven Rocinante: let
me once get to El Toboso and into the presence of my lady Dulcinea, and I
will tell her such things of the follies and madnesses (for it is all one)
that your worship has done and is still doing, that I will manage to make
her softer than a glove though I find her harder than a cork tree; and
with her sweet and honeyed answer I will come back through the air like a
witch, and take your worship out of this purgatory that seems to be hell
but is not, as there is hope of getting out of it; which, as I have said,
those in hell have not, and I believe your worship will not say anything
to the contrary.”
</p>
<p>
“That is true,” said he of the Rueful Countenance, “but how shall we
manage to write the letter?”
</p>
<p>
“And the ass-colt order too,” added Sancho.
</p>
<p>
“All shall be included,” said Don Quixote; “and as there is no paper, it
would be well done to write it on the leaves of trees, as the ancients
did, or on tablets of wax; though that would be as hard to find just now
as paper. But it has just occurred to me how it may be conveniently and
even more than conveniently written, and that is in the notebook that
belonged to Cardenio, and thou wilt take care to have it copied on paper,
in a good hand, at the first village thou comest to where there is a
schoolmaster, or if not, any sacristan will copy it; but see thou give it
not to any notary to copy, for they write a law hand that Satan could not
make out.”
</p>
<p>
“But what is to be done about the signature?” said Sancho.
</p>
<p>
“The letters of Amadis were never signed,” said Don Quixote.
</p>
<p>
“That is all very well,” said Sancho, “but the order must needs be signed,
and if it is copied they will say the signature is false, and I shall be
left without ass-colts.”
</p>
<p>
“The order shall go signed in the same book,” said Don Quixote, “and on
seeing it my niece will make no difficulty about obeying it; as to the
loveletter thou canst put by way of signature, ‘<i>Yours till death, the
Knight of the Rueful Countenance.</i>’ And it will be no great matter if it is
in some other person’s hand, for as well as I recollect Dulcinea can
neither read nor write, nor in the whole course of her life has she seen
handwriting or letter of mine, for my love and hers have been always
platonic, not going beyond a modest look, and even that so seldom that I
can safely swear I have not seen her four times in all these twelve years
I have been loving her more than the light of these eyes that the earth
will one day devour; and perhaps even of those four times she has not once
perceived that I was looking at her: such is the retirement and seclusion
in which her father Lorenzo Corchuelo and her mother Aldonza Nogales have
brought her up.”
</p>
<p>
“So, so!” said Sancho; “Lorenzo Corchuelo’s daughter is the lady Dulcinea
del Toboso, otherwise called Aldonza Lorenzo?”
</p>
<p>
“She it is,” said Don Quixote, “and she it is that is worthy to be lady of
the whole universe.”
</p>
<p>
“I know her well,” said Sancho, “and let me tell you she can fling a
crowbar as well as the lustiest lad in all the town. Giver of all good!
but she is a brave lass, and a right and stout one, and fit to be helpmate
to any knight-errant that is or is to be, who may make her his lady: the
whoreson wench, what sting she has and what a voice! I can tell you one
day she posted herself on the top of the belfry of the village to call
some labourers of theirs that were in a ploughed field of her father’s,
and though they were better than half a league off they heard her as well
as if they were at the foot of the tower; and the best of her is that she
is not a bit prudish, for she has plenty of affability, and jokes with
everybody, and has a grin and a jest for everything. So, Sir Knight of the
Rueful Countenance, I say you not only may and ought to do mad freaks for
her sake, but you have a good right to give way to despair and hang
yourself; and no one who knows of it but will say you did well, though the
devil should take you; and I wish I were on my road already, simply to see
her, for it is many a day since I saw her, and she must be altered by this
time, for going about the fields always, and the sun and the air spoil
women’s looks greatly. But I must own the truth to your worship, Señor Don
Quixote; until now I have been under a great mistake, for I believed truly
and honestly that the lady Dulcinea must be some princess your worship was
in love with, or some person great enough to deserve the rich presents you
have sent her, such as the Biscayan and the galley slaves, and many more
no doubt, for your worship must have won many victories in the time when I
was not yet your squire. But all things considered, what good can it do
the lady Aldonza Lorenzo, I mean the lady Dulcinea del Toboso, to have the
vanquished your worship sends or will send coming to her and going down on
their knees before her? Because maybe when they came she’d be hackling
flax or threshing on the threshing floor, and they’d be ashamed to see
her, and she’d laugh, or resent the present.”
</p>
<p>
“I have before now told thee many times, Sancho,” said Don Quixote,
“that thou art a mighty great chatterer, and that with a blunt wit thou
art always striving at sharpness; but to show thee what a fool thou art and how
rational I am, I would have thee listen to a short story. Thou must know that a
certain widow, fair, young, independent, and rich, and above all free and easy,
fell in love with a sturdy strapping young lay-brother; his superior came to
know of it, and one day said to the worthy widow by way of brotherly
remonstrance, ‘I am surprised, señora, and not without good reason, that
a woman of such high standing, so fair, and so rich as you are, should have
fallen in love with such a mean, low, stupid fellow as So-and-so, when in this
house there are so many masters, graduates, and divinity students from among
whom you might choose as if they were a lot of pears, saying, ‘This one
I’ll take, that I won’t take;’ but she replied to him with
great sprightliness and candour, ‘My dear sir, you are very much
mistaken, and your ideas are very old-fashioned, if you think that I have made
a bad choice in So-and-so, fool as he seems; because for all I want with him he
knows as much and more philosophy than Aristotle.’ In the same way,
Sancho, for all I want with Dulcinea del Toboso she is just as good as the most
exalted princess on earth. It is not to be supposed that all those poets who
sang the praises of ladies under the fancy names they give them, had any such
mistresses. Thinkest thou that the Amarillises, the Phillises, the Sylvias, the
Dianas, the Galateas, the Fílidas, and all the rest of them, that the books,
the ballads, the barber’s shops, the theatres are full of, were really
and truly ladies of flesh and blood, and mistresses of those that glorify and
have glorified them? Nothing of the kind; they only invent them for the most
part to furnish a subject for their verses, and that they may pass for lovers,
or for men valiant enough to be so; and so it suffices me to think and believe
that the good Aldonza Lorenzo is fair and virtuous; and as to her pedigree it
is very little matter, for no one will examine into it for the purpose of
conferring any order upon her, and I, for my part, reckon her the most exalted
princess in the world. For thou shouldst know, Sancho, if thou dost not know,
that two things alone beyond all others are incentives to love, and these are
great beauty and a good name, and these two things are to be found in Dulcinea
in the highest degree, for in beauty no one equals her and in good name few
approach her; and to put the whole thing in a nutshell, I persuade myself that
all I say is as I say, neither more nor less, and I picture her in my
imagination as I would have her to be, as well in beauty as in condition; Helen
approaches her not nor does Lucretia come up to her, nor any other of the
famous women of times past, Greek, Barbarian, or Latin; and let each say what
he will, for if in this I am taken to task by the ignorant, I shall not be
censured by the critical.”
</p>
<p>
“I say that your worship is entirely right,” said Sancho, “and that I am
an ass. But I know not how the name of ass came into my mouth, for a rope
is not to be mentioned in the house of him who has been hanged; but now
for the letter, and then, God be with you, I am off.”
</p>
<p>
Don Quixote took out the notebook, and, retiring to one side, very
deliberately began to write the letter, and when he had finished it he
called to Sancho, saying he wished to read it to him, so that he might
commit it to memory, in case of losing it on the road; for with evil
fortune like his anything might be apprehended. To which Sancho replied,
“Write it two or three times there in the book and give it to me, and I
will carry it very carefully, because to expect me to keep it in my memory
is all nonsense, for I have such a bad one that I often forget my own
name; but for all that repeat it to me, as I shall like to hear it, for
surely it will run as if it was in print.”
</p>
<p>
“Listen,” said Don Quixote, “this is what it says:
</p>
<p class="center">
<i>“Don Quixote’s Letter to Dulcinea del Toboso</i>
</p>
<p class="letter">
“Sovereign and exalted Lady,—The pierced by the point of absence,
the wounded to the heart’s core, sends thee, sweetest Dulcinea del
Toboso, the health that he himself enjoys not. If thy beauty
despises me, if thy worth is not for me, if thy scorn is my
affliction, though I be sufficiently long-suffering, hardly shall I
endure this anxiety, which, besides being oppressive, is protracted.
My good squire Sancho will relate to thee in full, fair ingrate,
dear enemy, the condition to which I am reduced on thy account: if
it be thy pleasure to give me relief, I am thine; if not, do as may be
pleasing to thee; for by ending my life I shall satisfy thy cruelty
and my desire.<br>
    “Thine till death,<br>
    “The Knight of the Rueful Countenance.”
</p>
<p>
“By the life of my father,” said Sancho, when he heard the letter, “it is
the loftiest thing I ever heard. Body of me! how your worship says
everything as you like in it! And how well you fit in ‘The Knight of the
Rueful Countenance’ into the signature. I declare your worship is indeed
the very devil, and there is nothing you don’t know.”
</p>
<p>
“Everything is needed for the calling I follow,” said Don Quixote.
</p>
<p>
“Now then,” said Sancho, “let your worship put the order for the three
ass-colts on the other side, and sign it very plainly, that they may
recognise it at first sight.”
</p>
<p>
“With all my heart,” said Don Quixote, and as he had written it he read it
to this effect:
</p>
<p class="letter">
“Mistress Niece,—By this first of ass-colts please pay to Sancho
Panza, my squire, three of the five I left at home in your charge: said
three ass-colts to be paid and delivered for the same number received here
in hand, which upon this and upon his receipt shall be duly paid. Done in
the heart of the Sierra Morena, the twenty-seventh of August of this
present year.”
</p>
<p>
“That will do,” said Sancho; “now let your worship sign it.”
</p>
<p>
“There is no need to sign it,” said Don Quixote, “but merely to put my
flourish, which is the same as a signature, and enough for three asses, or
even three hundred.”
</p>
<p>
“I can trust your worship,” returned Sancho; “let me go and saddle
Rocinante, and be ready to give me your blessing, for I mean to go at once
without seeing the fooleries your worship is going to do; I’ll say I saw
you do so many that she will not want any more.”
</p>
<p>
“At any rate, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “I should like—and there is
reason for it—I should like thee, I say, to see me stripped to the
skin and performing a dozen or two of insanities, which I can get done in
less than half an hour; for having seen them with thine own eyes, thou
canst then safely swear to the rest that thou wouldst add; and I promise
thee thou wilt not tell of as many as I mean to perform.”
</p>
<p>
“For the love of God, master mine,” said Sancho, “let me not see your
worship stripped, for it will sorely grieve me, and I shall not be able to
keep from tears, and my head aches so with all I shed last night for
Dapple, that I am not fit to begin any fresh weeping; but if it is your
worship’s pleasure that I should see some insanities, do them in your
clothes, short ones, and such as come readiest to hand; for I myself want
nothing of the sort, and, as I have said, it will be a saving of time for
my return, which will be with the news your worship desires and deserves.
If not, let the lady Dulcinea look to it; if she does not answer
reasonably, I swear as solemnly as I can that I will fetch a fair answer
out of her stomach with kicks and cuffs; for why should it be borne that a
knight-errant as famous as your worship should go mad without rhyme or
reason for a—? Her ladyship had best not drive me to say it, for by
God I will speak out and let off everything cheap, even if it doesn’t
sell: I am pretty good at that! she little knows me; faith, if she knew me
she’d be in awe of me.”
</p>
<p>
“In faith, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “to all appearance thou art no
sounder in thy wits than I.”
</p>
<p>
“I am not so mad,” answered Sancho, “but I am more peppery; but apart from
all this, what has your worship to eat until I come back? Will you sally
out on the road like Cardenio to force it from the shepherds?”
</p>
<p>
“Let not that anxiety trouble thee,” replied Don Quixote, “for even if I
had it I should not eat anything but the herbs and the fruits which this
meadow and these trees may yield me; the beauty of this business of mine
lies in not eating, and in performing other mortifications.”
</p>
<p>
“Do you know what I am afraid of?” said Sancho upon this; “that I shall
not be able to find my way back to this spot where I am leaving you, it is
such an out-of-the-way place.”
</p>
<p>
“Observe the landmarks well,” said Don Quixote, “for I will try not to go
far from this neighbourhood, and I will even take care to mount the
highest of these rocks to see if I can discover thee returning; however,
not to miss me and lose thyself, the best plan will be to cut some
branches of the broom that is so abundant about here, and as thou goest to
lay them at intervals until thou hast come out upon the plain; these will
serve thee, after the fashion of the clue in the labyrinth of Theseus, as
marks and signs for finding me on thy return.”
</p>
<p>
“So I will,” said Sancho Panza, and having cut some, he asked his master’s
blessing, and not without many tears on both sides, took his leave of him,
and mounting Rocinante, of whom Don Quixote charged him earnestly to have
as much care as of his own person, he set out for the plain, strewing at
intervals the branches of broom as his master had recommended him; and so
he went his way, though Don Quixote still entreated him to see him do were
it only a couple of mad acts. He had not gone a hundred paces, however,
when he returned and said:
</p>
<p>
“I must say, señor, your worship said quite right, that in order to be
able to swear without a weight on my conscience that I had seen you do mad
things, it would be well for me to see if it were only one; though in your
worship’s remaining here I have seen a very great one.”

<br><br><br>
</p>
<p>
“Did I not tell thee so?” said Don Quixote. “Wait, Sancho, and I will do
them in the saying of a credo,” and pulling off his breeches in all haste
he stripped himself to his skin and his shirt, and then, without more ado,
he cut a couple of gambados in the air, and a couple of somersaults, heels
over head, making such a display that, not to see it a second time, Sancho
wheeled Rocinante round, and felt easy, and satisfied in his mind that he
could swear he had left his master mad; and so we will leave him to follow
his road until his return, which was a quick one.

<p>
Returning to the proceedings of him of the Rueful Countenance when he
found himself alone, the history says that when Don Quixote had completed
the performance of the somersaults or capers, naked from the waist down
and clothed from the waist up, and saw that Sancho had gone off without
waiting to see any more crazy feats, he climbed up to the top of a high
rock, and there set himself to consider what he had several times before
considered without ever coming to any conclusion on the point, namely
whether it would be better and more to his purpose to imitate the
outrageous madness of Roland, or the melancholy madness of Amadis; and
communing with himself he said:
</p>
<p>
“What wonder is it if Roland was so good a knight and so valiant as
everyone says he was, when, after all, he was enchanted, and nobody could
kill him save by thrusting a corking pin into the sole of his foot, and he
always wore shoes with seven iron soles? Though cunning devices did not
avail him against Bernardo del Carpio, who knew all about them, and
strangled him in his arms at Roncesvalles. But putting the question of his
valour aside, let us come to his losing his wits, for certain it is that
he did lose them in consequence of the proofs he discovered at the
fountain, and the intelligence the shepherd gave him of Angelica having
slept more than two siestas with Medoro, a little curly-headed Moor, and
page to Agramante. If he was persuaded that this was true, and that his
lady had wronged him, it is no wonder that he should have gone mad; but I,
how am I to imitate him in his madness, unless I can imitate him in the
cause of it? For my Dulcinea, I will venture to swear, never saw a Moor in
her life, as he is, in his proper costume, and she is this day as the
mother that bore her, and I should plainly be doing her a wrong if,
fancying anything else, I were to go mad with the same kind of madness as
Roland the Furious. On the other hand, I see that Amadis of Gaul, without
losing his senses and without doing anything mad, acquired as a lover as
much fame as the most famous; for, according to his history, on finding
himself rejected by his lady Oriana, who had ordered him not to appear in
her presence until it should be her pleasure, all he did was to retire to
the Peña Pobre in company with a hermit, and there he took his fill of
weeping until Heaven sent him relief in the midst of his great grief and
need. And if this be true, as it is, why should I now take the trouble to
strip stark naked, or do mischief to these trees which have done me no
harm, or why am I to disturb the clear waters of these brooks which will
give me to drink whenever I have a mind? Long live the memory of Amadis
and let him be imitated so far as is possible by Don Quixote of La Mancha,
of whom it will be said, as was said of the other, that if he did not
achieve great things, he died in attempting them; and if I am not repulsed
or rejected by my Dulcinea, it is enough for me, as I have said, to be
absent from her. And so, now to business; come to my memory ye deeds of
Amadis, and show me how I am to begin to imitate you. I know already that
what he chiefly did was to pray and commend himself to God; but what am I
to do for a rosary, for I have not got one?”
</p>
<p>
And then it occurred to him how he might make one, and that was by tearing
a great strip off the tail of his shirt which hung down, and making eleven
knots on it, one bigger than the rest, and this served him for a rosary
all the time he was there, during which he repeated countless ave-marias.
But what distressed him greatly was not having another hermit there to
confess him and receive consolation from; and so he solaced himself with
pacing up and down the little meadow, and writing and carving on the bark
of the trees and on the fine sand a multitude of verses all in harmony
with his sadness, and some in praise of Dulcinea; but, when he was found
there afterwards, the only ones completely legible that could be
discovered were those that follow here:
</p>
<p class="poem">
Ye on the mountainside that grow,<br>
Ye green things all, trees, shrubs, and bushes,<br>
Are ye aweary of the woe<br>
That this poor aching bosom crushes?<br>
If it disturb you, and I owe<br>
Some reparation, it may be a<br>
Defence for me to let you know<br>
Don Quixote’s tears are on the flow,<br>
And all for distant Dulcinea<br>
Del Toboso.<br>
<br>
The lealest lover time can show,<br>
Doomed for a lady-love to languish,<br>
Among these solitudes doth go,<br>
A prey to every kind of anguish.<br>
Why Love should like a spiteful foe<br>
Thus use him, he hath no idea,<br>
But hogsheads full—this doth he know—<br>
Don Quixote’s tears are on the flow,<br>
And all for distant Dulcinea<br>
Del Toboso.<br>
<br>
Adventure-seeking doth he go<br>
Up rugged heights, down rocky valleys,<br>
But hill or dale, or high or low,<br>
Mishap attendeth all his sallies:<br>
Love still pursues him to and fro,<br>
And plies his cruel scourge—ah me! a<br>
Relentless fate, an endless woe;<br>
Don Quixote’s tears are on the flow,<br>
And all for distant Dulcinea<br>
Del Toboso.<br>
</p>
<p>
The addition of “Del Toboso” to Dulcinea’s name gave rise to no little
laughter among those who found the above lines, for they suspected Don
Quixote must have fancied that unless he added “del Toboso” when he
introduced the name of Dulcinea the verse would be unintelligible; which
was indeed the fact, as he himself afterwards admitted. He wrote many
more, but, as has been said, these three verses were all that could be
plainly and perfectly deciphered. In this way, and in sighing and calling
on the fauns and satyrs of the woods and the nymphs of the streams, and
Echo, moist and mournful, to answer, console, and hear him, as well as in
looking for herbs to sustain him, he passed his time until Sancho’s
return; and had that been delayed three weeks, as it was three days, the
Knight of the Rueful Countenance would have worn such an altered
countenance that the mother that bore him would not have known him: and
here it will be well to leave him, wrapped up in sighs and verses, to
relate how Sancho Panza fared on his mission.
</p>
<p>
As for him, coming out upon the high road, he made for El Toboso, and the
next day reached the inn where the mishap of the blanket had befallen him.
As soon as he recognised it he felt as if he were once more living through
the air, and he could not bring himself to enter it though it was an hour
when he might well have done so, for it was dinner-time, and he longed to
taste something hot as it had been all cold fare with him for many days
past. This craving drove him to draw near to the inn, still undecided
whether to go in or not, and as he was hesitating there came out two
persons who at once recognised him, and said one to the other:
</p>
<p>
“Señor licentiate, is not he on the horse there Sancho Panza who, our
adventurer’s housekeeper told us, went off with her master as esquire?”
</p>
<p>
“So it is,” said the licentiate, “and that is our friend Don Quixote’s
horse;” and if they knew him so well it was because they were the curate
and the barber of his own village, the same who had carried out the
scrutiny and sentence upon the books; and as soon as they recognised
Sancho Panza and Rocinante, being anxious to hear of Don Quixote, they
approached, and calling him by his name the curate said, “Friend Sancho
Panza, where is your master?”
</p>
<p>
Sancho recognised them at once, and determined to keep secret the place
and circumstances where and under which he had left his master, so he
replied that his master was engaged in a certain quarter on a certain
matter of great importance to him which he could not disclose for the eyes
in his head.
</p>
<p>
“Nay, nay,” said the barber, “if you don’t tell us where he is, Sancho
Panza, we will suspect as we suspect already, that you have murdered and
robbed him, for here you are mounted on his horse; in fact, you must
produce the master of the hack, or else take the consequences.”
</p>
<p>
“There is no need of threats with me,” said Sancho, “for I am not a man to
rob or murder anybody; let his own fate, or God who made him, kill each
one; my master is engaged very much to his taste doing penance in the
midst of these mountains;” and then, offhand and without stopping, he told
them how he had left him, what adventures had befallen him, and how he was
carrying a letter to the lady Dulcinea del Toboso, the daughter of Lorenzo
Corchuelo, with whom he was over head and ears in love. They were both
amazed at what Sancho Panza told them; for though they were aware of Don
Quixote’s madness and the nature of it, each time they heard of it they
were filled with fresh wonder. They then asked Sancho Panza to show them
the letter he was carrying to the lady Dulcinea del Toboso. He said it was
written in a notebook, and that his master’s directions were that he
should have it copied on paper at the first village he came to. On this
the curate said if he showed it to him, he himself would make a fair copy
of it. Sancho put his hand into his bosom in search of the notebook but
could not find it, nor, if he had been searching until now, could he have
found it, for Don Quixote had kept it, and had never given it to him, nor
had he himself thought of asking for it. When Sancho discovered he could
not find the book his face grew deadly pale, and in great haste he again
felt his body all over, and seeing plainly it was not to be found, without
more ado he seized his beard with both hands and plucked away half of it,
and then, as quick as he could and without stopping, gave himself half a
dozen cuffs on the face and nose till they were bathed in blood.
</p>
<p>
Seeing this, the curate and the barber asked him what had happened him
that he gave himself such rough treatment.
</p>
<p>
“What should happen to me?” replied Sancho, “but to have lost from one hand
to the other, in a moment, three ass-colts, each of them like a castle?”
</p>
<p>
“How is that?” said the barber.
</p>
<p>
“I have lost the notebook,” said Sancho, “that contained the letter to
Dulcinea, and an order signed by my master in which he directed his niece
to give me three ass-colts out of four or five he had at home;” and he
then told them about the loss of Dapple.
</p>
<p>
The curate consoled him, telling him that when his master was found he
would get him to renew the order, and make a fresh draft on paper, as was
usual and customary; for those made in notebooks were never accepted or
honoured.
</p>
<p>
Sancho comforted himself with this, and said if that were so the loss of
Dulcinea’s letter did not trouble him much, for he had it almost by heart,
and it could be taken down from him wherever and whenever they liked.
</p>
<p>
“Repeat it then, Sancho,” said the barber, “and we will write it down
afterwards.”
</p>
<p>
Sancho Panza stopped to scratch his head to bring back the letter to his
memory, and balanced himself now on one foot, now the other, one moment
staring at the ground, the next at the sky, and after having half gnawed
off the end of a finger and kept them in suspense waiting for him to
begin, he said, after a long pause, “By God, señor licentiate, devil a
thing can I recollect of the letter; but it said at the beginning,
‘Exalted and scrubbing Lady.’”
</p>
<p>
“It cannot have said ‘scrubbing,’” said the barber, “but ‘superhuman’ or
‘sovereign.’”
</p>
<p>
“That is it,” said Sancho; “then, as well as I remember, it went on, ‘The
wounded, and wanting of sleep, and the pierced, kisses your worship’s
hands, ungrateful and very unrecognised fair one; and it said something or
other about health and sickness that he was sending her; and from that it
went tailing off until it ended with ‘Yours till death, the Knight of the
Rueful Countenance.’”
</p>
<p>
It gave them no little amusement, both of them, to see what a good memory
Sancho had, and they complimented him greatly upon it, and begged him to
repeat the letter a couple of times more, so that they too might get it by
heart to write it out by-and-by. Sancho repeated it three times, and as he
did, uttered three thousand more absurdities; then he told them more about
his master but he never said a word about the blanketing that had befallen
himself in that inn, into which he refused to enter. He told them,
moreover, how his lord, if he brought him a favourable answer from the
lady Dulcinea del Toboso, was to put himself in the way of endeavouring to
become an emperor, or at least a monarch; for it had been so settled
between them, and with his personal worth and the might of his arm it was
an easy matter to come to be one: and how on becoming one his lord was to
make a marriage for him (for he would be a widower by that time, as a
matter of course) and was to give him as a wife one of the damsels of the
empress, the heiress of some rich and grand state on the mainland, having
nothing to do with islands of any sort, for he did not care for them now.
All this Sancho delivered with so much composure—wiping his nose
from time to time—and with so little common-sense that his two
hearers were again filled with wonder at the force of Don Quixote’s
madness that could run away with this poor man’s reason. They did not care
to take the trouble of disabusing him of his error, as they considered
that since it did not in any way hurt his conscience it would be better to
leave him in it, and they would have all the more amusement in listening
to his simplicities; and so they bade him pray to God for his lord’s
health, as it was a very likely and a very feasible thing for him in
course of time to come to be an emperor, as he said, or at least an
archbishop or some other dignitary of equal rank.
</p>
<p>
To which Sancho made answer, “If fortune, sirs, should bring things about
in such a way that my master should have a mind, instead of being an
emperor, to be an archbishop, I should like to know what
archbishops-errant commonly give their squires?”
</p>
<p>
“They commonly give them,” said the curate, some simple benefice or cure,
or some place as sacristan which brings them a good fixed income, not
counting the altar fees, which may be reckoned at as much more.”
</p>
<p>
“But for that,” said Sancho, “the squire must be unmarried, and must know,
at any rate, how to help at mass, and if that be so, woe is me, for I am
married already and I don’t know the first letter of the A B C. What will
become of me if my master takes a fancy to be an archbishop and not an
emperor, as is usual and customary with knights-errant?”
</p>
<p>
“Be not uneasy, friend Sancho,” said the barber, “for we will entreat your
master, and advise him, even urging it upon him as a case of conscience,
to become an emperor and not an archbishop, because it will be easier for
him as he is more valiant than lettered.”
</p>
<p>
“So I have thought,” said Sancho; “though I can tell you he is fit for
anything: what I mean to do for my part is to pray to our Lord to place
him where it may be best for him, and where he may be able to bestow most
favours upon me.”
</p>
<p>
“You speak like a man of sense,” said the curate, “and you will be acting
like a good Christian; but what must now be done is to take steps to coax
your master out of that useless penance you say he is performing; and we
had best turn into this inn to consider what plan to adopt, and also to
dine, for it is now time.”
</p>
<p>
Sancho said they might go in, but that he would wait there outside, and
that he would tell them afterwards the reason why he was unwilling, and
why it did not suit him to enter it; but he begged them to bring him out
something to eat, and to let it be hot, and also to bring barley for
Rocinante. They left him and went in, and presently the barber brought him
out something to eat. By-and-by, after they had between them carefully
thought over what they should do to carry out their object, the curate hit
upon an idea very well adapted to humour Don Quixote, and effect their
purpose; and his notion, which he explained to the barber, was that he
himself should assume the disguise of a wandering damsel, while the other
should try as best he could to pass for a squire, and that they should
thus proceed to where Don Quixote was, and he, pretending to be an
aggrieved and distressed damsel, should ask a favour of him, which as a
valiant knight-errant he could not refuse to grant; and the favour he
meant to ask him was that he should accompany her whither she would
conduct him, in order to redress a wrong which a wicked knight had done
her, while at the same time she should entreat him not to require her to
remove her mask, nor ask her any question touching her circumstances until
he had righted her with the wicked knight. And he had no doubt that Don
Quixote would comply with any request made in these terms, and that in
this way they might remove him and take him to his own village, where they
would endeavour to find out if his extraordinary madness admitted of any
kind of remedy.

OF HOW THE CURATE AND THE BARBER PROCEEDED WITH THEIR SCHEME; TOGETHER

<p>
The curate’s plan did not seem a bad one to the barber, but on the
contrary so good that they immediately set about putting it in execution.
They begged a petticoat and hood of the landlady, leaving her in pledge a
new cassock of the curate’s; and the barber made a beard out of a
grey-brown or red ox-tail in which the landlord used to stick his comb.
The landlady asked them what they wanted these things for, and the curate
told her in a few words about the madness of Don Quixote, and how this
disguise was intended to get him away from the mountain where he then was.
The landlord and landlady immediately came to the conclusion that the
madman was their guest, the balsam man and master of the blanketed squire,
and they told the curate all that had passed between him and them, not
omitting what Sancho had been so silent about. Finally the landlady
dressed up the curate in a style that left nothing to be desired; she put
on him a cloth petticoat with black velvet stripes a palm broad, all
slashed, and a bodice of green velvet set off by a binding of white satin,
which as well as the petticoat must have been made in the time of king
Wamba. The curate would not let them hood him, but put on his head a
little quilted linen cap which he used for a night-cap, and bound his
forehead with a strip of black silk, while with another he made a mask
with which he concealed his beard and face very well. He then put on his
hat, which was broad enough to serve him for an umbrella, and enveloping
himself in his cloak seated himself woman-fashion on his mule, while the
barber mounted his with a beard down to the waist of mingled red and
white, for it was, as has been said, the tail of a clay-red ox.
</p>
<p>
They took leave of all, and of the good Maritornes, who, sinner as she
was, promised to pray a rosary of prayers that God might grant them
success in such an arduous and Christian undertaking as that they had in
hand. But hardly had he sallied forth from the inn when it struck the
curate that he was doing wrong in rigging himself out in that fashion, as
it was an indecorous thing for a priest to dress himself that way even
though much might depend upon it; and saying so to the barber he begged
him to change dresses, as it was fitter he should be the distressed
damsel, while he himself would play the squire’s part, which would be less
derogatory to his dignity; otherwise he was resolved to have nothing more
to do with the matter, and let the devil take Don Quixote. Just at this
moment Sancho came up, and on seeing the pair in such a costume he was
unable to restrain his laughter; the barber, however, agreed to do as the
curate wished, and, altering their plan, the curate went on to instruct
him how to play his part and what to say to Don Quixote to induce and
compel him to come with them and give up his fancy for the place he had
chosen for his idle penance. The barber told him he could manage it
properly without any instruction, and as he did not care to dress himself
up until they were near where Don Quixote was, he folded up the garments,
and the curate adjusted his beard, and they set out under the guidance of
Sancho Panza, who went along telling them of the encounter with the madman
they met in the Sierra, saying nothing, however, about the finding of the
valise and its contents; for with all his simplicity the lad was a trifle
covetous.
</p>
<p>
The next day they reached the place where Sancho had laid the
broom-branches as marks to direct him to where he had left his master, and
recognising it he told them that here was the entrance, and that they
would do well to dress themselves, if that was required to deliver his
master; for they had already told him that going in this guise and
dressing in this way were of the highest importance in order to rescue his
master from the pernicious life he had adopted; and they charged him
strictly not to tell his master who they were, or that he knew them, and
should he ask, as ask he would, if he had given the letter to Dulcinea, to
say that he had, and that, as she did not know how to read, she had given
an answer by word of mouth, saying that she commanded him, on pain of her
displeasure, to come and see her at once; and it was a very important
matter for himself, because in this way and with what they meant to say to
him they felt sure of bringing him back to a better mode of life and
inducing him to take immediate steps to become an emperor or monarch, for
there was no fear of his becoming an archbishop. All this Sancho listened
to and fixed it well in his memory, and thanked them heartily for
intending to recommend his master to be an emperor instead of an
archbishop, for he felt sure that in the way of bestowing rewards on their
squires emperors could do more than archbishops-errant. He said, too, that
it would be as well for him to go on before them to find him, and give him
his lady’s answer; for that perhaps might be enough to bring him away from
the place without putting them to all this trouble. They approved of what
Sancho proposed, and resolved to wait for him until he brought back word
of having found his master.
</p>
<p>
Sancho pushed on into the glens of the Sierra, leaving them in one through
which there flowed a little gentle rivulet, and where the rocks and trees
afforded a cool and grateful shade. It was an August day with all the heat
of one, and the heat in those parts is intense, and the hour was three in
the afternoon, all which made the spot the more inviting and tempted them
to wait there for Sancho’s return, which they did. They were reposing,
then, in the shade, when a voice unaccompanied by the notes of any
instrument, but sweet and pleasing in its tone, reached their ears, at
which they were not a little astonished, as the place did not seem to them
likely quarters for one who sang so well; for though it is often said that
shepherds of rare voice are to be found in the woods and fields, this is
rather a flight of the poet’s fancy than the truth. And still more
surprised were they when they perceived that what they heard sung were the
verses not of rustic shepherds, but of the polished wits of the city; and
so it proved, for the verses they heard were these:
</p>
<p class="poem">
What makes my quest of happiness seem vain?<br>
Disdain.<br>
What bids me to abandon hope of ease?<br>
Jealousies.<br>
What holds my heart in anguish of suspense?<br>
Absence.<br>
If that be so, then for my grief<br>
Where shall I turn to seek relief,<br>
When hope on every side lies slain<br>
By Absence, Jealousies, Disdain?<br>
<br>
What the prime cause of all my woe doth prove?<br>
Love.<br>
What at my glory ever looks askance?<br>
Chance.<br>
Whence is permission to afflict me given?<br>
Heaven.<br>
If that be so, I but await<br>
The stroke of a resistless fate,<br>
Since, working for my woe, these three,<br>
Love, Chance and Heaven, in league I see.<br>
<br>
What must I do to find a remedy?<br>
Die.<br>
What is the lure for love when coy and strange?<br>
Change.<br>
What, if all fail, will cure the heart of sadness?<br>
Madness.<br>
If that be so, it is but folly<br>
To seek a cure for melancholy:<br>
Ask where it lies; the answer saith<br>
In Change, in Madness, or in Death.<br>
</p>
<p>
The hour, the summer season, the solitary place, the voice and skill of
the singer, all contributed to the wonder and delight of the two
listeners, who remained still waiting to hear something more; finding,
however, that the silence continued some little time, they resolved to go
in search of the musician who sang with so fine a voice; but just as they
were about to do so they were checked by the same voice, which once more
fell upon their ears, singing this
</p>
<p class="poem">
SONNET<br>
<br>
When heavenward, holy Friendship, thou didst go<br>
Soaring to seek thy home beyond the sky,<br>
And take thy seat among the saints on high,<br>
It was thy will to leave on earth below<br>
Thy semblance, and upon it to bestow<br>
Thy veil, wherewith at times hypocrisy,<br>
Parading in thy shape, deceives the eye,<br>
And makes its vileness bright as virtue show.<br>
Friendship, return to us, or force the cheat<br>
That wears it now, thy livery to restore,<br>
By aid whereof sincerity is slain.<br>
If thou wilt not unmask thy counterfeit,<br>
This earth will be the prey of strife once more,<br>
As when primæval discord held its reign.<br>
</p>
<p>
The song ended with a deep sigh, and again the listeners remained waiting
attentively for the singer to resume; but perceiving that the music had
now turned to sobs and heart-rending moans they determined to find out who
the unhappy being could be whose voice was as rare as his sighs were
piteous, and they had not proceeded far when on turning the corner of a
rock they discovered a man of the same aspect and appearance as Sancho had
described to them when he told them the story of Cardenio. He, showing no
astonishment when he saw them, stood still with his head bent down upon
his breast like one in deep thought, without raising his eyes to look at
them after the first glance when they suddenly came upon him. The curate,
who was aware of his misfortune and recognised him by the description,
being a man of good address, approached him and in a few sensible words
entreated and urged him to quit a life of such misery, lest he should end
it there, which would be the greatest of all misfortunes. Cardenio was
then in his right mind, free from any attack of that madness which so
frequently carried him away, and seeing them dressed in a fashion so
unusual among the frequenters of those wilds, could not help showing some
surprise, especially when he heard them speak of his case as if it were a
well-known matter (for the curate’s words gave him to understand as much)
so he replied to them thus:
</p>
<p>
“I see plainly, sirs, whoever you may be, that Heaven, whose care it is to
succour the good, and even the wicked very often, here, in this remote
spot, cut off from human intercourse, sends me, though I deserve it not,
those who seek to draw me away from this to some better retreat, showing
me by many and forcible arguments how unreasonably I act in leading the
life I do; but as they know, that if I escape from this evil I shall fall
into another still greater, perhaps they will set me down as a weak-minded
man, or, what is worse, one devoid of reason; nor would it be any wonder,
for I myself can perceive that the effect of the recollection of my
misfortunes is so great and works so powerfully to my ruin, that in spite
of myself I become at times like a stone, without feeling or
consciousness; and I come to feel the truth of it when they tell me and
show me proofs of the things I have done when the terrible fit overmasters
me; and all I can do is bewail my lot in vain, and idly curse my destiny,
and plead for my madness by telling how it was caused, to any that care to
hear it; for no reasonable beings on learning the cause will wonder at the
effects; and if they cannot help me at least they will not blame me, and
the repugnance they feel at my wild ways will turn into pity for my woes.
If it be, sirs, that you are here with the same design as others have come
with, before you proceed with your wise arguments, I entreat you to hear
the story of my countless misfortunes, for perhaps when you have heard it
you will spare yourselves the trouble you would take in offering
consolation to grief that is beyond the reach of it.”
</p>
<p>
As they, both of them, desired nothing more than to hear from his own lips
the cause of his suffering, they entreated him to tell it, promising not
to do anything for his relief or comfort that he did not wish; and
thereupon the unhappy gentleman began his sad story in nearly the same
words and manner in which he had related it to Don Quixote and the
goatherd a few days before, when, through Master Elisabad, and Don
Quixote’s scrupulous observance of what was due to chivalry, the tale was
left unfinished, as this history has already recorded; but now fortunately
the mad fit kept off, allowed him to tell it to the end; and so, coming to
the incident of the note which Don Fernando had found in the volume of
“Amadis of Gaul,” Cardenio said that he remembered it perfectly and that
it was in these words:
</p>
<p class="center">
“<i>Luscinda to Cardenio.</i>
</p>
<p class="letter">
“Every day I discover merits in you that oblige and compel me to hold you
in higher estimation; so if you desire to relieve me of this obligation without
cost to my honour, you may easily do so. I have a father who knows you and
loves me dearly, who without putting any constraint on my inclination will
grant what will be reasonable for you to have, if it be that you value me as
you say and as I believe you do.”
</p>
<p>
“By this letter I was induced, as I told you, to demand Luscinda for my
wife, and it was through it that Luscinda came to be regarded by Don
Fernando as one of the most discreet and prudent women of the day, and
this letter it was that suggested his design of ruining me before mine
could be carried into effect. I told Don Fernando that all Luscinda’s
father was waiting for was that mine should ask her of him, which I did
not dare to suggest to him, fearing that he would not consent to do so;
not because he did not know perfectly well the rank, goodness, virtue, and
beauty of Luscinda, and that she had qualities that would do honour to any
family in Spain, but because I was aware that he did not wish me to marry
so soon, before seeing what the Duke Ricardo would do for me. In short, I
told him I did not venture to mention it to my father, as well on account
of that difficulty, as of many others that discouraged me though I knew
not well what they were, only that it seemed to me that what I desired was
never to come to pass. To all this Don Fernando answered that he would
take it upon himself to speak to my father, and persuade him to speak to
Luscinda’s father. O, ambitious Marius! O, cruel Catiline! O, wicked
Sylla! O, perfidious Ganelon! O, treacherous Vellido! O, vindictive
Julian! O, covetous Judas! Traitor, cruel, vindictive, and perfidious,
wherein had this poor wretch failed in his fidelity, who with such
frankness showed thee the secrets and the joys of his heart? What offence
did I commit? What words did I utter, or what counsels did I give that had
not the furtherance of thy honour and welfare for their aim? But, woe is
me, wherefore do I complain? for sure it is that when misfortunes spring
from the stars, descending from on high they fall upon us with such fury
and violence that no power on earth can check their course nor human
device stay their coming. Who could have thought that Don Fernando, a
highborn gentleman, intelligent, bound to me by gratitude for my services,
one that could win the object of his love wherever he might set his
affections, could have become so obdurate, as they say, as to rob me of my
one ewe lamb that was not even yet in my possession? But laying aside
these useless and unavailing reflections, let us take up the broken thread
of my unhappy story.
</p>
<p>
“To proceed, then: Don Fernando finding my presence an obstacle to the
execution of his treacherous and wicked design, resolved to send me to his
elder brother under the pretext of asking money from him to pay for six
horses which, purposely, and with the sole object of sending me away that
he might the better carry out his infernal scheme, he had purchased the
very day he offered to speak to my father, and the price of which he now
desired me to fetch. Could I have anticipated this treachery? Could I by
any chance have suspected it? Nay; so far from that, I offered with the
greatest pleasure to go at once, in my satisfaction at the good bargain
that had been made. That night I spoke with Luscinda, and told her what
had been agreed upon with Don Fernando, and how I had strong hopes of our
fair and reasonable wishes being realised. She, as unsuspicious as I was
of the treachery of Don Fernando, bade me try to return speedily, as she
believed the fulfilment of our desires would be delayed only so long as my
father put off speaking to hers. I know not why it was that on saying this
to me her eyes filled with tears, and there came a lump in her throat that
prevented her from uttering a word of many more that it seemed to me she
was striving to say to me. I was astonished at this unusual turn, which I
never before observed in her, for we always conversed, whenever good
fortune and my ingenuity gave us the chance, with the greatest gaiety and
cheerfulness, mingling tears, sighs, jealousies, doubts, or fears with our
words; it was all on my part a eulogy of my good fortune that Heaven
should have given her to me for my mistress; I glorified her beauty, I
extolled her worth and her understanding; and she paid me back by praising
in me what in her love for me she thought worthy of praise; and besides we
had a hundred thousand trifles and doings of our neighbours and
acquaintances to talk about, and the utmost extent of my boldness was to
take, almost by force, one of her fair white hands and carry it to my
lips, as well as the closeness of the low grating that separated us
allowed me. But the night before the unhappy day of my departure she wept,
she moaned, she sighed, and she withdrew leaving me filled with perplexity
and amazement, overwhelmed at the sight of such strange and affecting
signs of grief and sorrow in Luscinda; but not to dash my hopes I ascribed
it all to the depth of her love for me and the pain that separation gives
those who love tenderly. At last I took my departure, sad and dejected, my
heart filled with fancies and suspicions, but not knowing well what it was
I suspected or fancied; plain omens pointing to the sad event and
misfortune that was awaiting me.
</p>
<p>
“I reached the place whither I had been sent, gave the letter to Don
Fernando’s brother, and was kindly received but not promptly dismissed,
for he desired me to wait, very much against my will, eight days in some
place where the duke his father was not likely to see me, as his brother
wrote that the money was to be sent without his knowledge; all of which
was a scheme of the treacherous Don Fernando, for his brother had no want
of money to enable him to despatch me at once.
</p>
<p>
“The command was one that exposed me to the temptation of disobeying it,
as it seemed to me impossible to endure life for so many days separated
from Luscinda, especially after leaving her in the sorrowful mood I have
described to you; nevertheless as a dutiful servant I obeyed, though I
felt it would be at the cost of my well-being. But four days later there
came a man in quest of me with a letter which he gave me, and which by the
address I perceived to be from Luscinda, as the writing was hers. I opened
it with fear and trepidation, persuaded that it must be something serious
that had impelled her to write to me when at a distance, as she seldom did
so when I was near. Before reading it I asked the man who it was that had
given it to him, and how long he had been upon the road; he told me that
as he happened to be passing through one of the streets of the city at the
hour of noon, a very beautiful lady called to him from a window, and with
tears in her eyes said to him hurriedly, ‘Brother, if you are, as you seem
to be, a Christian, for the love of God I entreat you to have this letter
despatched without a moment’s delay to the place and person named in the
address, all which is well known, and by this you will render a great
service to our Lord; and that you may be at no inconvenience in doing so
take what is in this handkerchief;’ and said he, ‘with this she threw me a
handkerchief out of the window in which were tied up a hundred reals and
this gold ring which I bring here together with the letter I have given
you. And then without waiting for any answer she left the window, though
not before she saw me take the letter and the handkerchief, and I had by
signs let her know that I would do as she bade me; and so, seeing myself
so well paid for the trouble I would have in bringing it to you, and
knowing by the address that it was to you it was sent (for, señor, I know
you very well), and also unable to resist that beautiful lady’s tears, I
resolved to trust no one else, but to come myself and give it to you, and
in sixteen hours from the time when it was given me I have made the
journey, which, as you know, is eighteen leagues.’
</p>
<p>
“All the while the good-natured improvised courier was telling me this, I
hung upon his words, my legs trembling under me so that I could scarcely
stand. However, I opened the letter and read these words:
</p>
<p class="letter">
The promise Don Fernando gave you to urge your father to speak to mine, he has
fulfilled much more to his own satisfaction than to your advantage. I have to
tell you, señor, that he has demanded me for a wife, and my father, led away by
what he considers Don Fernando’s superiority over you, has favoured his
suit so cordially, that in two days hence the betrothal is to take place with
such secrecy and so privately that the only witnesses are to be the Heavens
above and a few of the household. Picture to yourself the state I am in; judge
if it be urgent for you to come; the issue of the affair will show you whether
I love you or not. God grant this may come to your hand before mine shall be
forced to link itself with his who keeps so ill the faith that he has pledged.
</p>
<p>
“Such, in brief, were the words of the letter, words that made me set out
at once without waiting any longer for reply or money; for I now saw
clearly that it was not the purchase of horses but of his own pleasure
that had made Don Fernando send me to his brother. The exasperation I felt
against Don Fernando, joined with the fear of losing the prize I had won
by so many years of love and devotion, lent me wings; so that almost
flying I reached home the same day, by the hour which served for speaking
with Luscinda. I arrived unobserved, and left the mule on which I had come
at the house of the worthy man who had brought me the letter, and fortune
was pleased to be for once so kind that I found Luscinda at the grating
that was the witness of our loves. She recognised me at once, and I her,
but not as she ought to have recognised me, or I her. But who is there in
the world that can boast of having fathomed or understood the wavering
mind and unstable nature of a woman? Of a truth no one. To proceed: as
soon as Luscinda saw me she said, ‘Cardenio, I am in my bridal dress, and
the treacherous Don Fernando and my covetous father are waiting for me in
the hall with the other witnesses, who shall be the witnesses of my death
before they witness my betrothal. Be not distressed, my friend, but
contrive to be present at this sacrifice, and if that cannot be prevented
by my words, I have a dagger concealed which will prevent more deliberate
violence, putting an end to my life and giving thee a first proof of the
love I have borne and bear thee.’ I replied to her distractedly and
hastily, in fear lest I should not have time to reply, ‘May thy words be
verified by thy deeds, lady; and if thou hast a dagger to save thy honour,
I have a sword to defend thee or kill myself if fortune be against us.’
</p>
<p>
“I think she could not have heard all these words, for I perceived that
they called her away in haste, as the bridegroom was waiting. Now the
night of my sorrow set in, the sun of my happiness went down, I felt my
eyes bereft of sight, my mind of reason. I could not enter the house, nor
was I capable of any movement; but reflecting how important it was that I
should be present at what might take place on the occasion, I nerved
myself as best I could and went in, for I well knew all the entrances and
outlets; and besides, with the confusion that in secret pervaded the house
no one took notice of me, so, without being seen, I found an opportunity
of placing myself in the recess formed by a window of the hall itself, and
concealed by the ends and borders of two tapestries, from between which I
could, without being seen, see all that took place in the room. Who could
describe the agitation of heart I suffered as I stood there—the
thoughts that came to me—the reflections that passed through my
mind? They were such as cannot be, nor were it well they should be, told.
Suffice it to say that the bridegroom entered the hall in his usual dress,
without ornament of any kind; as groomsman he had with him a cousin of
Luscinda’s and except the servants of the house there was no one else in
the chamber. Soon afterwards Luscinda came out from an antechamber,
attended by her mother and two of her damsels, arrayed and adorned as
became her rank and beauty, and in full festival and ceremonial attire. My
anxiety and distraction did not allow me to observe or notice particularly
what she wore; I could only perceive the colours, which were crimson and
white, and the glitter of the gems and jewels on her head dress and
apparel, surpassed by the rare beauty of her lovely auburn hair that vying
with the precious stones and the light of the four torches that stood in
the hall shone with a brighter gleam than all. Oh memory, mortal foe of my
peace! why bring before me now the incomparable beauty of that adored
enemy of mine? Were it not better, cruel memory, to remind me and recall
what she then did, that stirred by a wrong so glaring I may seek, if not
vengeance now, at least to rid myself of life? Be not weary, sirs, of
listening to these digressions; my sorrow is not one of those that can or
should be told tersely and briefly, for to me each incident seems to call
for many words.”
</p>
<p>
To this the curate replied that not only were they not weary of listening
to him, but that the details he mentioned interested them greatly, being
of a kind by no means to be omitted and deserving of the same attention as
the main story.
</p>
<p>
“To proceed, then,” continued Cardenio: “all being assembled in the hall,
the priest of the parish came in and as he took the pair by the hand to
perform the requisite ceremony, at the words, ‘Will you, Señora Luscinda,
take Señor Don Fernando, here present, for your lawful husband, as the
holy Mother Church ordains?’ I thrust my head and neck out from between
the tapestries, and with eager ears and throbbing heart set myself to
listen to Luscinda’s answer, awaiting in her reply the sentence of death
or the grant of life. Oh, that I had but dared at that moment to rush
forward crying aloud, ‘Luscinda, Luscinda! have a care what thou dost;
remember what thou owest me; bethink thee thou art mine and canst not be
another’s; reflect that thy utterance of “Yes” and the end of my life will
come at the same instant. O, treacherous Don Fernando! robber of my glory,
death of my life! What seekest thou? Remember that thou canst not as a
Christian attain the object of thy wishes, for Luscinda is my bride, and I
am her husband!’ Fool that I am! now that I am far away, and out of
danger, I say I should have done what I did not do: now that I have
allowed my precious treasure to be robbed from me, I curse the robber, on
whom I might have taken vengeance had I as much heart for it as I have for
bewailing my fate; in short, as I was then a coward and a fool, little
wonder is it if I am now dying shame-stricken, remorseful, and mad.
</p>
<p>
“The priest stood waiting for the answer of Luscinda, who for a long time
withheld it; and just as I thought she was taking out the dagger to save
her honour, or struggling for words to make some declaration of the truth
on my behalf, I heard her say in a faint and feeble voice, ‘I will:’ Don
Fernando said the same, and giving her the ring they stood linked by a
knot that could never be loosed. The bridegroom then approached to embrace
his bride; and she, pressing her hand upon her heart, fell fainting in her
mother’s arms. It only remains now for me to tell you the state I was in
when in that consent that I heard I saw all my hopes mocked, the words and
promises of Luscinda proved falsehoods, and the recovery of the prize I
had that instant lost rendered impossible for ever. I stood stupefied,
wholly abandoned, it seemed, by Heaven, declared the enemy of the earth
that bore me, the air refusing me breath for my sighs, the water moisture
for my tears; it was only the fire that gathered strength so that my whole
frame glowed with rage and jealousy. They were all thrown into confusion
by Luscinda’s fainting, and as her mother was unlacing her to give her air
a sealed paper was discovered in her bosom which Don Fernando seized at
once and began to read by the light of one of the torches. As soon as he
had read it he seated himself in a chair, leaning his cheek on his hand in
the attitude of one deep in thought, without taking any part in the
efforts that were being made to recover his bride from her fainting fit.
</p>
<p>
“Seeing all the household in confusion, I ventured to come out regardless
whether I were seen or not, and determined, if I were, to do some frenzied
deed that would prove to all the world the righteous indignation of my
breast in the punishment of the treacherous Don Fernando, and even in that
of the fickle fainting traitress. But my fate, doubtless reserving me for
greater sorrows, if such there be, so ordered it that just then I had
enough and to spare of that reason which has since been wanting to me; and
so, without seeking to take vengeance on my greatest enemies (which might
have been easily taken, as all thought of me was so far from their minds),
I resolved to take it upon myself, and on myself to inflict the pain they
deserved, perhaps with even greater severity than I should have dealt out

execration and upbraiding, I found excuses for her, saying it was no
wonder that a young girl in the seclusion of her parents’ house, trained
and schooled to obey them always, should have been ready to yield to their
wishes when they offered her for a husband a gentleman of such
distinction, wealth, and noble birth, that if she had refused to accept
him she would have been thought out of her senses, or to have set her
affection elsewhere, a suspicion injurious to her fair name and fame. But
then again, I said, had she declared I was her husband, they would have
seen that in choosing me she had not chosen so ill but that they might
excuse her, for before Don Fernando had made his offer, they themselves
