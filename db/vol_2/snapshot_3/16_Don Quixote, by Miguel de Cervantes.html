graduate of Osuna, get out of my presence at once; or I swear by the sun I’ll
take a cudgel, and by dint of blows, beginning with him, I’ll not
leave a doctor in the whole island; at least of those I know to be
ignorant; for as to learned, wise, sensible physicians, them I will
reverence and honour as divine persons. Once more I say let Pedro Recio
get out of this or I’ll take this chair I am sitting on and break it
over his head. And if they call me to account for it, I’ll clear
myself by saying I served God in killing a bad doctor—a general
executioner. And now give me something to eat, or else take your
government; for a trade that does not feed its master is not worth two
beans.”
</p>
<p>
The doctor was dismayed when he saw the governor in such a passion, and he
would have made a Tirteafuera out of the room but that the same instant a
post-horn sounded in the street; and the carver putting his head out of
the window turned round and said, “It’s a courier from my lord
the duke, no doubt with some despatch of importance.”
</p>
<p>
The courier came in all sweating and flurried, and taking a paper from his
bosom, placed it in the governor’s hands. Sancho handed it to the
majordomo and bade him read the superscription, which ran thus:
</p>
<p>
<i>To Don Sancho Panza, Governor of the Island of Barataria, into his own hands
or those of his secretary.</i>
</p>
<p class="noindent">
Sancho when he heard this said, “Which of you is my secretary?”
“I am, señor,” said one of those present, “for I can read and
write, and am a Biscayan.” “With that addition,” said Sancho,
“you might be secretary to the emperor himself; open this paper and see
what it says.” The new-born secretary obeyed, and having read the
contents said the matter was one to be discussed in private. Sancho ordered the
chamber to be cleared, the majordomo and the carver only remaining; so the
doctor and the others withdrew, and then the secretary read the letter, which
was as follows:
</p>
<p class="letter">
It has come to my knowledge, Señor Don Sancho Panza, that certain enemies of
mine and of the island are about to make a furious attack upon it some night, I
know not when. It behoves you to be on the alert and keep watch, that they
surprise you not. I also know by trustworthy spies that four persons have
entered the town in disguise in order to take your life, because they stand in
dread of your great capacity; keep your eyes open and take heed who approaches
you to address you, and eat nothing that is presented to you. I will take care
to send you aid if you find yourself in difficulty, but in all things you will
act as may be expected of your judgment. From this place, the Sixteenth of
August, at four in the morning.
</p>
<p class="right">
Your friend,<br>
THE DUKE
</p>
<p>
Sancho was astonished, and those who stood by made believe to be so too,
and turning to the majordomo he said to him, “What we have got to do
first, and it must be done at once, is to put Doctor Recio in the lock-up;
for if anyone wants to kill me it is he, and by a slow death and the worst
of all, which is hunger.”
</p>
<p>
“Likewise,” said the carver, “it is my opinion your
worship should not eat anything that is on this table, for the whole was a
present from some nuns; and as they say, ‘behind the cross there’s
the devil.’”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t deny it,” said Sancho; “so for the
present give me a piece of bread and four pounds or so of grapes; no
poison can come in them; for the fact is I can’t go on without
eating; and if we are to be prepared for these battles that are
threatening us we must be well provisioned; for it is the tripes that
carry the heart and not the heart the tripes. And you, secretary, answer
my lord the duke and tell him that all his commands shall be obeyed to the
letter, as he directs; and say from me to my lady the duchess that I kiss
her hands, and that I beg of her not to forget to send my letter and
bundle to my wife Teresa Panza by a messenger; and I will take it as a
great favour and will not fail to serve her in all that may lie within my
power; and as you are about it you may enclose a kiss of the hand to my
master Don Quixote that he may see I am grateful bread; and as a good
secretary and a good Biscayan you may add whatever you like and whatever
will come in best; and now take away this cloth and give me something to
eat, and I’ll be ready to meet all the spies and assassins and
enchanters that may come against me or my island.”
</p>
<p>
At this instant a page entered saying, “Here is a farmer on
business, who wants to speak to your lordship on a matter of great
importance, he says.”
</p>
<p>
“It’s very odd,” said Sancho, “the ways of these
men on business; is it possible they can be such fools as not to see that
an hour like this is no hour for coming on business? We who govern and we
who are judges—are we not men of flesh and blood, and are we not to
be allowed the time required for taking rest, unless they’d have us
made of marble? By God and on my conscience, if the government remains in
my hands (which I have a notion it won’t), I’ll bring more
than one man on business to order. However, tell this good man to come in;
but take care first of all that he is not some spy or one of my assassins.”
</p>
<p>
“No, my lord,” said the page, “for he looks like a
simple fellow, and either I know very little or he is as good as good
bread.”
</p>
<p>
“There is nothing to be afraid of,” said the majordomo,
“for we are all here.”
</p>
<p>
“Would it be possible, carver,” said Sancho, “now that
Doctor Pedro Recio is not here, to let me eat something solid and
substantial, if it were even a piece of bread and an onion?”
</p>
<p>
“To-night at supper,” said the carver, “the shortcomings
of the dinner shall be made good, and your lordship shall be fully
contented.”
</p>
<p>
“God grant it,” said Sancho.
</p>
<p>
The farmer now came in, a well-favoured man that one might see a thousand
leagues off was an honest fellow and a good soul. The first thing he said
was, “Which is the lord governor here?”
</p>
<p>
“Which should it be,” said the secretary, “but he who is
seated in the chair?”
</p>
<p>
“Then I humble myself before him,” said the farmer; and going
on his knees he asked for his hand, to kiss it. Sancho refused it, and
bade him stand up and say what he wanted. The farmer obeyed, and then
said, “I am a farmer, señor, a native of Miguelturra, a village two
leagues from Ciudad Real.”
</p>
<p>
“Another Tirteafuera!” said Sancho; “say on, brother; I
know Miguelturra very well I can tell you, for it’s not very far
from my own town.”
</p>
<p>
“The case is this, señor,” continued the farmer, “that
by God’s mercy I am married with the leave and licence of the holy
Roman Catholic Church; I have two sons, students, and the younger is
studying to become bachelor, and the elder to be licentiate; I am a
widower, for my wife died, or more properly speaking, a bad doctor killed
her on my hands, giving her a purge when she was with child; and if it had
pleased God that the child had been born, and was a boy, I would have put
him to study for doctor, that he might not envy his brothers the bachelor
and the licentiate.”
</p>
<p>
“So that if your wife had not died, or had not been killed, you
would not now be a widower,” said Sancho.
</p>
<p>
“No, señor, certainly not,” said the farmer.
</p>
<p>
“We’ve got that much settled,” said Sancho; “get
on, brother, for it’s more bed-time than business-time.”
</p>
<p>
“Well then,” said the farmer, “this son of mine who is
going to be a bachelor, fell in love in the said town with a damsel called
Clara Perlerina, daughter of Andres Perlerino, a very rich farmer; and
this name of Perlerines does not come to them by ancestry or descent, but
because all the family are paralytics, and for a better name they call
them Perlerines; though to tell the truth the damsel is as fair as an
Oriental pearl, and like a flower of the field, if you look at her on the
right side; on the left not so much, for on that side she wants an eye
that she lost by small-pox; and though her face is thickly and deeply
pitted, those who love her say they are not pits that are there, but the
graves where the hearts of her lovers are buried. She is so cleanly that
not to soil her face she carries her nose turned up, as they say, so that
one would fancy it was running away from her mouth; and with all this she
looks extremely well, for she has a wide mouth; and but for wanting ten or
a dozen teeth and grinders she might compare and compete with the
comeliest. Of her lips I say nothing, for they are so fine and thin that,
if lips might be reeled, one might make a skein of them; but being of a
different colour from ordinary lips they are wonderful, for they are
mottled, blue, green, and purple—let my lord the governor pardon me
for painting so minutely the charms of her who some time or other will be
my daughter; for I love her, and I don’t find her amiss.”
</p>
<p>
“Paint what you will,” said Sancho; “I enjoy your
painting, and if I had dined there could be no dessert more to my taste
than your portrait.”
</p>
<p>
“That I have still to furnish,” said the farmer; “but a
time will come when we may be able if we are not now; and I can tell you,
señor, if I could paint her gracefulness and her tall figure, it would
astonish you; but that is impossible because she is bent double with her
knees up to her mouth; but for all that it is easy to see that if she
could stand up she’d knock her head against the ceiling; and she
would have given her hand to my bachelor ere this, only that she can’t
stretch it out, for it’s contracted; but still one can see its
elegance and fine make by its long furrowed nails.”
</p>
<p>
“That will do, brother,” said Sancho; “consider you have
painted her from head to foot; what is it you want now? Come to the point
without all this beating about the bush, and all these scraps and
additions.”
</p>
<p>
“I want your worship, señor,” said the farmer, “to do me
the favour of giving me a letter of recommendation to the girl’s
father, begging him to be so good as to let this marriage take place, as
we are not ill-matched either in the gifts of fortune or of nature; for to
tell the truth, señor governor, my son is possessed of a devil, and there
is not a day but the evil spirits torment him three or four times; and
from having once fallen into the fire, he has his face puckered up like a
piece of parchment, and his eyes watery and always running; but he has the
disposition of an angel, and if it was not for belabouring and pummelling
himself he’d be a saint.”
</p>
<p>
“Is there anything else you want, good man?” said Sancho.
</p>
<p>
“There’s another thing I’d like,” said the farmer,
“but I’m afraid to mention it; however, out it must; for after
all I can’t let it be rotting in my breast, come what may. I mean,
señor, that I’d like your worship to give me three hundred or six
hundred ducats as a help to my bachelor’s portion, to help him in
setting up house; for they must, in short, live by themselves, without
being subject to the interferences of their fathers-in-law.”
</p>
<p>
“Just see if there’s anything else you’d like,”
said Sancho, “and don’t hold back from mentioning it out of
bashfulness or modesty.”
</p>
<p>
“No, indeed there is not,” said the farmer.
</p>
<p>
The moment he said this the governor started to his feet, and seizing the
chair he had been sitting on exclaimed, “By all that’s good,
you ill-bred, boorish Don Bumpkin, if you don’t get out of this at
once and hide yourself from my sight, I’ll lay your head open with
this chair. You whoreson rascal, you devil’s own painter, and is it
at this hour you come to ask me for six hundred ducats! How should I have
them, you stinking brute? And why should I give them to you if I had them,
you knave and blockhead? What have I to do with Miguelturra or the whole
family of the Perlerines? Get out I say, or by the life of my lord the
duke I’ll do as I said. You’re not from Miguelturra, but some
knave sent here from hell to tempt me. Why, you villain, I have not yet
had the government half a day, and you want me to have six hundred ducats
already!”
</p>
<p>
The carver made signs to the farmer to leave the room, which he did with
his head down, and to all appearance in terror lest the governor should
carry his threats into effect, for the rogue knew very well how to play
his part.
</p>
<p>
But let us leave Sancho in his wrath, and peace be with them all; and let
us return to Don Quixote, whom we left with his face bandaged and doctored
after the cat wounds, of which he was not cured for eight days; and on one
of these there befell him what Cide Hamete promises to relate with that
exactitude and truth with which he is wont to set forth everything
connected with this great history, however minute it may be.

Exceedingly moody and dejected was the sorely wounded Don Quixote, with
his face bandaged and marked, not by the hand of God, but by the claws of
a cat, mishaps incidental to knight-errantry.

<p>
Six days he remained without appearing in public, and one night as he lay
awake thinking of his misfortunes and of Altisidora’s pursuit of
him, he perceived that someone was opening the door of his room with a
key, and he at once made up his mind that the enamoured damsel was coming
to make an assault upon his chastity and put him in danger of failing in
the fidelity he owed to his lady Dulcinea del Toboso. “No,”
said he, firmly persuaded of the truth of his idea (and he said it loud
enough to be heard), “the greatest beauty upon earth shall not avail
to make me renounce my adoration of her whom I bear stamped and graved in
the core of my heart and the secret depths of my bowels; be thou, lady
mine, transformed into a clumsy country wench, or into a nymph of golden
Tagus weaving a web of silk and gold, let Merlin or Montesinos hold thee
captive where they will; where’er thou art, thou art mine, and where’er
I am, must be thine.” The very instant he had uttered these words,
the door opened. He stood up on the bed wrapped from head to foot in a
yellow satin coverlet, with a cap on his head, and his face and his
moustaches tied up, his face because of the scratches, and his moustaches
to keep them from drooping and falling down, in which trim he looked the
most extraordinary scarecrow that could be conceived. He kept his eyes
fixed on the door, and just as he was expecting to see the love-smitten
and unhappy Altisidora make her appearance, he saw coming in a most
venerable duenna, in a long white-bordered veil that covered and enveloped
her from head to foot. Between the fingers of her left hand she held a
short lighted candle, while with her right she shaded it to keep the light
from her eyes, which were covered by spectacles of great size, and she
advanced with noiseless steps, treading very softly.
</p>
<p>
Don Quixote kept an eye upon her from his watchtower, and observing her
costume and noting her silence, he concluded that it must be some witch or
sorceress that was coming in such a guise to work him some mischief, and
he began crossing himself at a great rate. The spectre still advanced, and
on reaching the middle of the room, looked up and saw the energy with
which Don Quixote was crossing himself; and if he was scared by seeing
such a figure as hers, she was terrified at the sight of his; for the
moment she saw his tall yellow form with the coverlet and the bandages
that disfigured him, she gave a loud scream, and exclaiming, “Jesus!
what’s this I see?” let fall the candle in her fright, and
then finding herself in the dark, turned about to make off, but stumbling
on her skirts in her consternation, she measured her length with a mighty
fall.

</p>
<p>
Don Quixote in his trepidation began saying, “I conjure thee,
phantom, or whatever thou art, tell me what thou art and what thou wouldst
with me. If thou art a soul in torment, say so, and all that my powers can
do I will do for thee; for I am a Catholic Christian and love to do good
to all the world, and to this end I have embraced the order of
knight-errantry to which I belong, the province of which extends to doing
good even to souls in purgatory.”
</p>
<p>
The unfortunate duenna hearing herself thus conjured, by her own fear
guessed Don Quixote’s and in a low plaintive voice answered, “Señor
Don Quixote—if so be you are indeed Don Quixote—I am no
phantom or spectre or soul in purgatory, as you seem to think, but Doña
Rodriguez, duenna of honour to my lady the duchess, and I come to you with
one of those grievances your worship is wont to redress.”
</p>
<p>
“Tell me, Señora Doña Rodriguez,” said Don Quixote, “do
you perchance come to transact any go-between business? Because I must
tell you I am not available for anybody’s purpose, thanks to the
peerless beauty of my lady Dulcinea del Toboso. In short, Señora Doña
Rodriguez, if you will leave out and put aside all love messages, you may
go and light your candle and come back, and we will discuss all the
commands you have for me and whatever you wish, saving only, as I said,
all seductive communications.”
</p>
<p>
“I carry nobody’s messages, señor,” said the duenna;
“little you know me. Nay, I’m not far enough advanced in years
to take to any such childish tricks. God be praised I have a soul in my
body still, and all my teeth and grinders in my mouth, except one or two
that the colds, so common in this Aragon country, have robbed me of. But
wait a little, while I go and light my candle, and I will return
immediately and lay my sorrows before you as before one who relieves those
of all the world;” and without staying for an answer she quitted the
room and left Don Quixote tranquilly meditating while he waited for her. A
thousand thoughts at once suggested themselves to him on the subject of
this new adventure, and it struck him as being ill done and worse advised
in him to expose himself to the danger of breaking his plighted faith to
his lady; and said he to himself, “Who knows but that the devil,
being wily and cunning, may be trying now to entrap me with a duenna,
having failed with empresses, queens, duchesses, marchionesses, and
countesses? Many a time have I heard it said by many a man of sense that
he will sooner offer you a flat-nosed wench than a roman-nosed one; and
who knows but this privacy, this opportunity, this silence, may awaken my
sleeping desires, and lead me in these my latter years to fall where I
have never tripped? In cases of this sort it is better to flee than to
await the battle. But I must be out of my senses to think and utter such
nonsense; for it is impossible that a long, white-hooded spectacled duenna
could stir up or excite a wanton thought in the most graceless bosom in
the world. Is there a duenna on earth that has fair flesh? Is there a
duenna in the world that escapes being ill-tempered, wrinkled, and
prudish? Avaunt, then, ye duenna crew, undelightful to all mankind. Oh,
but that lady did well who, they say, had at the end of her reception room
a couple of figures of duennas with spectacles and lace-cushions, as if at
work, and those statues served quite as well to give an air of propriety
to the room as if they had been real duennas.”
</p>
<p>
So saying he leaped off the bed, intending to close the door and not allow
Señora Rodriguez to enter; but as he went to shut it Señora Rodriguez
returned with a wax candle lighted, and having a closer view of Don
Quixote, with the coverlet round him, and his bandages and night-cap, she
was alarmed afresh, and retreating a couple of paces, exclaimed, “Am
I safe, sir knight? for I don’t look upon it as a sign of very great
virtue that your worship should have got up out of bed.”
</p>
<p>
“I may well ask the same, señora,” said Don Quixote; “and
I do ask whether I shall be safe from being assailed and forced?”
</p>
<p>
“Of whom and against whom do you demand that security, sir knight?”
said the duenna.
</p>
<p>
“Of you and against you I ask it,” said Don Quixote; “for
I am not marble, nor are you brass, nor is it now ten o’clock in the
morning, but midnight, or a trifle past it I fancy, and we are in a room
more secluded and retired than the cave could have been where the
treacherous and daring Æneas enjoyed the fair soft-hearted Dido. But give
me your hand, señora; I require no better protection than my own
continence, and my own sense of propriety; as well as that which is
inspired by that venerable head-dress;” and so saying he kissed her
right hand and took it in his own, she yielding it to him with equal
ceremoniousness. And here Cide Hamete inserts a parenthesis in which he
says that to have seen the pair marching from the door to the bed, linked
hand in hand in this way, he would have given the best of the two tunics
he had.
</p>
<p>
Don Quixote finally got into bed, and Doña Rodriguez took her seat on a
chair at some little distance from his couch, without taking off her
spectacles or putting aside the candle. Don Quixote wrapped the bedclothes
round him and covered himself up completely, leaving nothing but his face
visible, and as soon as they had both regained their composure he broke
silence, saying, “Now, Señora Doña Rodriguez, you may unbosom
yourself and out with everything you have in your sorrowful heart and
afflicted bowels; and by me you shall be listened to with chaste ears, and
aided by compassionate exertions.”
</p>
<p>
“I believe it,” replied the duenna; “from your worship’s
gentle and winning presence only such a Christian answer could be
expected. The fact is, then, Señor Don Quixote, that though you see me
seated in this chair, here in the middle of the kingdom of Aragon, and in
the attire of a despised outcast duenna, I am from the Asturias of Oviedo,
and of a family with which many of the best of the province are connected
by blood; but my untoward fate and the improvidence of my parents, who, I
know not how, were unseasonably reduced to poverty, brought me to the
court of Madrid, where as a provision and to avoid greater misfortunes, my
parents placed me as seamstress in the service of a lady of quality, and I
would have you know that for hemming and sewing I have never been
surpassed by any all my life. My parents left me in service and returned
to their own country, and a few years later went, no doubt, to heaven, for
they were excellent good Catholic Christians. I was left an orphan with
nothing but the miserable wages and trifling presents that are given to
servants of my sort in palaces; but about this time, without any
encouragement on my part, one of the esquires of the household fell in
love with me, a man somewhat advanced in years, full-bearded and
personable, and above all as good a gentleman as the king himself, for he
came of a mountain stock. We did not carry on our loves with such secrecy
but that they came to the knowledge of my lady, and she, not to have any
fuss about it, had us married with the full sanction of the holy mother
Roman Catholic Church, of which marriage a daughter was born to put an end
to my good fortune, if I had any; not that I died in childbirth, for I
passed through it safely and in due season, but because shortly afterwards
my husband died of a certain shock he received, and had I time to tell you
of it I know your worship would be surprised;” and here she began to
weep bitterly and said, “Pardon me, Señor Don Quixote, if I am
unable to control myself, for every time I think of my unfortunate husband
my eyes fill up with tears. God bless me, with what an air of dignity he
used to carry my lady behind him on a stout mule as black as jet! for in
those days they did not use coaches or chairs, as they say they do now,
and ladies rode behind their squires. This much at least I cannot help
telling you, that you may observe the good breeding and punctiliousness of
my worthy husband. As he was turning into the Calle de Santiago in Madrid,
which is rather narrow, one of the alcaldes of the Court, with two
alguacils before him, was coming out of it, and as soon as my good squire
saw him he wheeled his mule about and made as if he would turn and
accompany him. My lady, who was riding behind him, said to him in a low
voice, ‘What are you about, you sneak, don’t you see that I am
here?’ The alcalde like a polite man pulled up his horse and said to
him, ‘Proceed, señor, for it is I, rather, who ought to accompany my
lady Doña Casilda’—for that was my mistress’s name.
Still my husband, cap in hand, persisted in trying to accompany the
alcalde, and seeing this my lady, filled with rage and vexation, pulled
out a big pin, or, I rather think, a bodkin, out of her needle-case and
drove it into his back with such force that my husband gave a loud yell,
and writhing fell to the ground with his lady. Her two lacqueys ran to
rise her up, and the alcalde and the alguacils did the same; the
Guadalajara gate was all in commotion—I mean the idlers congregated
there; my mistress came back on foot, and my husband hurried away to a
barber’s shop protesting that he was run right through the guts. The
courtesy of my husband was noised abroad to such an extent, that the boys
gave him no peace in the street; and on this account, and because he was
somewhat shortsighted, my lady dismissed him; and it was chagrin at this I
am convinced beyond a doubt that brought on his death. I was left a
helpless widow, with a daughter on my hands growing up in beauty like the
sea-foam; at length, however, as I had the character of being an excellent
needlewoman, my lady the duchess, then lately married to my lord the duke,
offered to take me with her to this kingdom of Aragon, and my daughter
also, and here as time went by my daughter grew up and with her all the
graces in the world; she sings like a lark, dances quick as thought, foots
it like a gipsy, reads and writes like a schoolmaster, and does sums like
a miser; of her neatness I say nothing, for the running water is not
purer, and her age is now, if my memory serves me, sixteen years five
months and three days, one more or less. To come to the point, the son of
a very rich farmer, living in a village of my lord the duke’s not
very far from here, fell in love with this girl of mine; and in short, how
I know not, they came together, and under the promise of marrying her he
made a fool of my daughter, and will not keep his word. And though my lord
the duke is aware of it (for I have complained to him, not once but many
and many a time, and entreated him to order the farmer to marry my
daughter), he turns a deaf ear and will scarcely listen to me; the reason
being that as the deceiver’s father is so rich, and lends him money,
and is constantly going security for his debts, he does not like to offend
or annoy him in any way. Now, señor, I want your worship to take it upon
yourself to redress this wrong either by entreaty or by arms; for by what
all the world says you came into it to redress grievances and right wrongs
and help the unfortunate. Let your worship put before you the unprotected
condition of my daughter, her youth, and all the perfections I have said
she possesses; and before God and on my conscience, out of all the damsels
my lady has, there is not one that comes up to the sole of her shoe, and
the one they call Altisidora, and look upon as the boldest and gayest of
them, put in comparison with my daughter, does not come within two leagues
of her. For I would have you know, señor, all is not gold that glitters,
and that same little Altisidora has more forwardness than good looks, and
more impudence than modesty; besides being not very sound, for she has
such a disagreeable breath that one cannot bear to be near her for a
moment; and even my lady the duchess—but I’ll hold my tongue,
for they say that walls have ears.”
</p>
<p>
“For heaven’s sake, Doña Rodriguez, what ails my lady the
duchess?” asked Don Quixote.
</p>
<p>
“Adjured in that way,” replied the duenna, “I cannot
help answering the question and telling the whole truth. Señor Don
Quixote, have you observed the comeliness of my lady the duchess, that
smooth complexion of hers like a burnished polished sword, those two
cheeks of milk and carmine, that gay lively step with which she treads or
rather seems to spurn the earth, so that one would fancy she went
radiating health wherever she passed? Well then, let me tell you she may
thank, first of all God, for this, and next, two issues that she has, one
in each leg, by which all the evil humours, of which the doctors say she
is full, are discharged.”
</p>
<p>
“Blessed Virgin!” exclaimed Don Quixote; “and is it
possible that my lady the duchess has drains of that sort? I would not
have believed it if the barefoot friars had told it me; but as the lady
Doña Rodriguez says so, it must be so. But surely such issues, and in such
places, do not discharge humours, but liquid amber. Verily, I do believe
now that this practice of opening issues is a very important matter for
the health.”
</p>
<p>
Don Quixote had hardly said this, when the chamber door flew open with a
loud bang, and with the start the noise gave her Doña Rodriguez let the
candle fall from her hand, and the room was left as dark as a wolf’s
mouth, as the saying is. Suddenly the poor duenna felt two hands seize her
by the throat, so tightly that she could not croak, while someone else,
without uttering a word, very briskly hoisted up her petticoats, and with
what seemed to be a slipper began to lay on so heartily that anyone would
have felt pity for her; but although Don Quixote felt it he never stirred
from his bed, but lay quiet and silent, nay apprehensive that his turn for
a drubbing might be coming. Nor was the apprehension an idle one; for
leaving the duenna (who did not dare to cry out) well basted, the silent
executioners fell upon Don Quixote, and stripping him of the sheet and the
coverlet, they pinched him so fast and so hard that he was driven to
defend himself with his fists, and all this in marvellous silence. The
battle lasted nearly half an hour, and then the phantoms fled; Doña
Rodriguez gathered up her skirts, and bemoaning her fate went out without
saying a word to Don Quixote, and he, sorely pinched, puzzled, and
dejected, remained alone, and there we will leave him, wondering who could
have been the perverse enchanter who had reduced him to such a state; but
that shall be told in due season, for Sancho claims our attention, and the
methodical arrangement of the story demands it.

<p>
We left the great governor angered and irritated by that portrait-painting
rogue of a farmer who, instructed by the majordomo, as the majordomo was by the
duke, tried to practise upon him; he however, fool, boor, and clown as he was,
held his own against them all, saying to those round him and to Doctor Pedro
Recio, who as soon as the private business of the duke’s letter was
disposed of had returned to the room, “Now I see plainly enough that
judges and governors ought to be and must be made of brass not to feel the
importunities of the applicants that at all times and all seasons insist on
being heard, and having their business despatched, and their own affairs and no
others attended to, come what may; and if the poor judge does not hear them and
settle the matter—either because he cannot or because that is not the
time set apart for hearing them—forthwith they abuse him, and run him
down, and gnaw at his bones, and even pick holes in his pedigree. You silly,
stupid applicant, don’t be in a hurry; wait for the proper time and
season for doing business; don’t come at dinner-hour, or at bed-time; for
judges are only flesh and blood, and must give to Nature what she naturally
demands of them; all except myself, for in my case I give her nothing to eat,
thanks to Señor Doctor Pedro Recio Tirteafuera here, who would have me die of
hunger, and declares that death to be life; and the same sort of life may God
give him and all his kind—I mean the bad doctors; for the good ones
deserve palms and laurels.”
</p>
<p>
All who knew Sancho Panza were astonished to hear him speak so elegantly,
and did not know what to attribute it to unless it were that office and
grave responsibility either smarten or stupefy men’s wits. At last
Doctor Pedro Recio Agilers of Tirteafuera promised to let him have supper
that night though it might be in contravention of all the aphorisms of
Hippocrates. With this the governor was satisfied and looked forward to
the approach of night and supper-time with great anxiety; and though time,
to his mind, stood still and made no progress, nevertheless the hour he so
longed for came, and they gave him a beef salad with onions and some
boiled calves’ feet rather far gone. At this he fell to with greater
relish than if they had given him francolins from Milan, pheasants from
Rome, veal from Sorrento, partridges from Moron, or geese from Lavajos,
and turning to the doctor at supper he said to him, “Look here,
señor doctor, for the future don’t trouble yourself about giving me
dainty things or choice dishes to eat, for it will be only taking my
stomach off its hinges; it is accustomed to goat, cow, bacon, hung beef,
turnips and onions; and if by any chance it is given these palace dishes,
it receives them squeamishly, and sometimes with loathing. What the
head-carver had best do is to serve me with what they call ollas podridas
(and the rottener they are the better they smell); and he can put whatever
he likes into them, so long as it is good to eat, and I’ll be
obliged to him, and will requite him some day. But let nobody play pranks
on me, for either we are or we are not; let us live and eat in peace and
good-fellowship, for when God sends the dawn, he sends it for all. I mean
to govern this island without giving up a right or taking a bribe; let
everyone keep his eye open, and look out for the arrow; for I can tell
them ‘the devil’s in Cantillana,’ and if they drive me
to it they’ll see something that will astonish them. Nay! make
yourself honey and the flies eat you.”
</p>
<p>
“Of a truth, señor governor,” said the carver, “your
worship is in the right of it in everything you have said; and I promise
you in the name of all the inhabitants of this island that they will serve
your worship with all zeal, affection, and good-will, for the mild kind of
government you have given a sample of to begin with, leaves them no ground
for doing or thinking anything to your worship’s disadvantage.”
</p>
<p>
“That I believe,” said Sancho; “and they would be great
fools if they did or thought otherwise; once more I say, see to my feeding
and my Dapple’s for that is the great point and what is most to the
purpose; and when the hour comes let us go the rounds, for it is my
intention to purge this island of all manner of uncleanness and of all
idle good-for-nothing vagabonds; for I would have you know that lazy
idlers are the same thing in a State as the drones in a hive, that eat up
the honey the industrious bees make. I mean to protect the husbandman, to
preserve to the gentleman his privileges, to reward the virtuous, and
above all to respect religion and honour its ministers. What say you to
that, my friends? Is there anything in what I say, or am I talking to no
purpose?”
</p>
<p>
“There is so much in what your worship says, señor governor,”
said the majordomo, “that I am filled with wonder when I see a man
like your worship, entirely without learning (for I believe you have none
at all), say such things, and so full of sound maxims and sage remarks,
very different from what was expected of your worship’s intelligence
by those who sent us or by us who came here. Every day we see something
new in this world; jokes become realities, and the jokers find the tables
turned upon them.”
</p>
<p>
Night came, and with the permission of Doctor Pedro Recio, the governor
had supper. They then got ready to go the rounds, and he started with the
majordomo, the secretary, the head-carver, the chronicler charged with
recording his deeds, and alguacils and notaries enough to form a
fair-sized squadron. In the midst marched Sancho with his staff, as fine a
sight as one could wish to see, and but a few streets of the town had been
traversed when they heard a noise as of a clashing of swords. They
hastened to the spot, and found that the combatants were but two, who
seeing the authorities approaching stood still, and one of them exclaimed,
“Help, in the name of God and the king! Are men to be allowed to rob
in the middle of this town, and rush out and attack people in the very
streets?”
</p>
<p>
“Be calm, my good man,” said Sancho, “and tell me what
the cause of this quarrel is; for I am the governor.”
</p>
<p>
Said the other combatant, “Señor governor, I will tell you in a very
few words. Your worship must know that this gentleman has just now won
more than a thousand reals in that gambling house opposite, and God knows
how. I was there, and gave more than one doubtful point in his favour,
very much against what my conscience told me. He made off with his
winnings, and when I made sure he was going to give me a crown or so at
least by way of a present, as it is usual and customary to give men of
quality of my sort who stand by to see fair or foul play, and back up
swindles, and prevent quarrels, he pocketed his money and left the house.
Indignant at this I followed him, and speaking to him fairly and civilly
asked him to give me if it were only eight reals, for he knows I am an
honest man and that I have neither profession nor property, for my parents
never brought me up to any or left me any; but the rogue, who is a greater
thief than Cacus and a greater sharper than Andradilla, would not give me
more than four reals; so your worship may see how little shame and
conscience he has. But by my faith if you had not come up I’d have
made him disgorge his winnings, and he’d have learned what the range
of the steel-yard was.”
</p>
<p>
“What say you to this?” asked Sancho. The other replied that
all his antagonist said was true, and that he did not choose to give him
more than four reals because he very often gave him money; and that those
who expected presents ought to be civil and take what is given them with a
cheerful countenance, and not make any claim against winners unless they
know them for certain to be sharpers and their winnings to be unfairly
won; and that there could be no better proof that he himself was an honest
man than his having refused to give anything; for sharpers always pay
tribute to lookers-on who know them.
</p>
<p>
“That is true,” said the majordomo; “let your worship
consider what is to be done with these men.”
</p>
<p>
“What is to be done,” said Sancho, “is this; you, the
winner, be you good, bad, or indifferent, give this assailant of yours a
hundred reals at once, and you must disburse thirty more for the poor
prisoners; and you who have neither profession nor property, and hang
about the island in idleness, take these hundred reals now, and some time
of the day to-morrow quit the island under sentence of banishment for ten
years, and under pain of completing it in another life if you violate the
sentence, for I’ll hang you on a gibbet, or at least the hangman
will by my orders; not a word from either of you, or I’ll make him
feel my hand.”
</p>
<p>
The one paid down the money and the other took it, and the latter quitted
the island, while the other went home; and then the governor said, “Either
I am not good for much, or I’ll get rid of these gambling houses,
for it strikes me they are very mischievous.”
</p>
<p>
“This one at least,” said one of the notaries, “your
worship will not be able to get rid of, for a great man owns it, and what
he loses every year is beyond all comparison more than what he makes by
the cards. On the minor gambling houses your worship may exercise your
power, and it is they that do most harm and shelter the most barefaced
practices; for in the houses of lords and gentlemen of quality the
notorious sharpers dare not attempt to play their tricks; and as the vice
of gambling has become common, it is better that men should play in houses
of repute than in some tradesman’s, where they catch an unlucky
fellow in the small hours of the morning and skin him alive.”
</p>
<p>
“I know already, notary, that there is a good deal to be said on
that point,” said Sancho.
</p>
<p>
And now a tipstaff came up with a young man in his grasp, and said,
“Señor governor, this youth was coming towards us, and as soon as he
saw the officers of justice he turned about and ran like a deer, a sure
proof that he must be some evil-doer; I ran after him, and had it not been
that he stumbled and fell, I should never have caught him.”
</p>
<p>
“What did you run for, fellow?” said Sancho.
</p>
<p>
To which the young man replied, “Señor, it was to avoid answering
all the questions officers of justice put.”
</p>
<p>
“What are you by trade?”
</p>
<p>
“A weaver.”
</p>
<p>
“And what do you weave?”
</p>
<p>
“Lance heads, with your worship’s good leave.”
</p>
<p>
“You’re facetious with me! You plume yourself on being a wag?
Very good; and where were you going just now?”
</p>
<p>
“To take the air, señor.”
</p>
<p>
“And where does one take the air in this island?”
</p>
<p>
“Where it blows.”
</p>
<p>
“Good! your answers are very much to the point; you are a smart
youth; but take notice that I am the air, and that I blow upon you
a-stern, and send you to gaol. Ho there! lay hold of him and take him off;
I’ll make him sleep there to-night without air.”
</p>
<p>
“By God,” said the young man, “your worship will make me
sleep in gaol just as soon as make me king.”
</p>
<p>
“Why shan’t I make thee sleep in gaol?” said Sancho.
“Have I not the power to arrest thee and release thee whenever I
like?”
</p>
<p>
“All the power your worship has,” said the young man, “won’t
be able to make me sleep in gaol.”
</p>
<p>
“How? not able!” said Sancho; “take him away at once
where he’ll see his mistake with his own eyes, even if the gaoler is
willing to exert his interested generosity on his behalf; for I’ll
lay a penalty of two thousand ducats on him if he allows him to stir a
step from the prison.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s ridiculous,” said the young man; “the fact
is, all the men on earth will not make me sleep in prison.”
</p>
<p>
“Tell me, you devil,” said Sancho, “have you got any
angel that will deliver you, and take off the irons I am going to order
them to put upon you?”
</p>
<p>
“Now, señor governor,” said the young man in a sprightly
manner, “let us be reasonable and come to the point. Granted your
worship may order me to be taken to prison, and to have irons and chains
put on me, and to be shut up in a cell, and may lay heavy penalties on the
gaoler if he lets me out, and that he obeys your orders; still, if I don’t
choose to sleep, and choose to remain awake all night without closing an
eye, will your worship with all your power be able to make me sleep if I
don’t choose?”
</p>
<p>
“No, truly,” said the secretary, “and the fellow has
made his point.”
</p>
<p>
“So then,” said Sancho, “it would be entirely of your
own choice you would keep from sleeping; not in opposition to my will?”
</p>
<p>
“No, señor,” said the youth, “certainly not.”
</p>
<p>
“Well then, go, and God be with you,” said Sancho; “be
off home to sleep, and God give you sound sleep, for I don’t want to
rob you of it; but for the future, let me advise you don’t joke with
the authorities, because you may come across someone who will bring down
the joke on your own skull.”
</p>
<p>
The young man went his way, and the governor continued his round, and
shortly afterwards two tipstaffs came up with a man in custody, and said,
“Señor governor, this person, who seems to be a man, is not so, but
a woman, and not an ill-favoured one, in man’s clothes.” They
raised two or three lanterns to her face, and by their light they
distinguished the features of a woman to all appearance of the age of
sixteen or a little more, with her hair gathered into a gold and green
silk net, and fair as a thousand pearls. They scanned her from head to
foot, and observed that she had on red silk stockings with garters of
white taffety bordered with gold and pearl; her breeches were of green and
gold stuff, and under an open jacket or jerkin of the same she wore a
doublet of the finest white and gold cloth; her shoes were white and such
as men wear; she carried no sword at her belt, but only a richly
ornamented dagger, and on her fingers she had several handsome rings. In
short, the girl seemed fair to look at in the eyes of all, and none of
those who beheld her knew her, the people of the town said they could not
imagine who she was, and those who were in on the secret of the jokes that
were to be practised upon Sancho were the ones who were most surprised,
for this incident or discovery had not been arranged by them; and they
watched anxiously to see how the affair would end.
</p>
<p>
Sancho was fascinated by the girl’s beauty, and he asked her who she
was, where she was going, and what had induced her to dress herself in
that garb. She with her eyes fixed on the ground answered in modest
confusion, “I cannot tell you, señor, before so many people what it
is of such consequence to me to have kept secret; one thing I wish to be
known, that I am no thief or evildoer, but only an unhappy maiden whom the
power of jealousy has led to break through the respect that is due to
modesty.”
</p>
<p>
Hearing this the majordomo said to Sancho, “Make the people stand
back, señor governor, that this lady may say what she wishes with less
embarrassment.”
</p>
<p>
Sancho gave the order, and all except the majordomo, the head-carver, and
the secretary fell back. Finding herself then in the presence of no more,
the damsel went on to say, “I am the daughter, sirs, of Pedro Perez
Mazorca, the wool-farmer of this town, who is in the habit of coming very
often to my father’s house.”
</p>
<p>
“That won’t do, señora,” said the majordomo; “for
I know Pedro Perez very well, and I know he has no child at all, either
son or daughter; and besides, though you say he is your father, you add
then that he comes very often to your father’s house.”
</p>
<p>
“I had already noticed that,” said Sancho.
</p>
<p>
“I am confused just now, sirs,” said the damsel, “and I
don’t know what I am saying; but the truth is that I am the daughter
of Diego de la Llana, whom you must all know.”
</p>
<p>
“Ay, that will do,” said the majordomo; “for I know
Diego de la Llana, and know that he is a gentleman of position and a rich
man, and that he has a son and a daughter, and that since he was left a
widower nobody in all this town can speak of having seen his daughter’s
face; for he keeps her so closely shut up that he does not give even the
sun a chance of seeing her; and for all that report says she is extremely
beautiful.”
</p>
<p>
“It is true,” said the damsel, “and I am that daughter;
whether report lies or not as to my beauty, you, sirs, will have decided
by this time, as you have seen me;” and with this she began to weep
bitterly.
</p>
<p>
On seeing this the secretary leant over to the head-carver’s ear,
and said to him in a low voice, “Something serious has no doubt
happened this poor maiden, that she goes wandering from home in such a
dress and at such an hour, and one of her rank too.” “There
can be no doubt about it,” returned the carver, “and moreover
her tears confirm your suspicion.” Sancho gave her the best comfort
he could, and entreated her to tell them without any fear what had
happened her, as they would all earnestly and by every means in their
power endeavour to relieve her.
</p>
<p>
“The fact is, sirs,” said she, “that my father has kept
me shut up these ten years, for so long is it since the earth received my
mother. Mass is said at home in a sumptuous chapel, and all this time I
have seen but the sun in the heaven by day, and the moon and the stars by
night; nor do I know what streets are like, or plazas, or churches, or
even men, except my father and a brother I have, and Pedro Perez the
wool-farmer; whom, because he came frequently to our house, I took it into
my head to call my father, to avoid naming my own. This seclusion and the
restrictions laid upon my going out, were it only to church, have been
keeping me unhappy for many a day and month past; I longed to see the
world, or at least the town where I was born, and it did not seem to me
that this wish was inconsistent with the respect maidens of good quality
should have for themselves. When I heard them talking of bull-fights
taking place, and of javelin games, and of acting plays, I asked my
brother, who is a year younger than myself, to tell me what sort of things
these were, and many more that I had never seen; he explained them to me
as well as he could, but the only effect was to kindle in me a still
stronger desire to see them. At last, to cut short the story of my ruin, I
begged and entreated my brother—O that I had never made such an
entreaty—” And once more she gave way to a burst of weeping.
</p>
<p>
“Proceed, señora,” said the majordomo, “and finish your
story of what has happened to you, for your words and tears are keeping us
all in suspense.”
</p>
<p>
“I have but little more to say, though many a tear to shed,”
said the damsel; “for ill-placed desires can only be paid for in
some such way.”
</p>
<p>
The maiden’s beauty had made a deep impression on the head-carver’s
heart, and he again raised his lantern for another look at her, and
thought they were not tears she was shedding, but seed-pearl or dew of the
meadow, nay, he exalted them still higher, and made Oriental pearls of
them, and fervently hoped her misfortune might not be so great a one as
her tears and sobs seemed to indicate. The governor was losing patience at
the length of time the girl was taking to tell her story, and told her not
to keep them waiting any longer; for it was late, and there still remained
a good deal of the town to be gone over.
</p>
<p>
She, with broken sobs and half-suppressed sighs, went on to say, “My
misfortune, my misadventure, is simply this, that I entreated my brother
to dress me up as a man in a suit of his clothes, and take me some night,
when our father was asleep, to see the whole town; he, overcome by my
entreaties, consented, and dressing me in this suit and himself in clothes
of mine that fitted him as if made for him (for he has not a hair on his
chin, and might pass for a very beautiful young girl), to-night, about an
hour ago, more or less, we left the house, and guided by our youthful and
foolish impulse we made the circuit of the whole town, and then, as we
were about to return home, we saw a great troop of people coming, and my
brother said to me, ‘Sister, this must be the round, stir your feet
and put wings to them, and follow me as fast as you can, lest they
recognise us, for that would be a bad business for us;’ and so
saying he turned about and began, I cannot say to run but to fly; in less
than six paces I fell from fright, and then the officer of justice came up
and carried me before your worships, where I find myself put to shame
before all these people as whimsical and vicious.”
</p>
<p>
“So then, señora,” said Sancho, “no other mishap has
befallen you, nor was it jealousy that made you leave home, as you said at
the beginning of your story?”
</p>
<p>
“Nothing has happened me,” said she, “nor was it
jealousy that brought me out, but merely a longing to see the world, which
did not go beyond seeing the streets of this town.”
</p>
<p>
The appearance of the tipstaffs with her brother in custody, whom one of
them had overtaken as he ran away from his sister, now fully confirmed the
truth of what the damsel said. He had nothing on but a rich petticoat and
a short blue damask cloak with fine gold lace, and his head was uncovered
and adorned only with its own hair, which looked like rings of gold, so
bright and curly was it. The governor, the majordomo, and the carver went
aside with him, and, unheard by his sister, asked him how he came to be in
that dress, and he with no less shame and embarrassment told exactly the
same story as his sister, to the great delight of the enamoured carver;
the governor, however, said to them, “In truth, young lady and
gentleman, this has been a very childish affair, and to explain your folly
and rashness there was no necessity for all this delay and all these tears
and sighs; for if you had said we are so-and-so, and we escaped from our
father’s house in this way in order to ramble about, out of mere
curiosity and with no other object, there would have been an end of the
matter, and none of these little sobs and tears and all the rest of it.”
</p>
<p>
“That is true,” said the damsel, “but you see the
confusion I was in was so great it did not let me behave as I ought.”
</p>
<p>
“No harm has been done,” said Sancho; “come, we will
leave you at your father’s house; perhaps they will not have missed
you; and another time don’t be so childish or eager to see the
world; for a respectable damsel should have a broken leg and keep at home;
and the woman and the hen by gadding about are soon lost; and she who is
eager to see is also eager to be seen; I say no more.”
</p>
<p>
The youth thanked the governor for his kind offer to take them home, and
they directed their steps towards the house, which was not far off. On
reaching it the youth threw a pebble up at a grating, and immediately a
woman-servant who was waiting for them came down and opened the door to
them, and they went in, leaving the party marvelling as much at their
grace and beauty as at the fancy they had for seeing the world by night
and without quitting the village; which, however, they set down to their
youth.

The head-carver was left with a heart pierced through and through, and he
made up his mind on the spot to demand the damsel in marriage of her
father on the morrow, making sure she would not be refused him as he was a
servant of the duke’s; and even to Sancho ideas and schemes of
marrying the youth to his daughter Sanchica suggested themselves, and he
resolved to open the negotiation at the proper season, persuading himself
that no husband could be refused to a governor’s daughter. And so
the night’s round came to an end, and a couple of days later the
government, whereby all his plans were overthrown and swept away, as will
be seen farther on.

Cide Hamete, the painstaking investigator of the minute points of this
veracious history, says that when Doña Rodriguez left her own room to go
to Don Quixote’s, another duenna who slept with her observed her,
and as all duennas are fond of prying, listening, and sniffing, she
followed her so silently that the good Rodriguez never perceived it; and
as soon as the duenna saw her enter Don Quixote’s room, not to fail
in a duenna’s invariable practice of tattling, she hurried off that
instant to report to the duchess how Doña Rodriguez was closeted with Don
Quixote. The duchess told the duke, and asked him to let her and
Altisidora go and see what the said duenna wanted with Don Quixote. The
duke gave them leave, and the pair cautiously and quietly crept to the
door of the room and posted themselves so close to it that they could hear
all that was said inside. But when the duchess heard how the Rodriguez had
made public the Aranjuez of her issues she could not restrain herself, nor
Altisidora either; and so, filled with rage and thirsting for vengeance,
they burst into the room and tormented Don Quixote and flogged the duenna
in the manner already described; for indignities offered to their charms
and self-esteem mightily provoke the anger of women and make them eager
for revenge. The duchess told the duke what had happened, and he was much
amused by it; and she, in pursuance of her design of making merry and
diverting herself with Don Quixote, despatched the page who had played the
part of Dulcinea in the negotiations for her disenchantment (which Sancho
Panza in the cares of government had forgotten all about) to Teresa Panza
his wife with her husband’s letter and another from herself, and
also a great string of fine coral beads as a present.
</p>
<p>
Now the history says this page was very sharp and quick-witted; and eager
to serve his lord and lady he set off very willingly for Sancho’s
village. Before he entered it he observed a number of women washing in a
brook, and asked them if they could tell him whether there lived there a
woman of the name of Teresa Panza, wife of one Sancho Panza, squire to a
knight called Don Quixote of La Mancha. At the question a young girl who
was washing stood up and said, “Teresa Panza is my mother, and that
Sancho is my father, and that knight is our master.”
</p>
<p>
“Well then, miss,” said the page, “come and show me
where your mother is, for I bring her a letter and a present from your
father.”
</p>
<p>
“That I will with all my heart, señor,” said the girl, who
seemed to be about fourteen, more or less; and leaving the clothes she was
washing to one of her companions, and without putting anything on her head
or feet, for she was bare-legged and had her hair hanging about her, away
she skipped in front of the page’s horse, saying, “Come, your
worship, our house is at the entrance of the town, and my mother is there,
sorrowful enough at not having had any news of my father this ever so
long.”
</p>
<p>
“Well,” said the page, “I am bringing her such good news
that she will have reason to thank God.”
</p>
<p>
And then, skipping, running, and capering, the girl reached the town, but
before going into the house she called out at the door, “Come out,
mother Teresa, come out, come out; here’s a gentleman with letters
and other things from my good father.” At these words her mother
Teresa Panza came out spinning a bundle of flax, in a grey petticoat (so
short was it one would have fancied “they to her shame had cut it
short”), a grey bodice of the same stuff, and a smock. She was not
very old, though plainly past forty, strong, healthy, vigorous, and
sun-dried; and seeing her daughter and the page on horseback, she
exclaimed, “What’s this, child? What gentleman is this?”
</p>
<p>
“A servant of my lady, Doña Teresa Panza,” replied the page;
and suiting the action to the word he flung himself off his horse, and
with great humility advanced to kneel before the lady Teresa, saying,
“Let me kiss your hand, Señora Doña Teresa, as the lawful and only
wife of Señor Don Sancho Panza, rightful governor of the island of
Barataria.”
</p>
<p>
“Ah, señor, get up, do that,” said Teresa; “for I’m
not a bit of a court lady, but only a poor country woman, the daughter of
a clodcrusher, and the wife of a squire-errant and not of any governor at
all.”
</p>
<p>
“You are,” said the page, “the most worthy wife of a
most arch-worthy governor; and as a proof of what I say accept this letter
and this present;” and at the same time he took out of his pocket a
string of coral beads with gold clasps, and placed it on her neck, and
said, “This letter is from his lordship the governor, and the other
as well as these coral beads from my lady the duchess, who sends me to
your worship.”
</p>
<p>
Teresa stood lost in astonishment, and her daughter just as much, and the
girl said, “May I die but our master Don Quixote’s at the
bottom of this; he must have given father the government or county he so
often promised him.”
</p>
<p>
“That is the truth,” said the page; “for it is through
Señor Don Quixote that Señor Sancho is now governor of the island of
Barataria, as will be seen by this letter.”
</p>
<p>
“Will your worship read it to me, noble sir?” said Teresa;
“for though I can spin I can’t read, not a scrap.”
</p>
<p>
“Nor I either,” said Sanchica; “but wait a bit, and I’ll
go and fetch someone who can read it, either the curate himself or the
bachelor Samson Carrasco, and they’ll come gladly to hear any news
of my father.”
</p>
<p>
“There is no need to fetch anybody,” said the page; “for
though I can’t spin I can read, and I’ll read it;” and
so he read it through, but as it has been already given it is not inserted
here; and then he took out the other one from the duchess, which ran as
follows:
</p>
<p class="letter">
Friend Teresa,—Your husband Sancho’s good qualities, of heart as
well as of head, induced and compelled me to request my husband the duke to
give him the government of one of his many islands. I am told he governs like a
gerfalcon, of which I am very glad, and my lord the duke, of course, also; and
I am very thankful to heaven that I have not made a mistake in choosing him for
that same government; for I would have Señora Teresa know that a good governor
is hard to find in this world and may God make me as good as Sancho’s way
of governing. Herewith I send you, my dear, a string of coral beads with gold
clasps; I wish they were Oriental pearls; but “he who gives thee a bone
does not wish to see thee dead;” a time will come when we shall become
acquainted and meet one another, but God knows the future. Commend me to your
daughter Sanchica, and tell her from me to hold herself in readiness, for I
mean to make a high match for her when she least expects it. They tell me there
are big acorns in your village; send me a couple of dozen or so, and I shall
value them greatly as coming from your hand; and write to me at length to
assure me of your health and well-being; and if there be anything you stand in
need of, it is but to open your mouth, and that shall be the measure; and so
God keep you.
</p>
<p class="right">
From this place.<br>
Your loving friend,<br>
THE DUCHESS.
</p>
<p>
“Ah, what a good, plain, lowly lady!” said Teresa when she
heard the letter; “that I may be buried with ladies of that sort,
and not the gentlewomen we have in this town, that fancy because they are
gentlewomen the wind must not touch them, and go to church with as much
airs as if they were queens, no less, and seem to think they are disgraced
if they look at a farmer’s wife! And see here how this good lady,
for all she’s a duchess, calls me ‘friend,’ and treats
me as if I was her equal—and equal may I see her with the tallest
church-tower in La Mancha! And as for the acorns, señor, I’ll send
her ladyship a peck and such big ones that one might come to see them as a
show and a wonder. And now, Sanchica, see that the gentleman is
comfortable; put up his horse, and get some eggs out of the stable, and
cut plenty of bacon, and let’s give him his dinner like a prince;
for the good news he has brought, and his own bonny face deserve it all;
and meanwhile I’ll run out and give the neighbours the news of our
good luck, and father curate, and Master Nicholas the barber, who are and
always have been such friends of thy father’s.”
</p>
<p>
“That I will, mother,” said Sanchica; “but mind, you
must give me half of that string; for I don’t think my lady the
duchess could have been so stupid as to send it all to you.”
</p>
<p>
“It is all for thee, my child,” said Teresa; “but let me
wear it round my neck for a few days; for verily it seems to make my heart
glad.”
</p>
<p>
“You will be glad too,” said the page, “when you see the
bundle there is in this portmanteau, for it is a suit of the finest cloth,
that the governor only wore one day out hunting and now sends, all for
Señora Sanchica.”
</p>
<p>
“May he live a thousand years,” said Sanchica, “and the
bearer as many, nay two thousand, if needful.”
</p>
<p>
With this Teresa hurried out of the house with the letters, and with the
string of beads round her neck, and went along thrumming the letters as if
they were a tambourine, and by chance coming across the curate and Samson
Carrasco she began capering and saying, “None of us poor now, faith!
We’ve got a little government! Ay, let the finest fine lady tackle
me, and I’ll give her a setting down!”
</p>
<p>
“What’s all this, Teresa Panza,” said they; “what
madness is this, and what papers are those?”
</p>
<p>
“The madness is only this,” said she, “that these are
the letters of duchesses and governors, and these I have on my neck are
fine coral beads, with ave-marias and paternosters of beaten gold, and I
am a governess.”
</p>
<p>
“God help us,” said the curate, “we don’t
understand you, Teresa, or know what you are talking about.”
</p>
<p>
“There, you may see it yourselves,” said Teresa, and she
handed them the letters.
</p>
<p>
The curate read them out for Samson Carrasco to hear, and Samson and he
regarded one another with looks of astonishment at what they had read, and
the bachelor asked who had brought the letters. Teresa in reply bade them
come with her to her house and they would see the messenger, a most
elegant youth, who had brought another present which was worth as much
more. The curate took the coral beads from her neck and examined them
again and again, and having satisfied himself as to their fineness he fell
to wondering afresh, and said, “By the gown I wear I don’t
know what to say or think of these letters and presents; on the one hand I
can see and feel the fineness of these coral beads, and on the other I
read how a duchess sends to beg for a couple of dozen of acorns.”
</p>
<p>
“Square that if you can,” said Carrasco; “well, let’s
go and see the messenger, and from him we’ll learn something about
this mystery that has turned up.”
</p>
<p>
They did so, and Teresa returned with them. They found the page sifting a
little barley for his horse, and Sanchica cutting a rasher of bacon to be
paved with eggs for his dinner. His looks and his handsome apparel pleased
them both greatly; and after they had saluted him courteously, and he
them, Samson begged him to give them his news, as well of Don Quixote as
of Sancho Panza, for, he said, though they had read the letters from
Sancho and her ladyship the duchess, they were still puzzled and could not
make out what was meant by Sancho’s government, and above all of an
island, when all or most of those in the Mediterranean belonged to his
Majesty.
</p>
<p>
To this the page replied, “As to Señor Sancho Panza’s being a
governor there is no doubt whatever; but whether it is an island or not
that he governs, with that I have nothing to do; suffice it that it is a
town of more than a thousand inhabitants; with regard to the acorns I may
tell you my lady the duchess is so unpretending and unassuming that, not
to speak of sending to beg for acorns from a peasant woman, she has been
known to send to ask for the loan of a comb from one of her neighbours;
for I would have your worships know that the ladies of Aragon, though they
are just as illustrious, are not so punctilious and haughty as the
Castilian ladies; they treat people with greater familiarity.”
</p>
<p>
In the middle of this conversation Sanchica came in with her skirt full of
eggs, and said she to the page, “Tell me, señor, does my father wear
trunk-hose since he has been governor?”
</p>
<p>
“I have not noticed,” said the page; “but no doubt he
wears them.”
</p>
<p>
“Ah! my God!” said Sanchica, “what a sight it must be to
see my father in tights! Isn’t it odd that ever since I was born I
have had a longing to see my father in trunk-hose?”
</p>
<p>
“As things go you will see that if you live,” said the page;
“by God he is in the way to take the road with a sunshade if the
government only lasts him two months more.”
</p>
<p>
The curate and the bachelor could see plainly enough that the page spoke
in a waggish vein; but the fineness of the coral beads, and the hunting
suit that Sancho sent (for Teresa had already shown it to them) did away
with the impression; and they could not help laughing at Sanchica’s
wish, and still more when Teresa said, “Señor curate, look about if
there’s anybody here going to Madrid or Toledo, to buy me a hooped
petticoat, a proper fashionable one of the best quality; for indeed and
indeed I must do honour to my husband’s government as well as I can;
nay, if I am put to it and have to, I’ll go to Court and set a coach
like all the world; for she who has a governor for her husband may very
well have one and keep one.”
</p>
<p>
“And why not, mother!” said Sanchica; “would to God it
were to-day instead of to-morrow, even though they were to say when they
saw me seated in the coach with my mother, ‘See that rubbish, that
garlic-stuffed fellow’s daughter, how she goes stretched at her ease
in a coach as if she was a she-pope!’ But let them tramp through the
mud, and let me go in my coach with my feet off the ground. Bad luck to
backbiters all over the world; ‘let me go warm and the people may
laugh.’ Do I say right, mother?”
</p>
<p>
“To be sure you do, my child,” said Teresa; “and all
this good luck, and even more, my good Sancho foretold me; and thou wilt
see, my daughter, he won’t stop till he has made me a countess; for
to make a beginning is everything in luck; and as I have heard thy good
father say many a time (for besides being thy father he’s the father
of proverbs too), ‘When they offer thee a heifer, run with a halter;
when they offer thee a government, take it; when they would give thee a
county, seize it; when they say, “Here, here!” to thee with
something good, swallow it.’ Oh no! go to sleep, and don’t
answer the strokes of good fortune and the lucky chances that are knocking
at the door of your house!”
</p>
<p>
“And what do I care,” added Sanchica, “whether anybody
says when he sees me holding my head up, ‘The dog saw himself in
hempen breeches,’ and the rest of it?”
</p>
<p>
Hearing this the curate said, “I do believe that all this family of
the Panzas are born with a sackful of proverbs in their insides, every one
of them; I never saw one of them that does not pour them out at all times
and on all occasions.”
</p>
<p>
“That is true,” said the page, “for Señor Governor
Sancho utters them at every turn; and though a great many of them are not
to the purpose, still they amuse one, and my lady the duchess and the duke
praise them highly.”
</p>
<p>
“Then you still maintain that all this about Sancho’s
government is true, señor,” said the bachelor, “and that there
actually is a duchess who sends him presents and writes to him? Because
we, although we have handled the present and read the letters, don’t
believe it and suspect it to be something in the line of our
fellow-townsman Don Quixote, who fancies that everything is done by
enchantment; and for this reason I am almost ready to say that I’d
like to touch and feel your worship to see whether you are a mere
ambassador of the imagination or a man of flesh and blood.”
</p>
<p>
“All I know, sirs,” replied the page, “is that I am a
real ambassador, and that Señor Sancho Panza is governor as a matter of
fact, and that my lord and lady the duke and duchess can give, and have
given him this same government, and that I have heard it said Sancho Panza
bears himself very stoutly therein; whether there be any enchantment in
all this or not, it is for your worships to settle between you; for that’s
all I know by the oath I swear, and that is by the life of my parents whom
I have still alive, and love dearly.”
</p>
<p>
“It may be so,” said the bachelor; “but <i>dubitat
Augustinus</i>.”
</p>
<p>
“Doubt who will,” said the page; “what I have told you
is the truth, and that will always rise above falsehood as oil above
water; if not <i>operibus credite, et non verbis</i>. Let one of you come with
me, and he will see with his eyes what he does not believe with his ears.”
</p>
<p>
“It’s for me to make that trip,” said Sanchica; “take
me with you, señor, behind you on your horse; for I’ll go with all
my heart to see my father.”
</p>
<p>
“Governors’ daughters,” said the page, “must not
travel along the roads alone, but accompanied by coaches and litters and a
great number of attendants.”
</p>
<p>
“By God,” said Sanchica, “I can go just as well mounted
on a she-ass as in a coach; what a dainty lass you must take me for!”
</p>
<p>
“Hush, girl,” said Teresa; “you don’t know what
you’re talking about; the gentleman is quite right, for ‘as
the time so the behaviour;’ when it was Sancho it was ‘Sancha;’
when it is governor it’s ‘señora;’ I don’t know if
I’m right.”
</p>
<p>
“Señora Teresa says more than she is aware of,” said the page;
“and now give me something to eat and let me go at once, for I mean
to return this evening.”
</p>
<p>
“Come and do penance with me,” said the curate at this;
“for Señora Teresa has more will than means to serve so worthy a
guest.”
</p>
<p>
The page refused, but had to consent at last for his own sake; and the
curate took him home with him very gladly, in order to have an opportunity
of questioning him at leisure about Don Quixote and his doings. The
bachelor offered to write the letters in reply for Teresa; but she did not
care to let him mix himself up in her affairs, for she thought him
somewhat given to joking; and so she gave a cake and a couple of eggs to a
young acolyte who was a penman, and he wrote for her two letters, one for
her husband and the other for the duchess, dictated out of her own head,
which are not the worst inserted in this great history, as will be seen
farther on.

<p>
Day came after the night of the governor’s round; a night which the
head-carver passed without sleeping, so were his thoughts of the face and
air and beauty of the disguised damsel, while the majordomo spent what was
left of it in writing an account to his lord and lady of all Sancho said
and did, being as much amazed at his sayings as at his doings, for there
was a mixture of shrewdness and simplicity in all his words and deeds. The
señor governor got up, and by Doctor Pedro Recio’s directions they
made him break his fast on a little conserve and four sups of cold water,
which Sancho would have readily exchanged for a piece of bread and a bunch
of grapes; but seeing there was no help for it, he submitted with no
little sorrow of heart and discomfort of stomach; Pedro Recio having
persuaded him that light and delicate diet enlivened the wits, and that
was what was most essential for persons placed in command and in
responsible situations, where they have to employ not only the bodily
powers but those of the mind also.
</p>
<p>
By means of this sophistry Sancho was made to endure hunger, and hunger so
keen that in his heart he cursed the government, and even him who had
given it to him; however, with his hunger and his conserve he undertook to
deliver judgments that day, and the first thing that came before him was a
question that was submitted to him by a stranger, in the presence of the
majordomo and the other attendants, and it was in these words: “Señor,
a large river separated two districts of one and the same lordship—will
your worship please to pay attention, for the case is an important and a
rather knotty one? Well then, on this river there was a bridge, and at one
end of it a gallows, and a sort of tribunal, where four judges commonly
sat to administer the law which the lord of river, bridge and the lordship
had enacted, and which was to this effect, ‘If anyone crosses by
this bridge from one side to the other he shall declare on oath where he
is going to and with what object; and if he swears truly, he shall be
allowed to pass, but if falsely, he shall be put to death for it by
hanging on the gallows erected there, without any remission.’ Though
the law and its severe penalty were known, many persons crossed, but in
their declarations it was easy to see at once they were telling the truth,
and the judges let them pass free. It happened, however, that one man,
when they came to take his declaration, swore and said that by the oath he
took he was going to die upon that gallows that stood there, and nothing
else. The judges held a consultation over the oath, and they said, ‘If
we let this man pass free he has sworn falsely, and by the law he ought to
die; but if we hang him, as he swore he was going to die on that gallows,
and therefore swore the truth, by the same law he ought to go free.’
It is asked of your worship, señor governor, what are the judges to do
with this man? For they are still in doubt and perplexity; and having
heard of your worship’s acute and exalted intellect, they have sent
me to entreat your worship on their behalf to give your opinion on this
very intricate and puzzling case.”
</p>
<p>
To this Sancho made answer, “Indeed those gentlemen the judges that
send you to me might have spared themselves the trouble, for I have more
of the obtuse than the acute in me; but repeat the case over again, so
that I may understand it, and then perhaps I may be able to hit the point.”
</p>
<p>
The querist repeated again and again what he had said before, and then
Sancho said, “It seems to me I can set the matter right in a moment,
and in this way; the man swears that he is going to die upon the gallows;
but if he dies upon it, he has sworn the truth, and by the law enacted
deserves to go free and pass over the bridge; but if they don’t hang
him, then he has sworn falsely, and by the same law deserves to be hanged.”
</p>
<p>
“It is as the señor governor says,” said the messenger;
“and as regards a complete comprehension of the case, there is
nothing left to desire or hesitate about.”
</p>
<p>
“Well then I say,” said Sancho, “that of this man they
should let pass the part that has sworn truly, and hang the part that has
lied; and in this way the conditions of the passage will be fully complied
with.”
</p>
<p>
“But then, señor governor,” replied the querist, “the
man will have to be divided into two parts; and if he is divided of course
he will die; and so none of the requirements of the law will be carried
out, and it is absolutely necessary to comply with it.”
</p>
<p>
“Look here, my good sir,” said Sancho; “either I’m
a numskull or else there is the same reason for this passenger dying as
for his living and passing over the bridge; for if the truth saves him the
falsehood equally condemns him; and that being the case it is my opinion
you should say to the gentlemen who sent you to me that as the arguments
for condemning him and for absolving him are exactly balanced, they should
let him pass freely, as it is always more praiseworthy to do good than to
do evil; this I would give signed with my name if I knew how to sign; and
what I have said in this case is not out of my own head, but one of the
many precepts my master Don Quixote gave me the night before I left to
become governor of this island, that came into my mind, and it was this,
that when there was any doubt about the justice of a case I should lean to
mercy; and it is God’s will that I should recollect it now, for it
fits this case as if it was made for it.”
</p>
<p>
“That is true,” said the majordomo; “and I maintain that
Lycurgus himself, who gave laws to the Lacedemonians, could not have
pronounced a better decision than the great Panza has given; let the
morning’s audience close with this, and I will see that the señor
governor has dinner entirely to his liking.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s all I ask for—fair play,” said Sancho;
“give me my dinner, and then let it rain cases and questions on me,
and I’ll despatch them in a twinkling.”
</p>
<p>
The majordomo kept his word, for he felt it against his conscience to kill
so wise a governor by hunger; particularly as he intended to have done
with him that same night, playing off the last joke he was commissioned to
practise upon him.
</p>
<p>
It came to pass, then, that after he had dined that day, in opposition to
the rules and aphorisms of Doctor Tirteafuera, as they were taking away
the cloth there came a courier with a letter from Don Quixote for the
governor. Sancho ordered the secretary to read it to himself, and if there
was nothing in it that demanded secrecy to read it aloud. The secretary
did so, and after he had skimmed the contents he said, “It may well
be read aloud, for what Señor Don Quixote writes to your worship deserves
to be printed or written in letters of gold, and it is as follows.”

<p class="center">
DON QUIXOTE OF LA MANCHA’S LETTER TO SANCHO PANZA, GOVERNOR OF THE
ISLAND OF BARATARIA.
</p>
<p class="letter">
When I was expecting to hear of thy stupidities and blunders, friend Sancho, I
have received intelligence of thy displays of good sense, for which I give
special thanks to heaven that can raise the poor from the dunghill and of fools
to make wise men. They tell me thou dost govern as if thou wert a man, and art
a man as if thou wert a beast, so great is the humility wherewith thou dost
comport thyself. But I would have thee bear in mind, Sancho, that very often it
is fitting and necessary for the authority of office to resist the humility of
the heart; for the seemly array of one who is invested with grave duties should
be such as they require and not measured by what his own humble tastes may lead
him to prefer. Dress well; a stick dressed up does not look like a stick; I do
not say thou shouldst wear trinkets or fine raiment, or that being a judge thou
shouldst dress like a soldier, but that thou shouldst array thyself in the
apparel thy office requires, and that at the same time it be neat and handsome.
To win the good-will of the people thou governest there are two things, among
others, that thou must do; one is to be civil to all (this, however, I told
thee before), and the other to take care that food be abundant, for there is
nothing that vexes the heart of the poor more than hunger and high prices. Make
not many proclamations; but those thou makest take care that they be good ones,
and above all that they be observed and carried out; for proclamations that are
not observed are the same as if they did not exist; nay, they encourage the
idea that the prince who had the wisdom and authority to make them had not the
power to enforce them; and laws that threaten and are not enforced come to be
like the log, the king of the frogs, that frightened them at first, but that in
time they despised and mounted upon. Be a father to virtue and a stepfather to
vice. Be not always strict, nor yet always lenient, but observe a mean between
these two extremes, for in that is the aim of wisdom. Visit the gaols, the
slaughter-houses, and the market-places; for the presence of the governor is of
great importance in such places; it comforts the prisoners who are in hopes of
a speedy release, it is the bugbear of the butchers who have then to give just
weight, and it is the terror of the market-women for the same reason. Let it
not be seen that thou art (even if perchance thou art, which I do not believe)
covetous, a follower of women, or a glutton; for when the people and those that
have dealings with thee become aware of thy special weakness they will bring
their batteries to bear upon thee in that quarter, till they have brought thee
down to the depths of perdition. Consider and reconsider, con and con over
again the advices and the instructions I gave thee before thy departure hence
to thy government, and thou wilt see that in them, if thou dost follow them,
thou hast a help at hand that will lighten for thee the troubles and
difficulties that beset governors at every step. Write to thy lord and lady and
show thyself grateful to them, for ingratitude is the daughter of pride, and
one of the greatest sins we know of; and he who is grateful to those who have
been good to him shows that he will be so to God also who has bestowed and
still bestows so many blessings upon him.<br>
    My lady the duchess sent off a messenger with thy suit and another present
to thy wife Teresa Panza; we expect the answer every moment. I have been a
little indisposed through a certain scratching I came in for, not very much to
the benefit of my nose; but it was nothing; for if there are enchanters who
maltreat me, there are also some who defend me. Let me know if the majordomo
who is with thee had any share in the Trifaldi performance, as thou didst
suspect; and keep me informed of everything that happens thee, as the distance
is so short; all the more as I am thinking of giving over very shortly this
idle life I am now leading, for I was not born for it. A thing has occurred to
me which I am inclined to think will put me out of favour with the duke and
duchess; but though I am sorry for it I do not care, for after all I must obey
my calling rather than their pleasure, in accordance with the common saying,
<i>amicus Plato, sed magis amica veritas</i>. I quote this Latin to thee
because I conclude that since thou hast been a governor thou wilt have learned
it. Adieu; God keep thee from being an object of pity to anyone.
</p>
<p class="right">
Thy friend,<br>
DON QUIXOTE OF LA MANCHA.
</p>
<p>
Sancho listened to the letter with great attention, and it was praised and
considered wise by all who heard it; he then rose up from table, and
calling his secretary shut himself in with him in his own room, and
without putting it off any longer set about answering his master Don
Quixote at once; and he bade the secretary write down what he told him
without adding or suppressing anything, which he did, and the answer was
to the following effect.
</p>
<p class="center">
SANCHO PANZA’S LETTER TO DON QUIXOTE OF LA MANCHA.
</p>
<p class="letter">
The pressure of business is so great upon me that I have no time to scratch my
head or even to cut my nails; and I have them so long—God send a remedy
for it. I say this, master of my soul, that you may not be surprised if I have
not until now sent you word of how I fare, well or ill, in this government, in
which I am suffering more hunger than when we two were wandering through the
woods and wastes.<br>
    My lord the duke wrote to me the other day to warn me that certain spies had
got into this island to kill me; but up to the present I have not found out any
except a certain doctor who receives a salary in this town for killing all the
governors that come here; he is called Doctor Pedro Recio, and is from
Tirteafuera; so you see what a name he has to make me dread dying under his
hands. This doctor says of himself that he does not cure diseases when there
are any, but prevents them coming, and the medicines he uses are diet and more
diet until he brings one down to bare bones; as if leanness was not worse than
fever.<br>
    In short he is killing me with hunger, and I am dying myself of vexation; for
when I thought I was coming to this government to get my meat hot and my drink
cool, and take my ease between holland sheets on feather beds, I find I have
come to do penance as if I was a hermit; and as I don’t do it willingly I
suspect that in the end the devil will carry me off.<br>
    So far I have not handled any dues or taken any bribes, and I don’t know
what to think of it; for here they tell me that the governors that come to this
island, before entering it have plenty of money either given to them or lent to
them by the people of the town, and that this is the usual custom not only here
but with all who enter upon governments.<br>
    Last night going the rounds I came upon a fair damsel in man’s clothes,
and a brother of hers dressed as a woman; my head-carver has fallen in love
with the girl, and has in his own mind chosen her for a wife, so he says, and I
have chosen the youth for a son-in-law; to-day we are going to explain our
intentions to the father of the pair, who is one Diego de la Llana, a gentleman
and an old Christian as much as you please.<br>
    I have visited the market-places, as your worship advises me, and yesterday I
found a stall-keeper selling new hazel nuts and proved her to have mixed a
bushel of old empty rotten nuts with a bushel of new; I confiscated the whole
for the children of the charity-school, who will know how to distinguish them
well enough, and I sentenced her not to come into the market-place for a
fortnight; they told me I did bravely. I can tell your worship it is commonly
said in this town that there are no people worse than the market-women, for
they are all barefaced, unconscionable, and impudent, and I can well believe it
from what I have seen of them in other towns.<br>
    I am very glad my lady the duchess has written to my wife Teresa Panza and sent
her the present your worship speaks of; and I will strive to show myself
grateful when the time comes; kiss her hands for me, and tell her I say she has
not thrown it into a sack with a hole in it, as she will see in the end. I
should not like your worship to have any difference with my lord and lady; for
if you fall out with them it is plain it must do me harm; and as you give me
advice to be grateful it will not do for your worship not to be so yourself to
those who have shown you such kindness, and by whom you have been treated so
hospitably in their castle.<br>
    That about the scratching I don’t understand; but I suppose it must be
one of the ill-turns the wicked enchanters are always doing your worship; when
we meet I shall know all about it. I wish I could send your worship something;
but I don’t know what to send, unless it be some very curious clyster
pipes, to work with bladders, that they make in this island; but if the office
remains with me I’ll find out something to send, one way or another. If
my wife Teresa Panza writes to me, pay the postage and send me the letter, for
I have a very great desire to hear how my house and wife and children are going
on. And so, may God deliver your worship from evil-minded enchanters, and bring
me well and peacefully out of this government, which I doubt, for I expect to
take leave of it and my life together, from the way Doctor Pedro Recio treats
me.
</p>
<p class="right">
Your worship’s servant<br>
SANCHO PANZA THE GOVERNOR.
</p>
<p>
The secretary sealed the letter, and immediately dismissed the courier;
and those who were carrying on the joke against Sancho putting their heads
together arranged how he was to be dismissed from the government. Sancho
spent the afternoon in drawing up certain ordinances relating to the good
government of what he fancied the island; and he ordained that there were
to be no provision hucksters in the State, and that men might import wine
into it from any place they pleased, provided they declared the quarter it
came from, so that a price might be put upon it according to its quality,
reputation, and the estimation it was held in; and he that watered his
wine, or changed the name, was to forfeit his life for it. He reduced the
prices of all manner of shoes, boots, and stockings, but of shoes in
particular, as they seemed to him to run extravagantly high. He
established a fixed rate for servants’ wages, which were becoming
recklessly exorbitant. He laid extremely heavy penalties upon those who
sang lewd or loose songs either by day or night. He decreed that no blind
man should sing of any miracle in verse, unless he could produce authentic
evidence that it was true, for it was his opinion that most of those the
blind men sing are trumped up, to the detriment of the true ones. He
established and created an alguacil of the poor, not to harass them, but
to examine them and see whether they really were so; for many a sturdy
thief or drunkard goes about under cover of a make-believe crippled limb
or a sham sore. In a word, he made so many good rules that to this day
they are preserved there, and are called <i>The constitutions of the great
governor Sancho Panza</i>.

Cide Hamete relates that Don Quixote being now cured of his scratches felt
that the life he was leading in the castle was entirely inconsistent with
the order of chivalry he professed, so he determined to ask the duke and
duchess to permit him to take his departure for Saragossa, as the time of
the festival was now drawing near, and he hoped to win there the suit of
armour which is the prize at festivals of the sort. But one day at table
with the duke and duchess, just as he was about to carry his resolution
into effect and ask for their permission, lo and behold suddenly there
came in through the door of the great hall two women, as they afterwards
proved to be, draped in mourning from head to foot, one of whom
approaching Don Quixote flung herself at full length at his feet, pressing
her lips to them, and uttering moans so sad, so deep, and so doleful that
she put all who heard and saw her into a state of perplexity; and though
the duke and duchess supposed it must be some joke their servants were
playing off upon Don Quixote, still the earnest way the woman sighed and
moaned and wept puzzled them and made them feel uncertain, until Don
Quixote, touched with compassion, raised her up and made her unveil
herself and remove the mantle from her tearful face. She complied and
disclosed what no one could have ever anticipated, for she disclosed the
countenance of Doña Rodriguez, the duenna of the house; the other female
in mourning being her daughter, who had been made a fool of by the rich
farmer’s son. All who knew her were filled with astonishment, and
the duke and duchess more than any; for though they thought her a
simpleton and a weak creature, they did not think her capable of crazy
pranks. Doña Rodriguez, at length, turning to her master and mistress said
to them, “Will your excellences be pleased to permit me to speak to
this gentleman for a moment, for it is requisite I should do so in order
to get successfully out of the business in which the boldness of an
evil-minded clown has involved me?”
</p>
<p>
The duke said that for his part he gave her leave, and that she might
speak with Señor Don Quixote as much as she liked.
</p>
<p>
She then, turning to Don Quixote and addressing herself to him said,
“Some days since, valiant knight, I gave you an account of the
injustice and treachery of a wicked farmer to my dearly beloved daughter,
the unhappy damsel here before you, and you promised me to take her part
and right the wrong that has been done her; but now it has come to my
hearing that you are about to depart from this castle in quest of such
fair adventures as God may vouchsafe to you; therefore, before you take
the road, I would that you challenge this froward rustic, and compel him
to marry my daughter in fulfillment of the promise he gave her to become
her husband before he seduced her; for to expect that my lord the duke
will do me justice is to ask pears from the elm tree, for the reason I
stated privately to your worship; and so may our Lord grant you good
health and forsake us not.”
</p>
<p>
To these words Don Quixote replied very gravely and solemnly, “Worthy
duenna, check your tears, or rather dry them, and spare your sighs, for I
take it upon myself to obtain redress for your daughter, for whom it would
have been better not to have been so ready to believe lovers’
promises, which are for the most part quickly made and very slowly
performed; and so, with my lord the duke’s leave, I will at once go
in quest of this inhuman youth, and will find him out and challenge him
and slay him, if so be he refuses to keep his promised word; for the chief
object of my profession is to spare the humble and chastise the proud; I
mean, to help the distressed and destroy the oppressors.”
</p>
<p>
“There is no necessity,” said the duke, “for your
worship to take the trouble of seeking out the rustic of whom this worthy
duenna complains, nor is there any necessity, either, for asking my leave
to challenge him; for I admit him duly challenged, and will take care that
he is informed of the challenge, and accepts it, and comes to answer it in
person to this castle of mine, where I shall afford to both a fair field,
observing all the conditions which are usually and properly observed in
such trials, and observing too justice to both sides, as all princes who
offer a free field to combatants within the limits of their lordships are
bound to do.”
</p>
<p>
“Then with that assurance and your highness’s good leave,”
said Don Quixote, “I hereby for this once waive my privilege of
gentle blood, and come down and put myself on a level with the lowly birth
of the wrong-doer, making myself equal with him and enabling him to enter
into combat with me; and so, I challenge and defy him, though absent, on
the plea of his malfeasance in breaking faith with this poor damsel, who
was a maiden and now by his misdeed is none; and say that he shall fulfill
the promise he gave her to become her lawful husband, or else stake his
life upon the question.”
</p>
<p>
And then plucking off a glove he threw it down in the middle of the hall,
and the duke picked it up, saying, as he had said before, that he accepted
the challenge in the name of his vassal, and fixed six days thence as the
time, the courtyard of the castle as the place, and for arms the customary
ones of knights, lance and shield and full armour, with all the other
accessories, without trickery, guile, or charms of any sort, and examined
and passed by the judges of the field. “But first of all,” he
said, “it is requisite that this worthy duenna and unworthy damsel
should place their claim for justice in the hands of Don Quixote; for
otherwise nothing can be done, nor can the said challenge be brought to a
lawful issue.”
</p>
<p>
“I do so place it,” replied the duenna.
</p>
<p>
“And I too,” added her daughter, all in tears and covered with
shame and confusion.
</p>
<p>
This declaration having been made, and the duke having settled in his own
mind what he would do in the matter, the ladies in black withdrew, and the
duchess gave orders that for the future they were not to be treated as
servants of hers, but as lady adventurers who came to her house to demand
justice; so they gave them a room to themselves and waited on them as they
would on strangers, to the consternation of the other women-servants, who
did not know where the folly and imprudence of Doña Rodriguez and her
unlucky daughter would stop.
</p>
<p>
And now, to complete the enjoyment of the feast and bring the dinner to a
satisfactory end, lo and behold the page who had carried the letters and
presents to Teresa Panza, the wife of the governor Sancho, entered the
hall; and the duke and duchess were very well pleased to see him, being
anxious to know the result of his journey; but when they asked him the
page said in reply that he could not give it before so many people or in a
few words, and begged their excellences to be pleased to let it wait for a
private opportunity, and in the meantime amuse themselves with these
letters; and taking out the letters he placed them in the duchess’s
hand. One bore by way of address, <i>Letter for my lady the Duchess
So-and-so, of I don’t know where; and the other To my husband Sancho
Panza, governor of the island of Barataria, whom God prosper longer than
me</i>. The duchess’s bread would not bake, as the saying is, until she
had read her letter; and having looked over it herself and seen that it
might be read aloud for the duke and all present to hear, she read out as
follows.
</p>
<p class="center">
TERESA PANZA’S LETTER TO THE DUCHESS.
</p>
<p class="letter">
The letter your highness wrote me, my lady, gave me great pleasure, for indeed
I found it very welcome. The string of coral beads is very fine, and my
husband’s hunting suit does not fall short of it. All this village is
very much pleased that your ladyship has made a governor of my good man Sancho;
though nobody will believe it, particularly the curate, and Master Nicholas the
barber, and the bachelor Samson Carrasco; but I don’t care for that, for
so long as it is true, as it is, they may all say what they like; though, to
tell the truth, if the coral beads and the suit had not come I would not have
believed it either; for in this village everybody thinks my husband a numskull,
and except for governing a flock of goats, they cannot fancy what sort of
government he can be fit for. God grant it, and direct him according as he sees
his children stand in need of it. I am resolved with your worship’s
leave, lady of my soul, to make the most of this fair day, and go to Court to
stretch myself at ease in a coach, and make all those I have envying me already
burst their eyes out; so I beg your excellence to order my husband to send me a
small trifle of money, and to let it be something to speak of, because
one’s expenses are heavy at the Court; for a loaf costs a real, and meat
thirty maravedis a pound, which is beyond everything; and if he does not want
me to go let him tell me in time, for my feet are on the fidgets to be off; and
my friends and neighbours tell me that if my daughter and I make a figure and a
brave show at Court, my husband will come to be known far more by me than I by
him, for of course plenty of people will ask, “Who are those ladies in
that coach?” and some servant of mine will answer, “The wife and
daughter of Sancho Panza, governor of the island of Barataria;” and in
this way Sancho will become known, and I’ll be thought well of, and
“to Rome for everything.” I am as vexed as vexed can be that they
have gathered no acorns this year in our village; for all that I send your
highness about half a peck that I went to the wood to gather and pick out one
by one myself, and I could find no bigger ones; I wish they were as big as
ostrich eggs.<br>
    Let not your high mightiness forget to write to me; and I will take care to
answer, and let you know how I am, and whatever news there may be in this
place, where I remain, praying our Lord to have your highness in his keeping
and not to forget me.<br>
    Sancha my daughter, and my son, kiss your worship’s hands.<br>
    She who would rather see your ladyship than write to you,
</p>
<p class="right">
Your servant,<br>
TERESA PANZA.
</p>
<p>
All were greatly amused by Teresa Panza’s letter, but particularly
the duke and duchess; and the duchess asked Don Quixote’s opinion
whether they might open the letter that had come for the governor, which
she suspected must be very good. Don Quixote said that to gratify them he
would open it, and did so, and found that it ran as follows.
</p>
<p class="center">
TERESA PANZA’S LETTER TO HER HUSBAND SANCHO PANZA.
</p>
<p class="letter">
I got thy letter, Sancho of my soul, and I promise thee and swear as a Catholic
Christian that I was within two fingers’ breadth of going mad I was so
happy. I can tell thee, brother, when I came to hear that thou wert a governor
I thought I should have dropped dead with pure joy; and thou knowest they say
sudden joy kills as well as great sorrow; and as for Sanchica thy daughter, she
leaked from sheer happiness. I had before me the suit thou didst send me, and
the coral beads my lady the duchess sent me round my neck, and the letters in
my hands, and there was the bearer of them standing by, and in spite of all
this I verily believed and thought that what I saw and handled was all a dream;
for who could have thought that a goatherd would come to be a governor of
islands? Thou knowest, my friend, what my mother used to say, that one must
live long to see much; I say it because I expect to see more if I live longer;
for I don’t expect to stop until I see thee a farmer of taxes or a
collector of revenue, which are offices where, though the devil carries off
those who make a bad use of them, still they make and handle money. My lady the
duchess will tell thee the desire I have to go to the Court; consider the
matter and let me know thy pleasure; I will try to do honour to thee by going
in a coach.<br>
    Neither the curate, nor the barber, nor the bachelor, nor even the sacristan,
can believe that thou art a governor, and they say the whole thing is a
delusion or an enchantment affair, like everything belonging to thy master Don
Quixote; and Samson says he must go in search of thee and drive the government
out of thy head and the madness out of Don Quixote’s skull; I only laugh,
and look at my string of beads, and plan out the dress I am going to make for
our daughter out of thy suit. I sent some acorns to my lady the duchess; I wish
they had been gold. Send me some strings of pearls if they are in fashion in
that island. Here is the news of the village; La Berrueca has married her
daughter to a good-for-nothing painter, who came here to paint anything that
might turn up. The council gave him an order to paint his Majesty’s arms
over the door of the town-hall; he asked two ducats, which they paid him in
advance; he worked for eight days, and at the end of them had nothing painted,
and then said he had no turn for painting such trifling things; he returned the
money, and for all that has married on the pretence of being a good workman; to
be sure he has now laid aside his paint-brush and taken a spade in hand, and
goes to the field like a gentleman. Pedro Lobo’s son has received the
first orders and tonsure, with the intention of becoming a priest. Minguilla,
Mingo Silvato’s granddaughter, found it out, and has gone to law with him
on the score of having given her promise of marriage. Evil tongues say she is
with child by him, but he denies it stoutly. There are no olives this year, and
there is not a drop of vinegar to be had in the whole village. A company of
soldiers passed through here; when they left they took away with them three of
the girls of the village; I will not tell thee who they are; perhaps they will
come back, and they will be sure to find those who will take them for wives
with all their blemishes, good or bad. Sanchica is making bonelace; she earns
eight maravedis a day clear, which she puts into a moneybox as a help towards
house furnishing; but now that she is a governor’s daughter thou wilt
give her a portion without her working for it. The fountain in the plaza has
run dry. A flash of lightning struck the gibbet, and I wish they all lit there.
I look for an answer to this, and to know thy mind about my going to the Court;
and so, God keep thee longer than me, or as long, for I would not leave thee in
this world without me.
</p>
<p class="right">
Thy wife,<br>
TERESA PANZA.
</p>
<p>
The letters were applauded, laughed over, relished, and admired; and then,
as if to put the seal to the business, the courier arrived, bringing the
one Sancho sent to Don Quixote, and this, too, was read out, and it raised
some doubts as to the governor’s simplicity. The duchess withdrew to
hear from the page about his adventures in Sancho’s village, which
he narrated at full length without leaving a single circumstance
unmentioned. He gave her the acorns, and also a cheese which Teresa had
given him as being particularly good and superior to those of Tronchon.
The duchess received it with greatest delight, in which we will leave her,
to describe the end of the government of the great Sancho Panza, flower
and mirror of all governors of islands.

To fancy that in this life anything belonging to it will remain for ever
in the same state is an idle fancy; on the contrary, in it everything
seems to go in a circle, I mean round and round. The spring succeeds the
summer, the summer the fall, the fall the autumn, the autumn the winter,
and the winter the spring, and so time rolls with never-ceasing wheel. Man’s
life alone, swifter than time, speeds onward to its end without any hope
of renewal, save it be in that other life which is endless and boundless.
Thus saith Cide Hamete the Mahometan philosopher; for there are many that
by the light of nature alone, without the light of faith, have a
comprehension of the fleeting nature and instability of this present life
and the endless duration of that eternal life we hope for; but our author
is here speaking of the rapidity with which Sancho’s government came
to an end, melted away, disappeared, vanished as it were in smoke and
shadow. For as he lay in bed on the night of the seventh day of his
government, sated, not with bread and wine, but with delivering judgments
and giving opinions and making laws and proclamations, just as sleep, in
spite of hunger, was beginning to close his eyelids, he heard such a noise
of bell-ringing and shouting that one would have fancied the whole island
was going to the bottom. He sat up in bed and remained listening intently
to try if he could make out what could be the cause of so great an uproar;
not only, however, was he unable to discover what it was, but as countless
drums and trumpets now helped to swell the din of the bells and shouts, he
was more puzzled than ever, and filled with fear and terror; and getting
up he put on a pair of slippers because of the dampness of the floor, and
without throwing a dressing gown or anything of the kind over him he
rushed out of the door of his room, just in time to see approaching along
a corridor a band of more than twenty persons with lighted torches and
naked swords in their hands, all shouting out, “To arms, to arms,
señor governor, to arms! The enemy is in the island in countless numbers,
and we are lost unless your skill and valour come to our support.”
</p>
<p>
Keeping up this noise, tumult, and uproar, they came to where Sancho stood
dazed and bewildered by what he saw and heard, and as they approached one
of them called out to him, “Arm at once, your lordship, if you would
not have yourself destroyed and the whole island lost.”
</p>
<p>
“What have I to do with arming?” said Sancho. “What do I
know about arms or supports? Better leave all that to my master Don
Quixote, who will settle it and make all safe in a trice; for I, sinner
that I am, God help me, don’t understand these scuffles.”
</p>
<p>
“Ah, señor governor,” said another, “what slackness of
mettle this is! Arm yourself; here are arms for you, offensive and
defensive; come out to the plaza and be our leader and captain; it falls
upon you by right, for you are our governor.”
</p>
<p>
“Arm me then, in God’s name,” said Sancho, and they at
once produced two large shields they had come provided with, and placed
them upon him over his shirt, without letting him put on anything else,
one shield in front and the other behind, and passing his arms through
openings they had made, they bound him tight with ropes, so that there he
was walled and boarded up as straight as a spindle and unable to bend his
knees or stir a single step. In his hand they placed a lance, on which he
leant to keep himself from falling, and as soon as they had him thus fixed
they bade him march forward and lead them on and give them all courage;
for with him for their guide and lamp and morning star, they were sure to
bring their business to a successful issue.

</p>
<p>
“How am I to march, unlucky being that I am?” said Sancho,
“when I can’t stir my knee-caps, for these boards I have bound
so tight to my body won’t let me. What you must do is carry me in
your arms, and lay me across or set me upright in some postern, and I’ll
hold it either with this lance or with my body.”
</p>
<p>
“On, señor governor!” cried another, “it is fear more
than the boards that keeps you from moving; make haste, stir yourself, for
there is no time to lose; the enemy is increasing in numbers, the shouts
grow louder, and the danger is pressing.”
</p>
<p>
Urged by these exhortations and reproaches the poor governor made an
attempt to advance, but fell to the ground with such a crash that he
fancied he had broken himself all to pieces. There he lay like a tortoise
enclosed in its shell, or a side of bacon between two kneading-troughs, or
a boat bottom up on the beach; nor did the gang of jokers feel any
compassion for him when they saw him down; so far from that, extinguishing
their torches they began to shout afresh and to renew the calls to arms
with such energy, trampling on poor Sancho, and slashing at him over the
shield with their swords in such a way that, if he had not gathered
himself together and made himself small and drawn in his head between the
shields, it would have fared badly with the poor governor, as, squeezed
into that narrow compass, he lay, sweating and sweating again, and
commending himself with all his heart to God to deliver him from his
present peril. Some stumbled over him, others fell upon him, and one there
was who took up a position on top of him for some time, and from thence as
if from a watchtower issued orders to the troops, shouting out, “Here,
our side! Here the enemy is thickest! Hold the breach there! Shut that
gate! Barricade those ladders! Here with your stink-pots of pitch and
resin, and kettles of boiling oil! Block the streets with feather beds!”
In short, in his ardour he mentioned every little thing, and every
implement and engine of war by means of which an assault upon a city is
warded off, while the bruised and battered Sancho, who heard and suffered
all, was saying to himself, “O if it would only please the Lord to
let the island be lost at once, and I could see myself either dead or out
of this torture!” Heaven heard his prayer, and when he least
expected it he heard voices exclaiming, “Victory, victory! The enemy
retreats beaten! Come, señor governor, get up, and come and enjoy the
victory, and divide the spoils that have been won from the foe by the
might of that invincible arm.”
</p>
<p>
“Lift me up,” said the wretched Sancho in a woebegone voice.
They helped him to rise, and as soon as he was on his feet said, “The
enemy I have beaten you may nail to my forehead; I don’t want to
divide the spoils of the foe, I only beg and entreat some friend, if I
have one, to give me a sup of wine, for I’m parched with thirst, and
wipe me dry, for I’m turning to water.”
</p>
<p>
They rubbed him down, fetched him wine and unbound the shields, and he
seated himself upon his bed, and with fear, agitation, and fatigue he
fainted away. Those who had been concerned in the joke were now sorry they
had pushed it so far; however, the anxiety his fainting away had caused
them was relieved by his returning to himself. He asked what o’clock
it was; they told him it was just daybreak. He said no more, and in
silence began to dress himself, while all watched him, waiting to see what
the haste with which he was putting on his clothes meant.
</p>

<p>
He got himself dressed at last, and then, slowly, for he was sorely
bruised and could not go fast, he proceeded to the stable, followed by all
who were present, and going up to Dapple embraced him and gave him a
loving kiss on the forehead, and said to him, not without tears in his
eyes, “Come along, comrade and friend and partner of my toils and
sorrows; when I was with you and had no cares to trouble me except mending
your harness and feeding your little carcass, happy were my hours, my
days, and my years; but since I left you, and mounted the towers of
ambition and pride, a thousand miseries, a thousand troubles, and four
thousand anxieties have entered into my soul;” and all the while he
was speaking in this strain he was fixing the pack-saddle on the ass,
without a word from anyone. Then having Dapple saddled, he, with great
pain and difficulty, got up on him, and addressing himself to the
majordomo, the secretary, the head-carver, and Pedro Recio the doctor and
several others who stood by, he said, “Make way, gentlemen, and let
me go back to my old freedom; let me go look for my past life, and raise
myself up from this present death. I was not born to be a governor or
protect islands or cities from the enemies that choose to attack them.
Ploughing and digging, vinedressing and pruning, are more in my way than
defending provinces or kingdoms. Saint Peter is very well at Rome;
I mean each of us is best following the trade he was born to. A
reaping-hook fits my hand better than a governor’s sceptre; I’d
rather have my fill of gazpacho than be subject to the misery of a
meddling doctor who kills me with hunger, and I’d rather lie in
summer under the shade of an oak, and in winter wrap myself in a double
sheepskin jacket in freedom, than go to bed between holland sheets and
dress in sables under the restraint of a government. God be with your
worships, and tell my lord the duke that ‘naked I was born, naked I
find myself, I neither lose nor gain;’ I mean that without a
farthing I came into this government, and without a farthing I go out of
it, very different from the way governors commonly leave other islands.
Stand aside and let me go; I have to plaster myself, for I believe every
one of my ribs is crushed, thanks to the enemies that have been trampling
over me to-night.”
</p>
<p>
“That is unnecessary, señor governor,” said Doctor Recio,
“for I will give your worship a draught against falls and bruises
that will soon make you as sound and strong as ever; and as for your diet
I promise your worship to behave better, and let you eat plentifully of
whatever you like.”
</p>
<p>
“You spoke late,” said Sancho. “I’d as soon turn
Turk as stay any longer. Those jokes won’t pass a second time. By
God I’d as soon remain in this government, or take another, even if
it was offered me between two plates, as fly to heaven without wings. I am
of the breed of the Panzas, and they are every one of them obstinate, and
if they once say ‘odds,’ odds it must be, no matter if it is
evens, in spite of all the world. Here in this stable I leave the ant’s
wings that lifted me up into the air for the swifts and other birds to eat
me, and let’s take to level ground and our feet once more; and if
they’re not shod in pinked shoes of cordovan, they won’t want
for rough sandals of hemp; ‘every ewe to her like,’ ‘and
let no one stretch his leg beyond the length of the sheet;’ and now
let me pass, for it’s growing late with me.”
</p>
<p>
To this the majordomo said, “Señor governor, we would let your
worship go with all our hearts, though it sorely grieves us to lose you,
for your wit and Christian conduct naturally make us regret you; but it is
well known that every governor, before he leaves the place where he has
been governing, is bound first of all to render an account. Let your
worship do so for the ten days you have held the government, and then you
may go and the peace of God go with you.”
</p>
<p>
“No one can demand it of me,” said Sancho, “but he whom
my lord the duke shall appoint; I am going to meet him, and to him I will
render an exact one; besides, when I go forth naked as I do, there is no
other proof needed to show that I have governed like an angel.”
</p>
<p>
“By God the great Sancho is right,” said Doctor Recio, “and
we should let him go, for the duke will be beyond measure glad to see him.”
</p>
<p>
They all agreed to this, and allowed him to go, first offering to bear him
company and furnish him with all he wanted for his own comfort or for the
journey. Sancho said he did not want anything more than a little barley
for Dapple, and half a cheese and half a loaf for himself; for the
distance being so short there was no occasion for any better or bulkier
provant. They all embraced him, and he with tears embraced all of them,
and left them filled with admiration not only at his remarks but at his
firm and sensible resolution.

<p>
The duke and duchess resolved that the challenge Don Quixote had, for the
reason already mentioned, given their vassal, should be proceeded with;
and as the young man was in Flanders, whither he had fled to escape having
Doña Rodriguez for a mother-in-law, they arranged to substitute for him a
Gascon lacquey, named Tosilos, first of all carefully instructing him in
all he had to do. Two days later the duke told Don Quixote that in four
days from that time his opponent would present himself on the field of
battle armed as a knight, and would maintain that the damsel lied by half
a beard, nay a whole beard, if she affirmed that he had given her a
promise of marriage. Don Quixote was greatly pleased at the news, and
promised himself to do wonders in the lists, and reckoned it rare good
fortune that an opportunity should have offered for letting his noble
hosts see what the might of his strong arm was capable of; and so in high
spirits and satisfaction he awaited the expiration of the four days, which
measured by his impatience seemed spinning themselves out into four
hundred ages. Let us leave them to pass as we do other things, and go and
bear Sancho company, as mounted on Dapple, half glad, half sad, he paced
along on his road to join his master, in whose society he was happier than
in being governor of all the islands in the world. Well then, it so
happened that before he had gone a great way from the island of his
government (and whether it was island, city, town, or village that he
governed he never troubled himself to inquire) he saw coming along the
road he was travelling six pilgrims with staves, foreigners of that sort
that beg for alms singing; who as they drew near arranged themselves in a
line and lifting up their voices all together began to sing in their own
language something that Sancho could not understand, with the exception of one word
which sounded plainly “alms,” from which he gathered that it
was alms they asked for in their song; and being, as Cide Hamete says,
remarkably charitable, he took out of his alforjas the half loaf and half
cheese he had been provided with, and gave them to them, explaining to
them by signs that he had nothing else to give them. They received them
very gladly, but exclaimed, “Geld! Geld!”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t understand what you want of me, good people,”
said Sancho.
</p>
<p>
On this one of them took a purse out of his bosom and showed it to Sancho,
by which he comprehended they were asking for money, and putting his thumb
to his throat and spreading his hand upwards he gave them to understand
that he had not the sign of a coin about him, and urging Dapple forward he
broke through them. But as he was passing, one of them who had been
examining him very closely rushed towards him, and flinging his arms round
him exclaimed in a loud voice and good Spanish, “God bless me! What’s
this I see? Is it possible that I hold in my arms my dear friend, my good
neighbour Sancho Panza? But there’s no doubt about it, for I’m
not asleep, nor am I drunk just now.”
</p>
<p>
Sancho was surprised to hear himself called by his name and find himself
embraced by a foreign pilgrim, and after regarding him steadily without
speaking he was still unable to recognise him; but the pilgrim perceiving
his perplexity cried, “What! and is it possible, Sancho Panza, that
thou dost not know thy neighbour Ricote, the Morisco shopkeeper of thy
village?”
</p>
<p>
Sancho upon this looking at him more carefully began to recall his
features, and at last recognised him perfectly, and without getting off
the ass threw his arms round his neck saying, “Who the devil could
have known thee, Ricote, in this mummer’s dress thou art in? Tell
me, who has frenchified thee, and how dost thou dare to return to Spain,
where if they catch thee and recognise thee it will go hard enough with
thee?”
</p>
<p>
“If thou dost not betray me, Sancho,” said the pilgrim,
“I am safe; for in this dress no one will recognise me; but let us
turn aside out of the road into that grove there where my comrades are
going to eat and rest, and thou shalt eat with them there, for they are
very good fellows; I’ll have time enough to tell thee then all that
has happened me since I left our village in obedience to his Majesty’s
edict that threatened such severities against the unfortunate people of my
nation, as thou hast heard.”
</p>
<p>
Sancho complied, and Ricote having spoken to the other pilgrims they
withdrew to the grove they saw, turning a considerable distance out of the
road. They threw down their staves, took off their pilgrim’s cloaks
and remained in their under-clothing; they were all good-looking young
fellows, except Ricote, who was a man somewhat advanced in years. They
carried alforjas all of them, and all apparently well filled, at least
with things provocative of thirst, such as would summon it from two
leagues off. They stretched themselves on the ground, and making a
tablecloth of the grass they spread upon it bread, salt, knives, walnut,
scraps of cheese, and well-picked ham-bones which if they were past
gnawing were not past sucking. They also put down a black dainty called,
they say, caviar, and made of the eggs of fish, a great thirst-wakener.
Nor was there any lack of olives, dry, it is true, and without any
seasoning, but for all that toothsome and pleasant. But what made the best
show in the field of the banquet was half a dozen botas of wine, for each
of them produced his own from his alforjas; even the good Ricote, who from
a Morisco had transformed himself into a German or Dutchman, took out his,
which in size might have vied with the five others. They then began to eat
with very great relish and very leisurely, making the most of each morsel—very
small ones of everything—they took up on the point of the knife; and
then all at the same moment raised their arms and botas aloft, the mouths
placed in their mouths, and all eyes fixed on heaven just as if they were
taking aim at it; and in this attitude they remained ever so long, wagging
their heads from side to side as if in acknowledgment of the pleasure they
were enjoying while they decanted the bowels of the bottles into their own
stomachs.
</p>
<p>
Sancho beheld all, “and nothing gave him pain;” so far from
that, acting on the proverb he knew so well, “when thou art at Rome
do as thou seest,” he asked Ricote for his bota and took aim like
the rest of them, and with not less enjoyment. Four times did the botas
bear being uplifted, but the fifth it was all in vain, for they were drier
and more sapless than a rush by that time, which made the jollity that had
been kept up so far begin to flag.
</p>
<p>
Every now and then someone of them would grasp Sancho’s right hand
in his own saying, “Español y Tudesqui tuto uno: bon compaño;”
and Sancho would answer, “Bon compaño, jur a Di!” and then go
off into a fit of laughter that lasted an hour, without a thought for the
moment of anything that had befallen him in his government; for cares have
very little sway over us while we are eating and drinking. At length, the
wine having come to an end with them, drowsiness began to come over them,
and they dropped asleep on their very table and tablecloth. Ricote and
Sancho alone remained awake, for they had eaten more and drunk less, and
Ricote drawing Sancho aside, they seated themselves at the foot of a
beech, leaving the pilgrims buried in sweet sleep; and without once
falling into his own Morisco tongue Ricote spoke as follows in pure
Castilian:
</p>
<p>
“Thou knowest well, neighbour and friend Sancho Panza, how the
proclamation or edict his Majesty commanded to be issued against those of
my nation filled us all with terror and dismay; me at least it did,
insomuch that I think before the time granted us for quitting Spain was
out, the full force of the penalty had already fallen upon me and upon my
children. I decided, then, and I think wisely (just like one who knows
that at a certain date the house he lives in will be taken from him, and
looks out beforehand for another to change into), I decided, I say, to
leave the town myself, alone and without my family, and go to seek out
some place to remove them to comfortably and not in the hurried way in
which the others took their departure; for I saw very plainly, and so did
all the older men among us, that the proclamations were not mere threats,
as some said, but positive enactments which would be enforced at the
appointed time; and what made me believe this was what I knew of the base
and extravagant designs which our people harboured, designs of such a
nature that I think it was a divine inspiration that moved his Majesty to
carry out a resolution so spirited; not that we were all guilty, for some
there were true and steadfast Christians; but they were so few that they
could make no head against those who were not; and it was not prudent to
cherish a viper in the bosom by having enemies in the house. In short it
was with just cause that we were visited with the penalty of banishment, a
mild and lenient one in the eyes of some, but to us the most terrible that
could be inflicted upon us. Wherever we are we weep for Spain; for after
all we were born there and it is our natural fatherland. Nowhere do we
find the reception our unhappy condition needs; and in Barbary and all the
parts of Africa where we counted upon being received, succoured, and
welcomed, it is there they insult and ill-treat us most. We knew not our
good fortune until we lost it; and such is the longing we almost all of us
have to return to Spain, that most of those who like myself know the
language, and there are many who do, come back to it and leave their wives
and children forsaken yonder, so great is their love for it; and now I
know by experience the meaning of the saying, sweet is the love of one’s
country.
</p>
<p>
“I left our village, as I said, and went to France, but though they
gave us a kind reception there I was anxious to see all I could. I crossed
into Italy, and reached Germany, and there it seemed to me we might live
with more freedom, as the inhabitants do not pay any attention to trifling
points; everyone lives as he likes, for in most parts they enjoy liberty
of conscience. I took a house in a town near Augsburg, and then joined
these pilgrims, who are in the habit of coming to Spain in great numbers
every year to visit the shrines there, which they look upon as their
Indies and a sure and certain source of gain. They travel nearly all over
it, and there is no town out of which they do not go full up of meat and
drink, as the saying is, and with a real, at least, in money, and they
come off at the end of their travels with more than a hundred crowns
saved, which, changed into gold, they smuggle out of the kingdom either in
the hollow of their staves or in the patches of their pilgrim’s
cloaks or by some device of their own, and carry to their own country in
spite of the guards at the posts and passes where they are searched. Now
my purpose is, Sancho, to carry away the treasure that I left buried,
which, as it is outside the town, I shall be able to do without risk, and
to write, or cross over from Valencia, to my daughter and wife, who I know
are at Algiers, and find some means of bringing them to some French port
and thence to Germany, there to await what it may be God’s will to
do with us; for, after all, Sancho, I know well that Ricota my daughter
and Francisca Ricota my wife are Catholic Christians, and though I am not
so much so, still I am more of a Christian than a Moor, and it is always
my prayer to God that he will open the eyes of my understanding and show
me how I am to serve him; but what amazes me and I cannot understand is
why my wife and daughter should have gone to Barbary rather than to
France, where they could live as Christians.”
</p>
<p>
To this Sancho replied, “Remember, Ricote, that may not have been
open to them, for Juan Tiopieyo thy wife’s brother took them, and
being a true Moor he went where he could go most easily; and another thing
I can tell thee, it is my belief thou art going in vain to look for what
thou hast left buried, for we heard they took from thy brother-in-law and
thy wife a great quantity of pearls and money in gold which they brought
to be passed.”
</p>
<p>
“That may be,” said Ricote; “but I know they did not
touch my hoard, for I did not tell them where it was, for fear of
accidents; and so, if thou wilt come with me, Sancho, and help me to take
it away and conceal it, I will give thee two hundred crowns wherewith thou
mayest relieve thy necessities, and, as thou knowest, I know they are
many.”
</p>
<p>
“I would do it,” said Sancho; “but I am not at all
covetous, for I gave up an office this morning in which, if I was, I might
have made the walls of my house of gold and dined off silver plates before
six months were over; and so for this reason, and because I feel I would
be guilty of treason to my king if I helped his enemies, I would not go
with thee if instead of promising me two hundred crowns thou wert to give
me four hundred here in hand.”
</p>
<p>
“And what office is this thou hast given up, Sancho?” asked
Ricote.
</p>
<p>
“I have given up being governor of an island,” said Sancho,
“and such a one, faith, as you won’t find the like of easily.”
</p>
<p>
“And where is this island?” said Ricote.
</p>
<p>
“Where?” said Sancho; “two leagues from here, and it is
called the island of Barataria.”
</p>
<p>
“Nonsense! Sancho,” said Ricote; “islands are away out
in the sea; there are no islands on the mainland.”
</p>
<p>
“What? No islands!” said Sancho; “I tell thee, friend
Ricote, I left it this morning, and yesterday I was governing there as I
pleased like a sagittarius; but for all that I gave it up, for it seemed
to me a dangerous office, a governor’s.”
</p>
<p>
“And what hast thou gained by the government?” asked Ricote.
</p>
<p>
“I have gained,” said Sancho, “the knowledge that I am
no good for governing, unless it is a drove of cattle, and that the riches
that are to be got by these governments are got at the cost of one’s
rest and sleep, ay and even one’s food; for in islands the governors
must eat little, especially if they have doctors to look after their
health.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t understand thee, Sancho,” said Ricote; “but
it seems to me all nonsense thou art talking. Who would give thee islands
to govern? Is there any scarcity in the world of cleverer men than thou
art for governors? Hold thy peace, Sancho, and come back to thy senses,
and consider whether thou wilt come with me as I said to help me to take
away treasure I left buried (for indeed it may be called a treasure, it is
so large), and I will give thee wherewithal to keep thee, as I told thee.”
</p>
<p>
“And I have told thee already, Ricote, that I will not,” said
Sancho; “let it content thee that by me thou shalt not be betrayed,
and go thy way in God’s name and let me go mine; for I know that
well-gotten gain may be lost, but ill-gotten gain is lost, itself and its
owner likewise.”
</p>
<p>
“I will not press thee, Sancho,” said Ricote; “but tell
me, wert thou in our village when my wife and daughter and brother-in-law
left it?”
</p>
<p>
“I was so,” said Sancho; “and I can tell thee thy
daughter left it looking so lovely that all the village turned out to see
her, and everybody said she was the fairest creature in the world. She
wept as she went, and embraced all her friends and acquaintances and those
who came out to see her, and she begged them all to commend her to God and
Our Lady his mother, and this in such a touching way that it made me weep
myself, though I’m not much given to tears commonly; and, faith,
many a one would have liked to hide her, or go out and carry her off on
the road; but the fear of going against the king’s command kept them
back. The one who showed himself most moved was Don Pedro Gregorio, the
rich young heir thou knowest of, and they say he was deep in love with
her; and since she left he has not been seen in our village again, and we
all suspect he has gone after her to steal her away, but so far nothing
has been heard of it.”
</p>
<p>
“I always had a suspicion that gentleman had a passion for my
