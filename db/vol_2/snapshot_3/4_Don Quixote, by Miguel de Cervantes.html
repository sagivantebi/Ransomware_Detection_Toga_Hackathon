<p>
“Not for me either,” said Sancho, “for more than four hundred Moors have
so thrashed me that the drubbing of the stakes was cakes and fancy-bread
to it. But tell me, señor, what do you call this excellent and rare
adventure that has left us as we are left now? Though your worship was not
so badly off, having in your arms that incomparable beauty you spoke of;
but I, what did I have, except the heaviest whacks I think I had in all my
life? Unlucky me and the mother that bore me! for I am not a knight-errant
and never expect to be one, and of all the mishaps, the greater part falls
to my share.”
</p>
<p>
“Then thou hast been thrashed too?” said Don Quixote.
</p>
<p>
“Didn’t I say so? worse luck to my line!” said Sancho.
</p>
<p>
“Be not distressed, friend,” said Don Quixote, “for I will now make the
precious balsam with which we shall cure ourselves in the twinkling of an
eye.”
</p>
<p>
By this time the cuadrillero had succeeded in lighting the lamp, and came
in to see the man that he thought had been killed; and as Sancho caught
sight of him at the door, seeing him coming in his shirt, with a cloth on
his head, and a lamp in his hand, and a very forbidding countenance, he
said to his master, “Señor, can it be that this is the enchanted Moor
coming back to give us more castigation if there be anything still left in
the ink-bottle?”
</p>
<p>
“It cannot be the Moor,” answered Don Quixote, “for those under
enchantment do not let themselves be seen by anyone.”
</p>
<p>
“If they don’t let themselves be seen, they let themselves be felt,” said
Sancho; “if not, let my shoulders speak to the point.”
</p>
<p>
“Mine could speak too,” said Don Quixote, “but that is not a sufficient
reason for believing that what we see is the enchanted Moor.”
</p>
<p>
The officer came up, and finding them engaged in such a peaceful
conversation, stood amazed; though Don Quixote, to be sure, still lay on
his back unable to move from pure pummelling and plasters. The officer
turned to him and said, “Well, how goes it, good man?”
</p>
<p>
“I would speak more politely if I were you,” replied Don Quixote; “is it
the way of this country to address knights-errant in that style, you
booby?”
</p>
<p>
The cuadrillero finding himself so disrespectfully treated by such a
sorry-looking individual, lost his temper, and raising the lamp full of
oil, smote Don Quixote such a blow with it on the head that he gave him a
badly broken pate; then, all being in darkness, he went out, and Sancho
Panza said, “That is certainly the enchanted Moor, Señor, and he keeps the
treasure for others, and for us only the cuffs and lamp-whacks.”
</p>
<p>
“That is the truth,” answered Don Quixote, “and there is no use in
troubling oneself about these matters of enchantment or being angry or
vexed at them, for as they are invisible and visionary we shall find no
one on whom to avenge ourselves, do what we may; rise, Sancho, if thou
canst, and call the alcaide of this fortress, and get him to give me a
little oil, wine, salt, and rosemary to make the salutiferous balsam, for
indeed I believe I have great need of it now, because I am losing much
blood from the wound that phantom gave me.”
</p>
<p>
Sancho got up with pain enough in his bones, and went after the innkeeper
in the dark, and meeting the officer, who was looking to see what had
become of his enemy, he said to him, “Señor, whoever you are, do us the
favour and kindness to give us a little rosemary, oil, salt, and wine, for
it is wanted to cure one of the best knights-errant on earth, who lies on
yonder bed wounded by the hands of the enchanted Moor that is in this
inn.”
</p>
<p>
When the officer heard him talk in this way, he took him for a man out of
his senses, and as day was now beginning to break, he opened the inn gate,
and calling the host, he told him what this good man wanted. The host
furnished him with what he required, and Sancho brought it to Don Quixote,
who, with his hand to his head, was bewailing the pain of the blow of the
lamp, which had done him no more harm than raising a couple of rather
large lumps, and what he fancied blood was only the sweat that flowed from
him in his sufferings during the late storm. To be brief, he took the
materials, of which he made a compound, mixing them all and boiling them a
good while until it seemed to him they had come to perfection. He then
asked for some vial to pour it into, and as there was not one in the inn,
he decided on putting it into a tin oil-bottle or flask of which the host
made him a free gift; and over the flask he repeated more than eighty
paternosters and as many more ave-marias, salves, and credos, accompanying
each word with a cross by way of benediction, at all which there were
present Sancho, the innkeeper, and the cuadrillero; for the carrier was
now peacefully engaged in attending to the comfort of his mules.
</p>
<p>
This being accomplished, he felt anxious to make trial himself, on the
spot, of the virtue of this precious balsam, as he considered it, and so
he drank near a quart of what could not be put into the flask and remained
in the pigskin in which it had been boiled; but scarcely had he done
drinking when he began to vomit in such a way that nothing was left in his
stomach, and with the pangs and spasms of vomiting he broke into a profuse
sweat, on account of which he bade them cover him up and leave him alone.
They did so, and he lay sleeping more than three hours, at the end of
which he awoke and felt very great bodily relief and so much ease from his
bruises that he thought himself quite cured, and verily believed he had
hit upon the balsam of Fierabras; and that with this remedy he might
thenceforward, without any fear, face any kind of destruction, battle, or
combat, however perilous it might be.
</p>
<p>
Sancho Panza, who also regarded the amendment of his master as miraculous,
begged him to give him what was left in the pigskin, which was no small
quantity. Don Quixote consented, and he, taking it with both hands, in
good faith and with a better will, gulped down and drained off very little
less than his master. But the fact is, that the stomach of poor Sancho was
of necessity not so delicate as that of his master, and so, before
vomiting, he was seized with such gripings and retchings, and such sweats
and faintness, that verily and truly he believed his last hour had come,
and finding himself so racked and tormented he cursed the balsam and the
thief that had given it to him.
</p>
<p>
Don Quixote seeing him in this state said, “It is my belief, Sancho, that
this mischief comes of thy not being dubbed a knight, for I am persuaded
this liquor cannot be good for those who are not so.”
</p>
<p>
“If your worship knew that,” returned Sancho—“woe betide me and all
my kindred!—why did you let me taste it?”
</p>
<p>
At this moment the draught took effect, and the poor squire began to
discharge both ways at such a rate that the rush mat on which he had
thrown himself and the canvas blanket he had covering him were fit for
nothing afterwards. He sweated and perspired with such paroxysms and
convulsions that not only he himself but all present thought his end had
come. This tempest and tribulation lasted about two hours, at the end of
which he was left, not like his master, but so weak and exhausted that he
could not stand. Don Quixote, however, who, as has been said, felt himself
relieved and well, was eager to take his departure at once in quest of
adventures, as it seemed to him that all the time he loitered there was a
fraud upon the world and those in it who stood in need of his help and
protection, all the more when he had the security and confidence his
balsam afforded him; and so, urged by this impulse, he saddled Rocinante
himself and put the pack-saddle on his squire’s beast, whom likewise he
helped to dress and mount the ass; after which he mounted his horse and
turning to a corner of the inn he laid hold of a pike that stood there, to
serve him by way of a lance. All that were in the inn, who were more than
twenty persons, stood watching him; the innkeeper’s daughter was likewise
observing him, and he too never took his eyes off her, and from time to
time fetched a sigh that he seemed to pluck up from the depths of his
bowels; but they all thought it must be from the pain he felt in his ribs;
at any rate they who had seen him plastered the night before thought so.
</p>
<p>
As soon as they were both mounted, at the gate of the inn, he called to
the host and said in a very grave and measured voice, “Many and great are
the favours, Señor Alcaide, that I have received in this castle of yours,
and I remain under the deepest obligation to be grateful to you for them
all the days of my life; if I can repay them in avenging you of any
arrogant foe who may have wronged you, know that my calling is no other
than to aid the weak, to avenge those who suffer wrong, and to chastise
perfidy. Search your memory, and if you find anything of this kind you
need only tell me of it, and I promise you by the order of knighthood
which I have received to procure you satisfaction and reparation to the
utmost of your desire.”
</p>
<p>
The innkeeper replied to him with equal calmness, “Sir Knight, I do not
want your worship to avenge me of any wrong, because when any is done me I
can take what vengeance seems good to me; the only thing I want is that
you pay me the score that you have run up in the inn last night, as well
for the straw and barley for your two beasts, as for supper and beds.”

<br><br><br>
</p>
<p>
“Then this is an inn?” said Don Quixote.
</p>
<p>
“And a very respectable one,” said the innkeeper.
</p>
<p>
“I have been under a mistake all this time,” answered Don Quixote, “for in
truth I thought it was a castle, and not a bad one; but since it appears
that it is not a castle but an inn, all that can be done now is that you
should excuse the payment, for I cannot contravene the rule of
knights-errant, of whom I know as a fact (and up to the present I have
read nothing to the contrary) that they never paid for lodging or anything
else in the inn where they might be; for any hospitality that might be
offered them is their due by law and right in return for the insufferable
toil they endure in seeking adventures by night and by day, in summer and
in winter, on foot and on horseback, in hunger and thirst, cold and heat,
exposed to all the inclemencies of heaven and all the hardships of earth.”
</p>
<p>
“I have little to do with that,” replied the innkeeper; “pay me what you
owe me, and let us have no more talk of chivalry, for all I care about is
to get my money.”
</p>
<p>
“You are a stupid, scurvy innkeeper,” said Don Quixote, and putting spurs
to Rocinante and bringing his pike to the slope he rode out of the inn
before anyone could stop him, and pushed on some distance without looking
to see if his squire was following him.
</p>
<p>
The innkeeper when he saw him go without paying him ran to get payment of
Sancho, who said that as his master would not pay neither would he,
because, being as he was squire to a knight-errant, the same rule and
reason held good for him as for his master with regard to not paying
anything in inns and hostelries. At this the innkeeper waxed very wroth,
and threatened if he did not pay to compel him in a way that he would not
like. To which Sancho made answer that by the law of chivalry his master
had received he would not pay a rap, though it cost him his life; for the
excellent and ancient usage of knights-errant was not going to be violated
by him, nor should the squires of such as were yet to come into the world
ever complain of him or reproach him with breaking so just a privilege.
</p>
<p>
The ill-luck of the unfortunate Sancho so ordered it that among the
company in the inn there were four woolcarders from Segovia, three
needle-makers from the Colt of Cordova, and two lodgers from the Fair of
Seville, lively fellows, tender-hearted, fond of a joke, and playful, who,
almost as if instigated and moved by a common impulse, made up to Sancho
and dismounted him from his ass, while one of them went in for the blanket
of the host’s bed; but on flinging him into it they looked up, and seeing
that the ceiling was somewhat lower than what they required for their work,
they decided upon going out into the yard, which was bounded by the sky,
and there, putting Sancho in the middle of the blanket, they began to
raise him high, making sport with him as they would with a dog at
Shrovetide.
</p>
<p>
<br><br><br><br> <a id="c16d"></a>
</p>
<div class="fig" style="width:60%;">

<br><br><br>
</p>
<p>
The cries of the poor blanketed wretch were so loud that they reached the
ears of his master, who, halting to listen attentively, was persuaded that
some new adventure was coming, until he clearly perceived that it was his
squire who uttered them. Wheeling about he came up to the inn with a
laborious gallop, and finding it shut went round it to see if he could
find some way of getting in; but as soon as he came to the wall of the
yard, which was not very high, he discovered the game that was being
played with his squire. He saw him rising and falling in the air with such
grace and nimbleness that, had his rage allowed him, it is my belief he
would have laughed. He tried to climb from his horse on to the top of the
wall, but he was so bruised and battered that he could not even dismount;
and so from the back of his horse he began to utter such maledictions and
objurgations against those who were blanketing Sancho as it would be
impossible to write down accurately: they, however, did not stay their
laughter or their work for this, nor did the flying Sancho cease his
lamentations, mingled now with threats, now with entreaties but all to
little purpose, or none at all, until from pure weariness they left off.
They then brought him his ass, and mounting him on top of it they put his
jacket round him; and the compassionate Maritornes, seeing him so
exhausted, thought fit to refresh him with a jug of water, and that it
might be all the cooler she fetched it from the well. Sancho took it, and
as he was raising it to his mouth he was stopped by the cries of his
master exclaiming, “Sancho, my son, drink not water; drink it not, my son,
for it will kill thee; see, here I have the blessed balsam (and he held up
the flask of liquor), and with drinking two drops of it thou wilt
certainly be restored.”
</p>
<p>
At these words Sancho turned his eyes asquint, and in a still louder voice
said, “Can it be your worship has forgotten that I am not a knight, or do
you want me to end by vomiting up what bowels I have left after last
night? Keep your liquor in the name of all the devils, and leave me to
myself!” and at one and the same instant he left off talking and began
drinking; but as at the first sup he perceived it was water he did not
care to go on with it, and begged Maritornes to fetch him some wine, which
she did with right good will, and paid for it with her own money; for
indeed they say of her that, though she was in that line of life, there
was some faint and distant resemblance to a Christian about her. When
Sancho had done drinking he dug his heels into his ass, and the gate of
the inn being thrown open he passed out very well pleased at having paid
by the ass had come safe out of the fray with the galley slaves, a
nothing and carried his point, though it had been at the expense of his
usual sureties, his shoulders. It is true that the innkeeper detained his
alforjas in payment of what was owing to him, but Sancho took his
departure in such a flurry that he never missed them. The innkeeper, as
soon as he saw him off, wanted to bar the gate close, but the blanketers
would not agree to it, for they were fellows who would not have cared two
farthings for Don Quixote, even had he been really one of the
knights-errant of the Round Table.

<p>
Sancho reached his master so limp and faint that he could not urge on his
beast. When Don Quixote saw the state he was in he said, “I have now come
to the conclusion, good Sancho, that this castle or inn is beyond a doubt
enchanted, because those who have so atrociously diverted themselves with
thee, what can they be but phantoms or beings of another world? and I hold
this confirmed by having noticed that when I was by the wall of the yard
witnessing the acts of thy sad tragedy, it was out of my power to mount
upon it, nor could I even dismount from Rocinante, because they no doubt
had me enchanted; for I swear to thee by the faith of what I am that if I
had been able to climb up or dismount, I would have avenged thee in such a
way that those braggart thieves would have remembered their freak for
ever, even though in so doing I knew that I contravened the laws of
chivalry, which, as I have often told thee, do not permit a knight to lay
hands on him who is not one, save in case of urgent and great necessity in
defence of his own life and person.”
</p>
<p>
“I would have avenged myself too if I could,” said Sancho, “whether I had
been dubbed knight or not, but I could not; though for my part I am
persuaded those who amused themselves with me were not phantoms or
enchanted men, as your worship says, but men of flesh and bone like
ourselves; and they all had their names, for I heard them name them when
they were tossing me, and one was called Pedro Martinez, and another
Tenorio Hernandez, and the innkeeper, I heard, was called Juan Palomeque
the Left-handed; so that, señor, your not being able to leap over the wall
of the yard or dismount from your horse came of something else besides
enchantments; and what I make out clearly from all this is, that these
adventures we go seeking will in the end lead us into such misadventures
that we shall not know which is our right foot; and that the best and
wisest thing, according to my small wits, would be for us to return home,
now that it is harvest-time, and attend to our business, and give over
wandering from Zeca to Mecca and from pail to bucket, as the saying is.”
</p>
<p>
“How little thou knowest about chivalry, Sancho,” replied Don Quixote;
“hold thy peace and have patience; the day will come when thou shalt see
with thine own eyes what an honourable thing it is to wander in the
pursuit of this calling; nay, tell me, what greater pleasure can there be
in the world, or what delight can equal that of winning a battle, and
triumphing over one’s enemy? None, beyond all doubt.”
</p>
<p>
“Very likely,” answered Sancho, “though I do not know it; all I know is
that since we have been knights-errant, or since your worship has been one
(for I have no right to reckon myself one of so honourable a number) we
have never won any battle except the one with the Biscayan, and even out
of that your worship came with half an ear and half a helmet the less; and
from that till now it has been all cudgellings and more cudgellings, cuffs
and more cuffs, I getting the blanketing over and above, and falling in
with enchanted persons on whom I cannot avenge myself so as to know what
the delight, as your worship calls it, of conquering an enemy is like.”
</p>
<p>
“That is what vexes me, and what ought to vex thee, Sancho,” replied Don
Quixote; “but henceforward I will endeavour to have at hand some sword
made by such craft that no kind of enchantments can take effect upon him
who carries it, and it is even possible that fortune may procure for me
that which belonged to Amadis when he was called ‘The Knight of the
Burning Sword,’ which was one of the best swords that ever knight in the
world possessed, for, besides having the said virtue, it cut like a razor,
</p>
and there was no armour, however strong and enchanted it might be, that
could resist it.”
</p>
<p>
“Such is my luck,” said Sancho, “that even if that happened and your
worship found some such sword, it would, like the balsam, turn out
serviceable and good for dubbed knights only, and as for the squires, they
might sup sorrow.”
</p>
<p>
“Fear not that, Sancho,” said Don Quixote: “Heaven will deal better by
thee.”
</p>
<p>
Thus talking, Don Quixote and his squire were going along, when, on the
road they were following, Don Quixote perceived approaching them a large
and thick cloud of dust, on seeing which he turned to Sancho and said:
</p>
<p>
“This is the day, Sancho, on which will be seen the boon my fortune is
reserving for me; this, I say, is the day on which as much as on any other
shall be displayed the might of my arm, and on which I shall do deeds that
shall remain written in the book of fame for all ages to come. Seest thou
that cloud of dust which rises yonder? Well, then, all that is churned up
by a vast army composed of various and countless nations that comes
marching there.”
</p>
<p>
“According to that there must be two,” said Sancho, “for on this opposite
side also there rises just such another cloud of dust.”
</p>
<p>
Don Quixote turned to look and found that it was true, and rejoicing
exceedingly, he concluded that they were two armies about to engage and
encounter in the midst of that broad plain; for at all times and seasons
his fancy was full of the battles, enchantments, adventures, crazy feats,
loves, and defiances that are recorded in the books of chivalry, and
everything he said, thought, or did had reference to such things. Now the
cloud of dust he had seen was raised by two great droves of sheep coming
along the same road in opposite directions, which, because of the dust,
did not become visible until they drew near, but Don Quixote asserted so
positively that they were armies that Sancho was led to believe it and
say, “Well, and what are we to do, señor?”
</p>
<p>

<br><br><br>
</p>
<p>
“What?” said Don Quixote: “give aid and assistance to the weak and those
who need it; and thou must know, Sancho, that this which comes opposite to
us is conducted and led by the mighty emperor Alifanfaron, lord of the
great isle of Trapobana; this other that marches behind me is that of his
enemy the king of the Garamantas, Pentapolin of the Bare Arm, for he
always goes into battle with his right arm bare.”
</p>
<p>
“But why are these two lords such enemies?”
</p>
<p>
“They are at enmity,” replied Don Quixote, “because this Alifanfaron is a
furious pagan and is in love with the daughter of Pentapolin, who is a
very beautiful and moreover gracious lady, and a Christian, and her father
is unwilling to bestow her upon the pagan king unless he first abandons
the religion of his false prophet Mahomet, and adopts his own.”
</p>
<p>
“By my beard,” said Sancho, “but Pentapolin does quite right, and I will
help him as much as I can.”
</p>
<p>
“In that thou wilt do what is thy duty, Sancho,” said Don Quixote; “for to
engage in battles of this sort it is not requisite to be a dubbed knight.”
</p>
<p>
“That I can well understand,” answered Sancho; “but where shall we put
this ass where we may be sure to find him after the fray is over? for I
believe it has not been the custom so far to go into battle on a beast of
this kind.”
</p>
<p>
“That is true,” said Don Quixote, “and what you had best do with him is to
leave him to take his chance whether he be lost or not, for the horses we
shall have when we come out victors will be so many that even Rocinante
will run a risk of being changed for another. But attend to me and
observe, for I wish to give thee some account of the chief knights who
accompany these two armies; and that thou mayest the better see and mark,
let us withdraw to that hillock which rises yonder, whence both armies may
be seen.”
</p>
<p>
They did so, and placed themselves on a rising ground from which the two
droves that Don Quixote made armies of might have been plainly seen if the
clouds of dust they raised had not obscured them and blinded the sight;
nevertheless, seeing in his imagination what he did not see and what did
not exist, he began thus in a loud voice:
than ever?”
</p>
<p>
“That knight whom thou seest yonder in yellow armour, who bears upon his
shield a lion crowned crouching at the feet of a damsel, is the valiant
Laurcalco, lord of the Silver Bridge; that one in armour with flowers of gold,
who bears on his shield three crowns argent on an azure field, is the dreaded
Micocolembo, grand duke of Quirocia; that other of gigantic frame, on his right
hand, is the ever dauntless Brandabarbaran de Boliche, lord of the three
Arabias, who for armour wears that serpent skin, and has for shield a gate
which, according to tradition, is one of those of the temple that Samson
brought to the ground when by his death he revenged himself upon his enemies.
But turn thine eyes to the other side, and thou shalt see in front and in the
van of this other army the ever victorious and never vanquished Timonel of
Carcajona, prince of New Biscay, who comes in armour with arms quartered azure,
vert, white, and yellow, and bears on his shield a cat or on a field tawny with
a motto which says <i>Miau</i>, which is the beginning of the name of his lady,
who according to report is the peerless Miaulina, daughter of the duke
Alfeniquen of the Algarve; the other, who burdens and presses the loins of that
powerful charger and bears arms white as snow and a shield blank and without
any device, is a novice knight, a Frenchman by birth, Pierres Papin by name,
lord of the baronies of Utrique; that other, who with iron-shod heels strikes
the flanks of that nimble parti-coloured zebra, and for arms bears azure vair,
is the mighty duke of Nerbia, Espartafilardo del Bosque, who bears for device
on his shield an asparagus plant with a motto in Castilian that says,
<i>‘Rastrea mi suerte’</i>.” And so he went on naming a
number of knights of one squadron or the other out of his imagination, and to
all he assigned off-hand their arms, colours, devices, and mottoes, carried
away by the illusions of his unheard-of craze; and without a pause, he
continued, “People of divers nations compose this squadron in front; here
are those that drink of the sweet waters of the famous Xanthus, those that
scour the woody Massilian plains, those that sift the pure fine gold of Arabia
Felix, those that enjoy the famed cool banks of the crystal Thermodon, those
that in many and various ways divert the streams of the golden Pactolus, the
Numidians, faithless in their promises, the Persians renowned in archery, the
Parthians and the Medes that fight as they fly, the Arabs that ever shift their
dwellings, the Scythians as cruel as they are fair, the Ethiopians with pierced
lips, and an infinity of other nations whose features I recognise and descry,
though I cannot recall their names. In this other squadron there come those
that drink of the crystal streams of the olive-bearing Betis, those that make
smooth their countenances with the water of the ever rich and golden Tagus,
those that rejoice in the fertilising flow of the divine Genil, those that roam
the Tartesian plains abounding in pasture, those that take their pleasure in
the Elysian meadows of Jerez, the rich Manchegans crowned with ruddy ears of
corn, the wearers of iron, old relics of the Gothic race, those that bathe in
the Pisuerga renowned for its gentle current, those that feed their herds along
the spreading pastures of the winding Guadiana famed for its hidden course,
those that tremble with the cold of the pineclad Pyrenees or the dazzling snows
of the lofty Apennine; in a word, as many as all Europe includes and
contains.”
</p>
<p>
Good God! what a number of countries and nations he named! giving to each
its proper attributes with marvellous readiness; brimful and saturated
with what he had read in his lying books! Sancho Panza hung upon his words
without speaking, and from time to time turned to try if he could see the
knights and giants his master was describing, and as he could not make out
one of them he said to him:
</p>
<p>
“Señor, devil take it if there’s a sign of any man you talk of, knight or
giant, in the whole thing; maybe it’s all enchantment, like the phantoms
last night.”
</p>
<p>
“How canst thou say that!” answered Don Quixote; “dost thou not hear the
neighing of the steeds, the braying of the trumpets, the roll of the
drums?”
</p>
<p>
“I hear nothing but a great bleating of ewes and sheep,” said Sancho;
which was true, for by this time the two flocks had come close.
</p>
<p>
“The fear thou art in, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “prevents thee from
seeing or hearing correctly, for one of the effects of fear is to derange
the senses and make things appear different from what they are; if thou
art in such fear, withdraw to one side and leave me to myself, for alone I
suffice to bring victory to that side to which I shall give my aid;” and
so saying he gave Rocinante the spur, and putting the lance in rest, shot
down the slope like a thunderbolt. Sancho shouted after him, crying, “Come
back, Señor Don Quixote; I vow to God they are sheep and ewes you are
charging! Come back! Unlucky the father that begot me! what madness is
this! Look, there is no giant, nor knight, nor cats, nor arms, nor shields
quartered or whole, nor vair azure or bedevilled. What are you about?
Sinner that I am before God!” But not for all these entreaties did Don
Quixote turn back; on the contrary he went on shouting out, “Ho, knights,
ye who follow and fight under the banners of the valiant emperor
Pentapolin of the Bare Arm, follow me all; ye shall see how easily I shall
give him his revenge over his enemy Alifanfaron of the Trapobana.”
</p>
<p>
So saying, he dashed into the midst of the squadron of ewes, and began
spearing them with as much spirit and intrepidity as if he were
transfixing mortal enemies in earnest. The shepherds and drovers
accompanying the flock shouted to him to desist; seeing it was no use,
they ungirt their slings and began to salute his ears with stones as big
as one’s fist. Don Quixote gave no heed to the stones, but, letting drive
right and left kept saying:
</p>
<p>
“Where art thou, proud Alifanfaron? Come before me; I am a single knight
who would fain prove thy prowess hand to hand, and make thee yield thy
life a penalty for the wrong thou dost to the valiant Pentapolin
Garamanta.” Here came a sugar-plum from the brook that struck him on the
side and buried a couple of ribs in his body. Feeling himself so smitten,
he imagined himself slain or badly wounded for certain, and recollecting
his liquor he drew out his flask, and putting it to his mouth began to
pour the contents into his stomach; but ere he had succeeded in swallowing
what seemed to him enough, there came another almond which struck him on
the hand and on the flask so fairly that it smashed it to pieces, knocking
three or four teeth and grinders out of his mouth in its course, and
sorely crushing two fingers of his hand. Such was the force of the first
blow and of the second, that the poor knight in spite of himself came down
backwards off his horse. The shepherds came up, and felt sure they had
killed him; so in all haste they collected their flock together, took up
the dead beasts, of which there were more than seven, and made off without
waiting to ascertain anything further.
</p>
<p>
All this time Sancho stood on the hill watching the crazy feats his master
was performing, and tearing his beard and cursing the hour and the
occasion when fortune had made him acquainted with him. Seeing him, then,
brought to the ground, and that the shepherds had taken themselves off, he
ran to him and found him in very bad case, though not unconscious; and
said he:
</p>
<p>
“Did I not tell you to come back, Señor Don Quixote; and that what you
were going to attack were not armies but droves of sheep?”
</p>
<p>
“That’s how that thief of a sage, my enemy, can alter and falsify things,”
answered Don Quixote; “thou must know, Sancho, that it is a very easy
matter for those of his sort to make us believe what they choose; and this
malignant being who persecutes me, envious of the glory he knew I was to
win in this battle, has turned the squadrons of the enemy into droves of
sheep. At any rate, do this much, I beg of thee, Sancho, to undeceive
thyself, and see that what I say is true; mount thy ass and follow them
quietly, and thou shalt see that when they have gone some little distance
from this they will return to their original shape and, ceasing to be
sheep, become men in all respects as I described them to thee at first.
But go not just yet, for I want thy help and assistance; come hither, and
see how many of my teeth and grinders are missing, for I feel as if there
was not one left in my mouth.”
</p>
<p>
Sancho came so close that he almost put his eyes into his mouth; now just
at that moment the balsam had acted on the stomach of Don Quixote, so, at
the very instant when Sancho came to examine his mouth, he discharged all
its contents with more force than a musket, and full into the beard of the
compassionate squire.
</p>
<p>
“Holy Mary!” cried Sancho, “what is this that has happened me? Clearly
this sinner is mortally wounded, as he vomits blood from the mouth;” but
considering the matter a little more closely he perceived by the colour,
taste, and smell, that it was not blood but the balsam from the flask
which he had seen him drink; and he was taken with such a loathing that
his stomach turned, and he vomited up his inside over his very master, and
both were left in a precious state. Sancho ran to his ass to get something
wherewith to clean himself, and relieve his master, out of his alforjas;
but not finding them, he well-nigh took leave of his senses, and cursed
himself anew, and in his heart resolved to quit his master and return
home, even though he forfeited the wages of his service and all hopes of
the promised island.
</p>
<p>
Don Quixote now rose, and putting his left hand to his mouth to keep his
teeth from falling out altogether, with the other he laid hold of the
bridle of Rocinante, who had never stirred from his master’s side—so
loyal and well-behaved was he—and betook himself to where the squire
stood leaning over his ass with his hand to his cheek, like one in deep
dejection. Seeing him in this mood, looking so sad, Don Quixote said to
him:
</p>
<p>
“Bear in mind, Sancho, that one man is no more than another, unless he
does more than another; all these tempests that fall upon us are signs
that fair weather is coming shortly, and that things will go well with us,
for it is impossible for good or evil to last for ever; and hence it
follows that the evil having lasted long, the good must be now nigh at
hand; so thou must not distress thyself at the misfortunes which happen to
me, since thou hast no share in them.”
</p>
<p>
“How have I not?” replied Sancho; “was he whom they blanketed yesterday
perchance any other than my father’s son? and the alforjas that are
missing to-day with all my treasures, did they belong to any other but
myself?”
</p>
<p>
“What! are the alforjas missing, Sancho?” said Don Quixote.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, they are missing,” answered Sancho.
</p>
<p>
“In that case we have nothing to eat to-day,” replied Don Quixote.
</p>
<p>
“It would be so,” answered Sancho, “if there were none of the herbs your
worship says you know in these meadows, those with which knights-errant as
unlucky as your worship are wont to supply such-like shortcomings.”
</p>
<p>
“For all that,” answered Don Quixote, “I would rather have just now a
quarter of bread, or a loaf and a couple of pilchards’ heads, than all the
herbs described by Dioscorides, even with Doctor Laguna’s notes.
Nevertheless, Sancho the Good, mount thy beast and come along with me, for
God, who provides for all things, will not fail us (more especially when
we are so active in his service as we are), since he fails not the midges
of the air, nor the grubs of the earth, nor the tadpoles of the water, and
is so merciful that he maketh his sun to rise on the good and on the evil,
and sendeth rain on the unjust and on the just.”
</p>
<p>
“Your worship would make a better preacher than knight-errant,” said
Sancho.
</p>
<p>
“Knights-errant knew and ought to know everything, Sancho,” said Don
Quixote; “for there were knights-errant in former times as well qualified
to deliver a sermon or discourse in the middle of an encampment, as if
they had graduated in the University of Paris; whereby we may see that the
lance has never blunted the pen, nor the pen the lance.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, be it as your worship says,” replied Sancho; “let us be off now and
find some place of shelter for the night, and God grant it may be
somewhere where there are no blankets, nor blanketeers, nor phantoms, nor
enchanted Moors; for if there are, may the devil take the whole concern.”
</p>
<p>
“Ask that of God, my son,” said Don Quixote; and do thou lead on where
thou wilt, for this time I leave our lodging to thy choice; but reach me
here thy hand, and feel with thy finger, and find out how many of my teeth
and grinders are missing from this right side of the upper jaw, for it is
there I feel the pain.”
</p>
<p>
Sancho put in his fingers, and feeling about asked him, “How many grinders
used your worship have on this side?”
<p>
</p>
<p>
“Four,” replied Don Quixote, “besides the back-tooth, all whole and quite
sound.”
</p>
<p>
“Mind what you are saying, señor.”
</p>
<p>
“I say four, if not five,” answered Don Quixote, “for never in my life
have I had tooth or grinder drawn, nor has any fallen out or been
destroyed by any decay or rheum.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, then,” said Sancho, “in this lower side your worship has no more
than two grinders and a half, and in the upper neither a half nor any at
all, for it is all as smooth as the palm of my hand.”
</p>
<p>
“Luckless that I am!” said Don Quixote, hearing the sad news his squire
gave him; “I had rather they despoiled me of an arm, so it were not the
sword-arm; for I tell thee, Sancho, a mouth without teeth is like a mill
without a millstone, and a tooth is much more to be prized than a diamond;
but we who profess the austere order of chivalry are liable to all this.
Mount, friend, and lead the way, and I will follow thee at whatever pace
thou wilt.”
</p>
<p>
Sancho did as he bade him, and proceeded in the direction in which he
thought he might find refuge without quitting the high road, which was
there very much frequented. As they went along, then, at a slow pace—for
the pain in Don Quixote’s jaws kept him uneasy and ill-disposed for speed—Sancho
thought it well to amuse and divert him by talk of some kind, and among
the things he said to him was that which will be told in the following
chapter.

<h3>
<a id="ch19"></a>CHAPTER XIX.<br>
OF THE SHREWD DISCOURSE WHICH SANCHO HELD WITH HIS MASTER, AND OF THE
ADVENTURE THAT BEFELL HIM WITH A DEAD BODY, TOGETHER WITH OTHER NOTABLE
OCCURRENCES
</h3>
<p>
“It seems to me, señor, that all these mishaps that have befallen us of
late have been without any doubt a punishment for the offence committed by
your worship against the order of chivalry in not keeping the oath you
made not to eat bread off a tablecloth or embrace the queen, and all the
rest of it that your worship swore to observe until you had taken that
helmet of Malandrino’s, or whatever the Moor is called, for I do not very
our village, whom your worship knows well, preach that he who seeks danger
well remember.”
</p>
<p>
“Thou art very right, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “but to tell the truth,
it had escaped my memory; and likewise thou mayest rely upon it that the
affair of the blanket happened to thee because of thy fault in not
reminding me of it in time; but I will make amends, for there are ways of
compounding for everything in the order of chivalry.”
</p>
<p>
“Why! have I taken an oath of some sort, then?” said Sancho.
</p>
<p>
“It makes no matter that thou hast not taken an oath,” said Don Quixote;
“suffice it that I see thou art not quite clear of complicity; and whether
or no, it will not be ill done to provide ourselves with a remedy.”
</p>
<p>
“In that case,” said Sancho, “mind that your worship does not forget this
as you did the oath; perhaps the phantoms may take it into their heads to
amuse themselves once more with me; or even with your worship if they see
you so obstinate.”
</p>
<p>
While engaged in this and other talk, night overtook them on the road
before they had reached or discovered any place of shelter; and what made
it still worse was that they were dying of hunger, for with the loss of
the alforjas they had lost their entire larder and commissariat; and to
complete the misfortune they met with an adventure which without any
invention had really the appearance of one. It so happened that the night
closed in somewhat darkly, but for all that they pushed on, Sancho feeling
sure that as the road was the king’s highway they might reasonably expect
to find some inn within a league or two. Going along, then, in this way,
the night dark, the squire hungry, the master sharp-set, they saw coming
towards them on the road they were travelling a great number of lights
which looked exactly like stars in motion. Sancho was taken aback at the
sight of them, nor did Don Quixote altogether relish them: the one pulled
up his ass by the halter, the other his hack by the bridle, and they stood
still, watching anxiously to see what all this would turn out to be, and
found that the lights were approaching them, and the nearer they came the
greater they seemed, at which spectacle Sancho began to shake like a man
dosed with mercury, and Don Quixote’s hair stood on end; he, however,
plucking up spirit a little, said:
</p>
<p>
“This, no doubt, Sancho, will be a most mighty and perilous adventure, in
which it will be needful for me to put forth all my valour and
resolution.”
</p>
<p>
“Unlucky me!” answered Sancho; “if this adventure happens to be one of
phantoms, as I am beginning to think it is, where shall I find the ribs to
bear it?”
</p>
<p>
“Be they phantoms ever so much,” said Don Quixote, “I will not permit them
to touch a thread of thy garments; for if they played tricks with thee the
time before, it was because I was unable to leap the walls of the yard;
but now we are on a wide plain, where I shall be able to wield my sword as
I please.”
</p>
<p>
“And if they enchant and cripple you as they did the last time,” said
Sancho, “what difference will it make being on the open plain or not?”
</p>
<p>
“For all that,” replied Don Quixote, “I entreat thee, Sancho, to keep a
good heart, for experience will tell thee what mine is.”
</p>
<p>
“I will, please God,” answered Sancho, and the two retiring to one side of
the road set themselves to observe closely what all these moving lights
might be; and very soon afterwards they made out some twenty encamisados,
all on horseback, with lighted torches in their hands, the awe-inspiring
aspect of whom completely extinguished the courage of Sancho, who began to
chatter with his teeth like one in the cold fit of an ague; and his heart
sank and his teeth chattered still more when they perceived distinctly
that behind them there came a litter covered over with black and followed
by six more mounted figures in mourning down to the very feet of their
mules—for they could perceive plainly they were not horses by the
easy pace at which they went. And as the encamisados came along they
muttered to themselves in a low plaintive tone. This strange spectacle at
such an hour and in such a solitary place was quite enough to strike
terror into Sancho’s heart, and even into his master’s; and (save in Don
Quixote’s case) did so, for all Sancho’s resolution had now broken down.
It was just the opposite with his master, whose imagination immediately
conjured up all this to him vividly as one of the adventures of his books.
</p>
<p>
He took it into his head that the litter was a bier on which was borne
some sorely wounded or slain knight, to avenge whom was a task reserved
for him alone; and without any further reasoning he laid his lance in
rest, fixed himself firmly in his saddle, and with gallant spirit and
bearing took up his position in the middle of the road where the
encamisados must of necessity pass; and as soon as he saw them near at
hand he raised his voice and said:
</p>
<p>
“Halt, knights, or whosoever ye may be, and render me account of who ye
are, whence ye come, where ye go, what it is ye carry upon that bier, for,
to judge by appearances, either ye have done some wrong or some wrong has
been done to you, and it is fitting and necessary that I should know,
either that I may chastise you for the evil ye have done, or else that I
may avenge you for the injury that has been inflicted upon you.”
</p>
<p>
“We are in haste,” answered one of the encamisados, “and the inn is far
off, and we cannot stop to render you such an account as you demand;” and
spurring his mule he moved on.
</p>
<p>
Don Quixote was mightily provoked by this answer, and seizing the mule by
the bridle he said, “Halt, and be more mannerly, and render an account of
what I have asked of you; else, take my defiance to combat, all of you.”
</p>
<p>
The mule was shy, and was so frightened at her bridle being seized that
rearing up she flung her rider to the ground over her haunches. An
attendant who was on foot, seeing the encamisado fall, began to abuse Don
Quixote, who now moved to anger, without any more ado, laying his lance in
rest charged one of the men in mourning and brought him badly wounded to
the ground, and as he wheeled round upon the others the agility with which
he attacked and routed them was a sight to see, for it seemed just as if
wings had that instant grown upon Rocinante, so lightly and proudly did he
bear himself. The encamisados were all timid folk and unarmed, so they
speedily made their escape from the fray and set off at a run across the
plain with their lighted torches, looking exactly like maskers running on
some gala or festival night. The mourners, too, enveloped and swathed in
their skirts and gowns, were unable to bestir themselves, and so with
entire safety to himself Don Quixote belaboured them all and drove them
off against their will, for they all thought it was no man but a devil
from hell come to carry away the dead body they had in the litter.
</p>
<p>
Sancho beheld all this in astonishment at the intrepidity of his lord, and
said to himself, “Clearly this master of mine is as bold and valiant as he
says he is.”
</p>
<p>
A burning torch lay on the ground near the first man whom the mule had
thrown, by the light of which Don Quixote perceived him, and coming up to
him he presented the point of the lance to his face, calling on him to
yield himself prisoner, or else he would kill him; to which the prostrate
man replied, “I am prisoner enough as it is; I cannot stir, for one of my
legs is broken: I entreat you, if you be a Christian gentleman, not to
kill me, which will be committing grave sacrilege, for I am a licentiate
and I hold first orders.”
</p>
gentleman, bound to know and distinguish sounds and tell whether they come
<p>
“Then what the devil brought you here, being a churchman?” said Don
Quixote.
</p>
<p>
“What, señor?” said the other. “My bad luck.”
</p>
<p>
“Then still worse awaits you,” said Don Quixote, “if you do not satisfy me
as to all I asked you at first.”
</p>
<p>
“You shall be soon satisfied,” said the licentiate; “you must know, then,
that though just now I said I was a licentiate, I am only a bachelor, and
my name is Alonzo Lopez; I am a native of Alcobendas, I come from the city
of Baeza with eleven others, priests, the same who fled with the torches,
and we are going to the city of Segovia accompanying a dead body which is
in that litter, and is that of a gentleman who died in Baeza, where he was
interred; and now, as I said, we are taking his bones to their
burial-place, which is in Segovia, where he was born.”
</p>
<p>
“And who killed him?” asked Don Quixote.
</p>
<p>
“God, by means of a malignant fever that took him,” answered the bachelor.
</p>
<p>
<p>
“In that case,” said Don Quixote, “the Lord has relieved me of the task of
avenging his death had any other slain him; but, he who slew him having
slain him, there is nothing for it but to be silent, and shrug one’s
shoulders; I should do the same were he to slay myself; and I would have
your reverence know that I am a knight of La Mancha, Don Quixote by name,
and it is my business and calling to roam the world righting wrongs and
redressing injuries.”
</p>
<p>
“I do not know how that about righting wrongs can be,” said the bachelor,
“for from straight you have made me crooked, leaving me with a broken leg
that will never see itself straight again all the days of its life; and
the injury you have redressed in my case has been to leave me injured in
such a way that I shall remain injured for ever; and the height of
misadventure it was to fall in with you who go in search of adventures.”
</p>
<p>
“Things do not all happen in the same way,” answered Don Quixote; “it all
came, Sir Bachelor Alonzo Lopez, of your going, as you did, by night,
dressed in those surplices, with lighted torches, praying, covered with
mourning, so that naturally you looked like something evil and of the
other world; and so I could not avoid doing my duty in attacking you, and
I should have attacked you even had I known positively that you were the
very devils of hell, for such I certainly believed and took you to be.”
</p>
<p>
“As my fate has so willed it,” said the bachelor, “I entreat you, sir
knight-errant, whose errand has been such an evil one for me, to help me
to get from under this mule that holds one of my legs caught between the
stirrup and the saddle.”
</p>
<p>
“I would have talked on till to-morrow,” said Don Quixote; “how long were
you going to wait before telling me of your distress?”
</p>
<p>
He at once called to Sancho, who, however, had no mind to come, as he was
just then engaged in unloading a sumpter mule, well laden with provender,
which these worthy gentlemen had brought with them. Sancho made a bag of
his coat, and, getting together as much as he could, and as the bag would
hold, he loaded his beast, and then hastened to obey his master’s call,
and helped him to remove the bachelor from under the mule; then putting
him on her back he gave him the torch, and Don Quixote bade him follow the
track of his companions, and beg pardon of them on his part for the wrong
which he could not help doing them.
</p>
<p>
And said Sancho, “If by chance these gentlemen should want to know who was
the hero that served them so, your worship may tell them that he is the
famous Don Quixote of La Mancha, otherwise called the Knight of the Rueful
Countenance.”
</p>
<p>
The bachelor then took his departure.
</p>
<p>
I forgot to mention that before he did so he said to Don Quixote,
“Remember that you stand excommunicated for having laid violent hands on a
holy thing, <i>juxta illud, si quis, suadente diabolo</i>.”
</p>
<p>
“I do not understand that Latin,” answered Don Quixote, “but I know well I
did not lay hands, only this pike; besides, I did not think I was
committing an assault upon priests or things of the Church, which, like a
Catholic and faithful Christian as I am, I respect and revere, but upon
phantoms and spectres of the other world; but even so, I remember how it
fared with Cid Ruy Diaz when he broke the chair of the ambassador of that
king before his Holiness the Pope, who excommunicated him for the same;
and yet the good Roderick of Vivar bore himself that day like a very noble
and valiant knight.”
</p>
<p>
On hearing this the bachelor took his departure, as has been said, without
making any reply; and Don Quixote asked Sancho what had induced him to
call him the “Knight of the Rueful Countenance” more then than at any
other time.
</p>
<p>
“I will tell you,” answered Sancho; “it was because I have been looking at
you for some time by the light of the torch held by that unfortunate, and
verily your worship has got of late the most ill-favoured countenance I
ever saw: it must be either owing to the fatigue of this combat, or else
to the want of teeth and grinders.”
</p>
<p>
“It is not that,” replied Don Quixote, “but because the sage whose duty it
will be to write the history of my achievements must have thought it
proper that I should take some distinctive name as all knights of yore
did; one being ‘He of the Burning Sword,’ another ‘He of the Unicorn,’
this one ‘He of the Damsels,’ that ‘He of the Phœnix,’ another ‘The
Knight of the Griffin,’ and another ‘He of the Death,’ and by these names
and designations they were known all the world round; and so I say that
the sage aforesaid must have put it into your mouth and mind just now to
call me ‘The Knight of the Rueful Countenance,’ as I intend to call myself
from this day forward; and that the said name may fit me better, I mean,
when the opportunity offers, to have a very rueful countenance painted on
my shield.”
</p>
<p>
“There is no occasion, señor, for wasting time or money on making that
countenance,” said Sancho; “for all that need be done is for your worship
to show your own, face to face, to those who look at you, and without
anything more, either image or shield, they will call you ‘Him of the
Rueful Countenance’ and believe me I am telling you the truth, for I
assure you, señor (and in good part be it said), hunger and the loss of
your grinders have given you such an ill-favoured face that, as I say, the
rueful picture may be very well spared.”
</p>
<p>
Don Quixote laughed at Sancho’s pleasantry; nevertheless he resolved to
call himself by that name, and have his shield or buckler painted as he
had devised.
</p>
<p>
Don Quixote would have looked to see whether the body in the litter were
bones or not, but Sancho would not have it, saying:
</p>
<p>
“Señor, you have ended this perilous adventure more safely for yourself
than any of those I have seen: perhaps these people, though beaten and
routed, may bethink themselves that it is a single man that has beaten
them, and feeling sore and ashamed of it may take heart and come in search
of us and give us trouble enough. The ass is in proper trim, the mountains
are near at hand, hunger presses, we have nothing more to do but make good
our retreat, and, as the saying is, the dead to the grave and the living
to the loaf.”
</p>
<p>
And driving his ass before him he begged his master to follow, who,
feeling that Sancho was right, did so without replying; and after
proceeding some little distance between two hills they found themselves in
a wide and retired valley, where they alighted, and Sancho unloaded his
beast, and stretched upon the green grass, with hunger for sauce, they
breakfasted, dined, lunched, and supped all at once, satisfying their
appetites with more than one store of cold meat which the dead man’s
clerical gentlemen (who seldom put themselves on short allowance) had
brought with them on their sumpter mule. But another piece of ill-luck
befell them, which Sancho held the worst of all, and that was that they
had no wine to drink, nor even water to moisten their lips; and as thirst
tormented them, Sancho, observing that the meadow where they were was full
of green and tender grass, said what will be told in the following
chapter.

“It cannot be, señor, but that this grass is a proof that there must be
hard by some spring or brook to give it moisture, so it would be well to
move a little farther on, that we may find some place where we may quench
this terrible thirst that plagues us, which beyond a doubt is more
distressing than hunger.”
</p>
<p>
The advice seemed good to Don Quixote, and, he leading Rocinante by the
bridle and Sancho the ass by the halter, after he had packed away upon him
the remains of the supper, they advanced the meadow feeling their way, for
the darkness of the night made it impossible to see anything; but they had
not gone two hundred paces when a loud noise of water, as if falling from
great rocks, struck their ears. The sound cheered them greatly; but
halting to make out by listening from what quarter it came they heard
unseasonably another noise which spoiled the satisfaction the sound of the
water gave them, especially for Sancho, who was by nature timid and
faint-hearted. They heard, I say, strokes falling with a measured beat,
and a certain rattling of iron and chains that, together with the furious
din of the water, would have struck terror into any heart but Don
Quixote’s. The night was, as has been said, dark, and they had happened to
reach a spot in among some tall trees, whose leaves stirred by a gentle
breeze made a low ominous sound; so that, what with the solitude, the
place, the darkness, the noise of the water, and the rustling of the
leaves, everything inspired awe and dread; more especially as they
perceived that the strokes did not cease, nor the wind lull, nor morning
approach; to all which might be added their ignorance as to where they
were.

But Don Quixote, supported by his intrepid heart, leaped on Rocinante, and
bracing his buckler on his arm, brought his pike to the slope, and said,
“Friend Sancho, know that I by Heaven’s will have been born in this our
iron age to revive in it the age of gold, or the golden as it is
called; I am he for whom perils, mighty achievements, and valiant deeds
are reserved; I am, I say again, he who is to revive the Knights of the
Round Table, the Twelve of France and the Nine Worthies; and he who is to
consign to oblivion the Platirs, the Tablantes, the Olivantes and
Tirantes, the Phœbuses and Belianises, with the whole herd of famous
knights-errant of days gone by, performing in these in which I live such
exploits, marvels, and feats of arms as shall obscure their brightest
deeds. Thou dost mark well, faithful and trusty squire, the gloom of this
night, its strange silence, the dull confused murmur of those trees, the
awful sound of that water in quest of which we came, that seems as though
it were precipitating and dashing itself down from the lofty mountains of
the Moon, and that incessant hammering that wounds and pains our ears;
which things all together and each of itself are enough to instil fear,
dread, and dismay into the breast of Mars himself, much more into one not
used to hazards and adventures of the kind. Well, then, all this that I
put before thee is but an incentive and stimulant to my spirit, making my
heart burst in my bosom through eagerness to engage in this adventure,
arduous as it promises to be; therefore tighten Rocinante’s girths a
little, and God be with thee; wait for me here three days and no more, and
if in that time I come not back, thou canst return to our village, and
thence, to do me a favour and a service, thou wilt go to El Toboso, where
thou shalt say to my incomparable lady Dulcinea that her captive knight
hath died in attempting things that might make him worthy of being called
hers.”
</p>
<p>
When Sancho heard his master’s words he began to weep in the most pathetic
way, saying:
</p>
<p>
“Señor, I know not why your worship wants to attempt this so dreadful
adventure; it is night now, no one sees us here, we can easily turn about
and take ourselves out of danger, even if we don’t drink for three days to
come; and as there is no one to see us, all the less will there be anyone
to set us down as cowards; besides, I have many a time heard the curate of
our village, whom your worship knows well, preach that he who seeks danger
perishes in it; so it is not right to tempt God by trying so tremendous a
feat from which there can be no escape save by a miracle, and Heaven has
performed enough of them for your worship in delivering you from being
blanketed as I was, and bringing you out victorious and safe and sound
from among all those enemies that were with the dead man; and if all this
does not move or soften that hard heart, let this thought and reflection
move it, that you will have hardly quitted this spot when from pure fear I
shall yield my soul up to anyone that will take it. I left home and wife
and children to come and serve your worship, trusting to do better and not
worse; but as covetousness bursts the bag, it has rent my hopes asunder,
for just as I had them highest about getting that wretched unlucky island
your worship has so often promised me, I see that instead and in lieu of
it you mean to desert me now in a place so far from human reach: for God’s
sake, master mine, deal not so unjustly by me, and if your worship will
not entirely give up attempting this feat, at least put it off till
morning, for by what the lore I learned when I was a shepherd tells me it
cannot want three hours of dawn now, because the mouth of the Horn is
overhead and makes midnight in the line of the left arm.”
</p>
<p>
“How canst thou see, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “where it makes that line,
or where this mouth or this occiput is that thou talkest of, when the
night is so dark that there is not a star to be seen in the whole heaven?”
</p>
<p>
“That’s true,” said Sancho, “but fear has sharp eyes, and sees things
underground, much more above in heavens; besides, there is good reason to
show that it now wants but little of day.”
</p>
<p>
“Let it want what it may,” replied Don Quixote, “it shall not be said of
me now or at any time that tears or entreaties turned me aside from doing
what was in accordance with knightly usage; and so I beg of thee, Sancho,
to hold thy peace, for God, who has put it into my heart to undertake now
this so unexampled and terrible adventure, will take care to watch over my
safety and console thy sorrow; what thou hast to do is to tighten
Rocinante’s girths well, and wait here, for I shall come back shortly,
alive or dead.”
</p>
<p>
Sancho perceiving it his master’s final resolve, and how little his tears,
counsels, and entreaties prevailed with him, determined to have recourse
to his own ingenuity and compel him, if he could, to wait till daylight;
and so, while tightening the girths of the horse, he quietly and without
being felt, with his ass’ halter tied both Rocinante’s legs, so that when
Don Quixote strove to go he was unable as the horse could only move by
jumps. Seeing the success of his trick, Sancho Panza said:
</p>
<p>
“See there, señor! Heaven, moved by my tears and prayers, has so ordered
it that Rocinante cannot stir; and if you will be obstinate, and spur and
strike him, you will only provoke fortune, and kick, as they say, against
the pricks.”
</p>
<p>
Don Quixote at this grew desperate, but the more he drove his heels into
the horse, the less he stirred him; and not having any suspicion of the
tying, he was fain to resign himself and wait till daybreak or until
Rocinante could move, firmly persuaded that all this came of something
other than Sancho’s ingenuity. So he said to him, “As it is so, Sancho,
and as Rocinante cannot move, I am content to wait till dawn smiles upon
us, even though I weep while it delays its coming.”
</p>
<p>
“There is no need to weep,” answered Sancho, “for I will amuse your
worship by telling stories from this till daylight, unless indeed you like
to dismount and lie down to sleep a little on the green grass after the
fashion of knights-errant, so as to be fresher when day comes and the
moment arrives for attempting this extraordinary adventure you are looking
forward to.”
</p>
<p>
“What art thou talking about dismounting or sleeping for?” said Don
Quixote. “Am I, thinkest thou, one of those knights that take their rest
in the presence of danger? Sleep thou who art born to sleep, or do as thou
wilt, for I will act as I think most consistent with my character.”
</p>
<p>
“Be not angry, master mine,” replied Sancho, “I did not mean to say that;”
and coming close to him he laid one hand on the pommel of the saddle and
the other on the cantle so that he held his master’s left thigh in his
embrace, not daring to separate a finger’s width from him; so much afraid
was he of the strokes which still resounded with a regular beat. Don
Quixote bade him tell some story to amuse him as he had proposed, to which
Sancho replied that he would if his dread of what he heard would let him;
“Still,” said he, “I will strive to tell a story which, if I can manage to
relate it, and nobody interferes with the telling, is the best of stories,
and let your worship give me your attention, for here I begin. What was,
was; and may the good that is to come be for all, and the evil for him who
goes to look for it—your worship must know that the beginning the
old folk used to put to their tales was not just as each one pleased; it
was a maxim of Cato Zonzorino the Roman, that says ‘the evil for him that
goes to look for it,’ and it comes as pat to the purpose now as ring to
finger, to show that your worship should keep quiet and not go looking for
evil in any quarter, and that we should go back by some other road, since
nobody forces us to follow this in which so many terrors affright us.”
</p>
<p>
“Go on with thy story, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “and leave the choice of
our road to my care.”
</p>
<p>
“I say then,” continued Sancho, “that in a village of Estremadura there
was a goat-shepherd—that is to say, one who tended goats—which
shepherd or goatherd, as my story goes, was called Lope Ruiz, and this
Lope Ruiz was in love with a shepherdess called Torralva, which
shepherdess called Torralva was the daughter of a rich grazier, and this
rich grazier—”
</p>
<p>
“If that is the way thou tellest thy tale, Sancho,” said Don Quixote,
“repeating twice all thou hast to say, thou wilt not have done these two
days; go straight on with it, and tell it like a reasonable man, or else
say nothing.”
</p>
<p>
“Tales are always told in my country in the very way I am telling this,”
answered Sancho, “and I cannot tell it in any other, nor is it right of
your worship to ask me to make new customs.”
</p>
<p>
“Tell it as thou wilt,” replied Don Quixote; “and as fate will have it
that I cannot help listening to thee, go on.”
</p>
<p>
“And so, lord of my soul,” continued Sancho, as I have said, this shepherd
was in love with Torralva the shepherdess, who was a wild buxom lass with
something of the look of a man about her, for she had little moustaches; I
fancy I see her now.”
</p>
<p>
“Then you knew her?” said Don Quixote.
</p>
<p>
“I did not know her,” said Sancho, “but he who told me the story said it
was so true and certain that when I told it to another I might safely
declare and swear I had seen it all myself. And so in course of time, the
devil, who never sleeps and puts everything in confusion, contrived that
the love the shepherd bore the shepherdess turned into hatred and
ill-will, and the reason, according to evil tongues, was some little
jealousy she caused him that crossed the line and trespassed on forbidden
ground; and so much did the shepherd hate her from that time forward that,
in order to escape from her, he determined to quit the country and go
where he should never set eyes on her again. Torralva, when she found
herself spurned by Lope, was immediately smitten with love for him, though
she had never loved him before.”
</p>
<p>
“That is the natural way of women,” said Don Quixote, “to scorn the one
that loves them, and love the one that hates them: go on, Sancho.”
</p>
<p>
“It came to pass,” said Sancho, “that the shepherd carried out his
intention, and driving his goats before him took his way across the plains
of Estremadura to pass over into the Kingdom of Portugal. Torralva, who
knew of it, went after him, and on foot and barefoot followed him at a
distance, with a pilgrim’s staff in her hand and a scrip round her neck,
in which she carried, it is said, a bit of looking-glass and a piece of a
comb and some little pot or other of paint for her face; but let her carry
what she did, I am not going to trouble myself to prove it; all I say is,
that the shepherd, they say, came with his flock to cross over the river
Guadiana, which was at that time swollen and almost overflowing its banks,
and at the spot he came to there was neither ferry nor boat nor anyone to
carry him or his flock to the other side, at which he was much vexed, for
he perceived that Torralva was approaching and would give him great
annoyance with her tears and entreaties; however, he went looking about so
closely that he discovered a fisherman who had alongside of him a boat so
small that it could only hold one person and one goat; but for all that he
spoke to him and agreed with him to carry himself and his three hundred
goats across. The fisherman got into the boat and carried one goat over;
he came back and carried another over; he came back again, and again
brought over another—let your worship keep count of the goats the
fisherman is taking across, for if one escapes the memory there will be an
end of the story, and it will be impossible to tell another word of it. To
proceed, I must tell you the landing place on the other side was miry and
slippery, and the fisherman lost a great deal of time in going and coming;
still he returned for another goat, and another, and another.”
</p>
<p>
“Take it for granted he brought them all across,” said Don Quixote, “and
don’t keep going and coming in this way, or thou wilt not make an end of
bringing them over this twelvemonth.”
</p>
<p>
“How many have gone across so far?” said Sancho.
</p>
<p>
“How the devil do I know?” replied Don Quixote.
</p>
<p>
“There it is,” said Sancho, “what I told you, that you must keep a good
count; well then, by God, there is an end of the story, for there is no
going any farther.”
</p>
<p>
“How can that be?” said Don Quixote; “is it so essential to the story to
know to a nicety the goats that have crossed over, that if there be a
mistake of one in the reckoning, thou canst not go on with it?”
</p>
<p>
“No, señor, not a bit,” replied Sancho; “for when I asked your worship to
tell me how many goats had crossed, and you answered you did not know, at
that very instant all I had to say passed away out of my memory, and,
faith, there was much virtue in it, and entertainment.”
</p>
<p>
“So, then,” said Don Quixote, “the story has come to an end?”
</p>
<p>
“As much as my mother has,” said Sancho.
</p>
<p>
“In truth,” said Don Quixote, “thou hast told one of the rarest stories,
tales, or histories, that anyone in the world could have imagined, and
such a way of telling it and ending it was never seen nor will be in a
lifetime; though I expected nothing else from thy excellent understanding.
But I do not wonder, for perhaps those ceaseless strokes may have confused
thy wits.”
</p>
<p>
“All that may be,” replied Sancho, “but I know that as to my story, all
that can be said is that it ends there where the mistake in the count of
the passage of the goats begins.”
</p>
<p>
“Let it end where it will, well and good,” said Don Quixote, “and let us
“Señor, you have ended this perilous adventure more safely for yourself
see if Rocinante can go;” and again he spurred him, and again Rocinante
made jumps and remained where he was, so well tied was he.
</p>
<p>
Just then, whether it was the cold of the morning that was now
approaching, or that he had eaten something laxative at supper, or that it
was only natural (as is most likely), Sancho felt a desire to do what no
one could do for him; but so great was the fear that had penetrated his
heart, he dared not separate himself from his master by as much as the
black of his nail; to escape doing what he wanted was, however, also
impossible; so what he did for peace’s sake was to remove his right hand,
which held the back of the saddle, and with it to untie gently and
silently the running string which alone held up his breeches, so that on
loosening it they at once fell down round his feet like fetters; he then
raised his shirt as well as he could and bared his hind quarters, no slim
ones. But, this accomplished, which he fancied was all he had to do to get
out of this terrible strait and embarrassment, another still greater
difficulty presented itself, for it seemed to him impossible to relieve
himself without making some noise, and he ground his teeth and squeezed
his shoulders together, holding his breath as much as he could; but in
spite of his precautions he was unlucky enough after all to make a little
noise, very different from that which was causing him so much fear.
</p>

<br><br><br>
</p>
<p>
Don Quixote, hearing it, said, “What noise is that, Sancho?”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know, señor,” said he; “it must be something new, for adventures
and misadventures never begin with a trifle.” Once more he tried his luck,
and succeeded so well, that without any further noise or disturbance he
found himself relieved of the burden that had given him so much
discomfort. But as Don Quixote’s sense of smell was as acute as his
hearing, and as Sancho was so closely linked with him that the fumes rose
almost in a straight line, it could not be but that some should reach his
nose, and as soon as they did he came to its relief by compressing it
between his fingers, saying in a rather snuffing tone, “Sancho, it strikes
me thou art in great fear.”
</p>
<p>
“I am,” answered Sancho; “but how does your worship perceive it now more
than ever?”
</p>
<p>
“Because just now thou smellest stronger than ever, and not of ambergris,”
answered Don Quixote.
</p>
<p>
“Very likely,” said Sancho, “but that’s not my fault, but your worship’s,
for leading me about at unseasonable hours and at such unwonted paces.”
</p>
<p>
“Then go back three or four, my friend,” said Don Quixote, all the time
with his fingers to his nose; “and for the future pay more attention to
thy person and to what thou owest to mine; for it is my great familiarity
with thee that has bred this contempt.”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll bet,” replied Sancho, “that your worship thinks I have done
something I ought not with my person.”
</p>
<p>
“It makes it worse to stir it, friend Sancho,” returned Don Quixote.
</p>
<p>
With this and other talk of the same sort master and man passed the night,
till Sancho, perceiving that daybreak was coming on apace, very cautiously
untied Rocinante and tied up his breeches. As soon as Rocinante found
himself free, though by nature he was not at all mettlesome, he seemed to
feel lively and began pawing—for as to capering, begging his pardon,
he knew not what it meant. Don Quixote, then, observing that Rocinante
could move, took it as a good sign and a signal that he should attempt the
dread adventure. By this time day had fully broken and everything showed
distinctly, and Don Quixote saw that he was among some tall trees,
chestnuts, which cast a very deep shade; he perceived likewise that the
sound of the strokes did not cease, but could not discover what caused it,
and so without any further delay he let Rocinante feel the spur, and once
more taking leave of Sancho, he told him to wait for him there three days
at most, as he had said before, and if he should not have returned by that
time, he might feel sure it had been God’s will that he should end his
days in that perilous adventure. He again repeated the message and
commission with which he was to go on his behalf to his lady Dulcinea, and
said he was not to be uneasy as to the payment of his services, for before
leaving home he had made his will, in which he would find himself fully
recompensed in the matter of wages in due proportion to the time he had
served; but if God delivered him safe, sound, and unhurt out of that
danger, he might look upon the promised island as much more than certain.
Sancho began to weep afresh on again hearing the affecting words of his
good master, and resolved to stay with him until the final issue and end
of the business. From these tears and this honourable resolve of Sancho
Panza’s the author of this history infers that he must have been of good
birth and at least an old Christian; and the feeling he displayed touched
his but not so much as to make him show any weakness; on the contrary,
hiding what he felt as well as he could, he began to move towards that
quarter whence the sound of the water and of the strokes seemed to come.
</p>
<p>
Sancho followed him on foot, leading by the halter, as his custom was, his
ass, his constant comrade in prosperity or adversity; and advancing some
distance through the shady chestnut trees they came upon a little meadow
at the foot of some high rocks, down which a mighty rush of water flung
itself. At the foot of the rocks were some rudely constructed houses
looking more like ruins than houses, from among which came, they
perceived, the din and clatter of blows, which still continued without
intermission. Rocinante took fright at the noise of the water and of the
blows, but quieting him Don Quixote advanced step by step towards the
houses, commending himself with all his heart to his lady, imploring her
support in that dread pass and enterprise, and on the way commending
himself to God, too, not to forget him. Sancho who never quitted his side,
stretched his neck as far as he could and peered between the legs of
Rocinante to see if he could now discover what it was that caused him such
fear and apprehension. They went it might be a hundred paces farther, when
on turning a corner the true cause, beyond the possibility of any mistake,
of that dread-sounding and to them awe-inspiring noise that had kept them
all the night in such fear and perplexity, appeared plain and obvious; and
it was (if, reader, thou art not disgusted and disappointed) six fulling
hammers which by their alternate strokes made all the din.
</p>
<p>
When Don Quixote perceived what it was, he was struck dumb and rigid from
head to foot. Sancho glanced at him and saw him with his head bent down
upon his breast in manifest mortification; and Don Quixote glanced at
Sancho and saw him with his cheeks puffed out and his mouth full of
laughter, and evidently ready to explode with it, and in spite of his
vexation he could not help laughing at the sight of him; and when Sancho
saw his master begin he let go so heartily that he had to hold his sides
with both hands to keep himself from bursting with laughter. Four times he
stopped, and as many times did his laughter break out afresh with the same
violence as at first, whereat Don Quixote grew furious, above all when he
heard him say mockingly, “Thou must know, friend Sancho, that of Heaven’s
will I was born in this our iron age to revive in it the golden or age of
gold; I am he for whom are reserved perils, mighty achievements, valiant
deeds;” and here he went on repeating the words that Don Quixote uttered
the first time they heard the awful strokes.
</p>
<p>
Don Quixote, then, seeing that Sancho was turning him into ridicule, was
so mortified and vexed that he lifted up his pike and smote him two such
blows that if, instead of catching them on his shoulders, he had caught
them on his head there would have been no wages to pay, unless indeed to
his heirs. Sancho seeing that he was getting an awkward return in earnest
for his jest, and fearing his master might carry it still further, said to
him very humbly, “Calm yourself, sir, for by God I am only joking.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, then, if you are joking I am not,” replied Don Quixote. “Look here,
my lively gentleman, if these, instead of being fulling hammers, had been
some perilous adventure, have I not, think you, shown the courage required
for the attempt and achievement? Am I, perchance, being, as I am, a
gentleman, bound to know and distinguish sounds and tell whether they come
from fulling mills or not; and that, when perhaps, as is the case, I have
never in my life seen any as you have, low boor as you are, that have been
born and bred among them? But turn me these six hammers into six giants,
and bring them to beard me, one by one or all together, and if I do not
knock them head over heels, then make what mockery you like of me.”
</p>
<p>
“No more of that, señor,” returned Sancho; “I own I went a little too far
with the joke. But tell me, your worship, now that peace is made between
us (and may God bring you out of all the adventures that may befall you as
safe and sound as he has brought you out of this one), was it not a thing
to laugh at, and is it not a good story, the great fear we were in?—at
least that I was in; for as to your worship I see now that you neither
know nor understand what either fear or dismay is.”
</p>
<p>
“I do not deny,” said Don Quixote, “that what happened to us may be worth
laughing at, but it is not worth making a story about, for it is not
everyone that is shrewd enough to hit the right point of a thing.”
</p>
<p>
“At any rate,” said Sancho, “your worship knew how to hit the right point
with your pike, aiming at my head and hitting me on the shoulders, thanks
be to God and my own smartness in dodging it. But let that pass; all will
come out in the scouring; for I have heard say ‘he loves thee well that
makes thee weep;’ and moreover that it is the way with great lords after
any hard words they give a servant to give him a pair of breeches; though
I do not know what they give after blows, unless it be that knights-errant
after blows give islands, or kingdoms on the mainland.”
</p>
<p>
“It may be on the dice,” said Don Quixote, “that all thou sayest will come
true; overlook the past, for thou art shrewd enough to know that our first
movements are not in our own control; and one thing for the future bear in
mind, that thou curb and restrain thy loquacity in my company; for in all
the books of chivalry that I have read, and they are innumerable, I never
met with a squire who talked so much to his lord as thou dost to thine;
and in fact I feel it to be a great fault of thine and of mine: of thine,
that thou hast so little respect for me; of mine, that I do not make
myself more respected. There was Gandalin, the squire of Amadis of Gaul,
that was Count of the Insula Firme, and we read of him that he always
addressed his lord with his cap in his hand, his head bowed down and his
body bent double, more turquesco. And then, what shall we say of Gasabal,
the squire of Galaor, who was so silent that in order to indicate to us
the greatness of his marvellous taciturnity his name is only once
mentioned in the whole of that history, as long as it is truthful? From
all I have said thou wilt gather, Sancho, that there must be a difference
between master and man, between lord and lackey, between knight and
squire: so that from this day forward in our intercourse we must observe
more respect and take less liberties, for in whatever way I may be
provoked with you it will be bad for the pitcher. The favours and benefits
that I have promised you will come in due time, and if they do not your
wages at least will not be lost, as I have already told you.”
</p>
<p>
“All that your worship says is very well,” said Sancho, “but I should like
to know (in case the time of favours should not come, and it might be
necessary to fall back upon wages) how much did the squire of a
knight-errant get in those days, and did they agree by the month, or by
the day like bricklayers?”
</p>
<p>
“I do not believe,” replied Don Quixote, “that such squires were ever on
wages, but were dependent on favour; and if I have now mentioned thine in
the sealed will I have left at home, it was with a view to what may
happen; for as yet I know not how chivalry will turn out in these wretched
times of ours, and I do not wish my soul to suffer for trifles in the
other world; for I would have thee know, Sancho, that in this there is no
condition more hazardous than that of adventurers.”
</p>
<p>
“That is true,” said Sancho, “since the mere noise of the hammers of a
fulling mill can disturb and disquiet the heart of such a valiant errant
adventurer as your worship; but you may be sure I will not open my lips
henceforward to make light of anything of your worship’s, but only to
honour you as my master and natural lord.”
</p>
<p>
“By so doing,” replied Don Quixote, “shalt thou live long on the face of
the earth; for next to parents, masters are to be respected as though they
were parents.”

It now began to rain a little, and Sancho was for going into the fulling
mills, but Don Quixote had taken such an abhorrence to them on account of
the late joke that he would not enter them on any account; so turning
aside to right they came upon another road, different from that which they
had taken the night before. Shortly afterwards Don Quixote perceived a man
on horseback who wore on his head something that shone like gold, and the
moment he saw him he turned to Sancho and said:
</p>
<p>
“I think, Sancho, there is no proverb that is not true, all being maxims
drawn from experience itself, the mother of all the sciences, especially
that one that says, ‘Where one door shuts, another opens.’ I say so
because if last night fortune shut the door of the adventure we were
looking for against us, cheating us with the fulling mills, it now opens
wide another one for another better and more certain adventure, and if I
do not contrive to enter it, it will be my own fault, and I cannot lay it
to my ignorance of fulling mills, or the darkness of the night. I say this
because, if I mistake not, there comes towards us one who wears on his
head the helmet of Mambrino, concerning which I took the oath thou
rememberest.”
</p>
<p>
“Mind what you say, your worship, and still more what you do,” said
Sancho, “for I don’t want any more fulling mills to finish off fulling and
knocking our senses out.”
</p>
<p>
“The devil take thee, man,” said Don Quixote; “what has a helmet to do
with fulling mills?”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know,” replied Sancho, “but, faith, if I might speak as I used,
perhaps I could give such reasons that your worship would see you were
mistaken in what you say.”
</p>
<p>
“How can I be mistaken in what I say, unbelieving traitor?” returned Don
Quixote; “tell me, seest thou not yonder knight coming towards us on a
dappled grey steed, who has upon his head a helmet of gold?”
</p>
<p>
“What I see and make out,” answered Sancho, “is only a man on a grey ass
like my own, who has something that shines on his head.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, that is the helmet of Mambrino,” said Don Quixote; “stand to one
side and leave me alone with him; thou shalt see how, without saying a
word, to save time, I shall bring this adventure to an issue and possess
myself of the helmet I have so longed for.”
</p>
<p>
“I will take care to stand aside,” said Sancho; “but God grant, I say once
more, that it may be marjoram and not fulling mills.”
</p>
<p>
“I have told thee, brother, on no account to mention those fulling mills
to me again,” said Don Quixote, “or I vow—and I say no more—I’ll
full the soul out of you.”
</p>
<p>
Sancho held his peace in dread lest his master should carry out the vow he
had hurled like a bowl at him.
</p>
<p>
The fact of the matter as regards the helmet, steed, and knight that Don
Quixote saw, was this. In that neighbourhood there were two villages, one
of them so small that it had neither apothecary’s shop nor barber, which
the other that was close to it had, so the barber of the larger served the
smaller, and in it there was a sick man who required to be bled and
another man who wanted to be shaved, and on this errand the barber was
going, carrying with him a brass basin; but as luck would have it, as he
was on the way it began to rain, and not to spoil his hat, which probably
was a new one, he put the basin on his head, and being clean it glittered
at half a league’s distance. He rode upon a grey ass, as Sancho said, and
this was what made it seem to Don Quixote to be a dapple-grey steed and a
knight and a golden helmet; for everything he saw he made to fall in with
his crazy chivalry and ill-errant notions; and when he saw the poor knight
draw near, without entering into any parley with him, at Rocinante’s top
speed he bore down upon him with the pike pointed low, fully determined to
run him through and through, and as he reached him, without checking the
fury of his charge, he cried to him:
</p>
<p>
“Defend thyself, miserable being, or yield me of thine own accord that
which is so reasonably my due.”
</p>
<p>
The barber, who without any expectation or apprehension of it saw this
apparition coming down upon him, had no other way of saving himself from
the stroke of the lance but to let himself fall off his ass; and no sooner
had he touched the ground than he sprang up more nimbly than a deer and
sped away across the plain faster than the wind.
</p>
<p>
He left the basin on the ground, with which Don Quixote contented himself,
saying that the pagan had shown his discretion and imitated the beaver,
which finding itself pressed by the hunters bites and cuts off with its
teeth that for which, by its natural instinct, it knows it is pursued.
</p>
<p>
He told Sancho to pick up the helmet, and he taking it in his hands said:
</p>
<p>
“By God the basin is a good one, and worth a real of eight if it is worth
a maravedis,” and handed it to his master, who immediately put it on his
head, turning it round, now this way, now that, in search of fitment, and
not finding it he said, “Clearly the pagan to whose measure this famous
head-piece was first forged must have had a very large head; but the worst
of it is half of it is wanting.”
</p>
<p>
When Sancho heard him call the basin a headpiece he was unable to restrain
his laughter, but remembering his master’s wrath he checked himself in the
midst of it.
</p>
<p>
“What art thou laughing at, Sancho?” said Don Quixote.
</p>
<p>
“I am laughing,” said he, “to think of the great head the pagan must have
had who owned this helmet, for it looks exactly like a regular barber’s
basin.”
</p>
<p>
“Dost thou know what I suspect, Sancho?” said Don Quixote; “that this
wonderful piece of this enchanted helmet must by some strange accident
have come into the hands of someone who was unable to recognise or
realise its value, and who, not knowing what he did, and seeing it to be
of the purest gold, must have melted down one half for the sake of what it
might be worth, and of the other made this which is like a barber’s basin
as thou sayest; but be it as it may, to me who recognise it, its
transformation makes no difference, for I will set it to rights at the
first village where there is a blacksmith, and in such style that that
helmet the god of smithies forged for the god of battles shall not surpass
it or even come up to it; and in the meantime I will wear it as well as I
can, for something is better than nothing; all the more as it will be
quite enough to protect me from any chance blow of a stone.”
</p>
<p>
“That is,” said Sancho, “if it is not shot with a sling as they were in
the battle of the two armies, when they signed the cross on your worship’s
grinders and smashed the flask with that blessed draught that made me
vomit my bowels up.”
</p>
<p>
“It does not grieve me much to have lost it,” said Don Quixote, “for thou
knowest, Sancho, that I have the receipt in my memory.”
</p>
<p>
“So have I,” answered Sancho, “but if ever I make it, or try it again as
long as I live, may this be my last hour; moreover, I have no intention of
putting myself in the way of wanting it, for I mean, with all my five
senses, to keep myself from being wounded or from wounding anyone: as to
being blanketed again I say nothing, for it is hard to prevent mishaps of
that sort, and if they come there is nothing for it but to squeeze our
shoulders together, hold our breath, shut our eyes, and let ourselves go
where luck and the blanket may send us.”
</p>
<p>
“Thou art a bad Christian, Sancho,” said Don Quixote on hearing this, “for
once an injury has been done thee thou never forgettest it: but know that
it is the part of noble and generous hearts not to attach importance to
trifles. What lame leg hast thou got by it, what broken rib, what cracked
head, that thou canst not forget that jest? For jest and sport it was,
properly regarded, and had I not seen it in that light I would have
returned and done more mischief in revenging thee than the Greeks did for
the rape of Helen, who, if she were alive now, or if my Dulcinea had lived
then, might depend upon it she would not be so famous for her beauty as
she is;” and here he heaved a sigh and sent it aloft; and said Sancho,
“Let it pass for a jest as it cannot be revenged in earnest, but I know
what sort of jest and earnest it was, and I know it will never be rubbed
out of my memory any more than off my shoulders. But putting that aside,
will your worship tell me what are we to do with this dapple-grey steed
that looks like a grey ass, which that Martino that your worship overthrew
has left deserted here? for, from the way he took to his heels and bolted,
he is not likely ever to come back for it; and by my beard but the grey is
a good one.”
</p>
<p>
“I have never been in the habit,” said Don Quixote, “of taking spoil of
those whom I vanquish, nor is it the practice of chivalry to take away
their horses and leave them to go on foot, unless indeed it be that the
victor have lost his own in the combat, in which case it is lawful to take
that of the vanquished as a thing won in lawful war; therefore, Sancho,
leave this horse, or ass, or whatever thou wilt have it to be; for when
its owner sees us gone hence he will come back for it.”
</p>
<p>
“God knows I should like to take it,” returned Sancho, “or at least to
change it for my own, which does not seem to me as good a one: verily the
laws of chivalry are strict, since they cannot be stretched to let one ass
be changed for another; I should like to know if I might at least change
trappings.”
</p>
<p>
“On that head I am not quite certain,” answered Don Quixote, “and the
matter being doubtful, pending better information, I say thou mayest
change them, if so be thou hast urgent need of them.”
</p>
<p>
“So urgent is it,” answered Sancho, “that if they were for my
own person I could not want them more;” and forthwith, fortified by this
licence, he effected the <i>mutatio capparum</i>, and rigged out his beast to
the ninety-nines and making quite another thing of it. This done, they broke
their fast on the remains of the spoils of war plundered from the sumpter mule,
and drank of the brook that flowed from the fulling mills, without casting a
look in that direction, in such loathing did they hold them for the alarm they
had caused them; and, all anger and gloom removed, they mounted and, without
taking any fixed road (not to fix upon any being the proper thing for true
knights-errant), they set out, guided by Rocinante’s will, which carried
along with it that of his master, not to say that of the ass, which always
followed him wherever he led, lovingly and sociably; nevertheless they returned
to the high road, and pursued it at a venture without any other aim.
</p>
<p>
As they went along, then, in this way Sancho said to his master, “Señor,
would your worship give me leave to speak a little to you? For since you
laid that hard injunction of silence on me several things have gone to rot
in my stomach, and I have now just one on the tip of my tongue that I
don’t want to be spoiled.”
</p>
<p>
“Say, on, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “and be brief in thy discourse, for
there is no pleasure in one that is long.”
</p>
<p>
“Well then, señor,” returned Sancho, “I say that for some days past I have
been considering how little is got or gained by going in search of these
adventures that your worship seeks in these wilds and cross-roads, where,
even if the most perilous are victoriously achieved, there is no one to
see or know of them, and so they must be left untold for ever, to the loss
of your worship’s object and the credit they deserve; therefore it seems
to me it would be better (saving your worship’s better judgment) if we
were to go and serve some emperor or other great prince who may have some
war on hand, in whose service your worship may prove the worth of your
person, your great might, and greater understanding, on perceiving which
the lord in whose service we may be will perforce have to reward us, each
according to his merits; and there you will not be at a loss for someone
to set down your achievements in writing so as to preserve their memory
for ever. Of my own I say nothing, as they will not go beyond squirely
limits, though I make bold to say that, if it be the practice in chivalry
to write the achievements of squires, I think mine must not be left out.”
</p>
<p>
“Thou speakest not amiss, Sancho,” answered Don Quixote, “but
before that point is reached it is requisite to roam the world, as it were on
probation, seeking adventures, in order that, by achieving some, name and fame
may be acquired, such that when he betakes himself to the court of some great
monarch the knight may be already known by his deeds, and that the boys, the
instant they see him enter the gate of the city, may all follow him and
surround him, crying, ‘This is the Knight of the Sun’—or the
Serpent, or any other title under which he may have achieved great deeds.
‘This,’ they will say, ‘is he who vanquished in single combat
the gigantic Brocabruno of mighty strength; he who delivered the great Mameluke
of Persia out of the long enchantment under which he had been for almost nine
hundred years.’ So from one to another they will go proclaiming his
achievements; and presently at the tumult of the boys and the others the king
of that kingdom will appear at the windows of his royal palace, and as soon as
he beholds the knight, recognising him by his arms and the device on his
shield, he will as a matter of course say, ‘What ho! Forth all ye, the
knights of my court, to receive the flower of chivalry who cometh
hither!’ At which command all will issue forth, and he himself, advancing
half-way down the stairs, will embrace him closely, and salute him, kissing him
on the cheek, and will then lead him to the queen’s chamber, where the
knight will find her with the princess her daughter, who will be one of the
most beautiful and accomplished damsels that could with the utmost pains be
discovered anywhere in the known world. Straightway it will come to pass that
she will fix her eyes upon the knight and he his upon her, and each will seem
to the other something more divine than human, and, without knowing how or why
they will be taken and entangled in the inextricable toils of love, and sorely
distressed in their hearts not to see any way of making their pains and
sufferings known by speech. Thence they will lead him, no doubt, to some richly
adorned chamber of the palace, where, having removed his armour, they will
bring him a rich mantle of scarlet wherewith to robe himself, and if he looked
noble in his armour he will look still more so in a doublet. When night comes
he will sup with the king, queen, and princess; and all the time he will never
take his eyes off her, stealing stealthy glances, unnoticed by those present,
and she will do the same, and with equal cautiousness, being, as I have said, a
damsel of great discretion. The tables being removed, suddenly through the door
of the hall there will enter a hideous and diminutive dwarf followed by a fair
dame, between two giants, who comes with a certain adventure, the work of an
ancient sage; and he who shall achieve it shall be deemed the best knight in
the world.
</p>
<p>
“The king will then command all those present to essay it, and none will
bring it to an end and conclusion save the stranger knight, to the great
enhancement of his fame, whereat the princess will be overjoyed and will
esteem herself happy and fortunate in having fixed and placed her thoughts
so high. And the best of it is that this king, or prince, or whatever he
is, is engaged in a very bitter war with another as powerful as himself,
and the stranger knight, after having been some days at his court,
requests leave from him to go and serve him in the said war. The king will
grant it very readily, and the knight will courteously kiss his hands for
the favour done to him; and that night he will take leave of his lady the
princess at the grating of the chamber where she sleeps, which looks upon
a garden, and at which he has already many times conversed with her, the
go-between and confidante in the matter being a damsel much trusted by the
princess. He will sigh, she will swoon, the damsel will fetch water, much
distressed because morning approaches, and for the honour of her lady he
would not that they were discovered; at last the princess will come to
herself and will present her white hands through the grating to the
knight, who will kiss them a thousand and a thousand times, bathing them
with his tears. It will be arranged between them how they are to inform
each other of their good or evil fortunes, and the princess will entreat
him to make his absence as short as possible, which he will promise to do
with many oaths; once more he kisses her hands, and takes his leave in
such grief that he is well-nigh ready to die. He betakes him thence to his
chamber, flings himself on his bed, cannot sleep for sorrow at parting,
rises early in the morning, goes to take leave of the king, queen, and
princess, and, as he takes his leave of the pair, it is told him that the
princess is indisposed and cannot receive a visit; the knight thinks it is
from grief at his departure, his heart is pierced, and he is hardly able
to keep from showing his pain. The confidante is present, observes all,
goes to tell her mistress, who listens with tears and says that one of her
greatest distresses is not knowing who this knight is, and whether he is
of kingly lineage or not; the damsel assures her that so much courtesy,
gentleness, and gallantry of bearing as her knight possesses could not
exist in any save one who was royal and illustrious; her anxiety is thus
relieved, and she strives to be of good cheer lest she should excite
suspicion in her parents, and at the end of two days she appears in
public. Meanwhile the knight has taken his departure; he fights in the
war, conquers the king’s enemy, wins many cities, triumphs in many
battles, returns to the court, sees his lady where he was wont to see her,
and it is agreed that he shall demand her in marriage of her parents as
the reward of his services; the king is unwilling to give her, as he knows
not who he is, but nevertheless, whether carried off or in whatever other
way it may be, the princess comes to be his bride, and her father comes to
regard it as very good fortune; for it so happens that this knight is
proved to be the son of a valiant king of some kingdom, I know not what,
for I fancy it is not likely to be on the map. The father dies, the
princess inherits, and in two words the knight becomes king. And here
comes in at once the bestowal of rewards upon his squire and all who have
aided him in rising to so exalted a rank. He marries his squire to a
damsel of the princess’s, who will be, no doubt, the one who was
confidante in their amour, and is daughter of a very great duke.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s what I want, and no mistake about it!” said Sancho. “That’s what
I’m waiting for; for all this, word for word, is in store for your worship
under the title of the Knight of the Rueful Countenance.”
</p>
<p>
“Thou needst not doubt it, Sancho,” replied Don Quixote, “for in the same
manner, and by the same steps as I have described here, knights-errant
rise and have risen to be kings and emperors; all we want now is to find
out what king, Christian or pagan, is at war and has a beautiful daughter;
but there will be time enough to think of that, for, as I have told thee,
fame must be won in other quarters before repairing to the court. There is
another thing, too, that is wanting; for supposing we find a king who is
at war and has a beautiful daughter, and that I have won incredible fame
throughout the universe, I know not how it can be made out that I am of
royal lineage, or even second cousin to an emperor; for the king will not
be willing to give me his daughter in marriage unless he is first
thoroughly satisfied on this point, however much my famous deeds may
deserve it; so that by this deficiency I fear I shall lose what my arm has
fairly earned. True it is I am a gentleman of known house, of estate and
property, and entitled to the five hundred sueldos mulet; and it may be
that the sage who shall write my history will so clear up my ancestry and
pedigree that I may find myself fifth or sixth in descent from a king; for
I would have thee know, Sancho, that there are two kinds of lineages in
the world; some there be tracing and deriving their descent from kings and
princes, whom time has reduced little by little until they end in a point
like a pyramid upside down; and others who spring from the common herd and
go on rising step by step until they come to be great lords; so that the
difference is that the one were what they no longer are, and the others
are what they formerly were not. And I may be of such that after
investigation my origin may prove great and famous, with which the king,
my father-in-law that is to be, ought to be satisfied; and should he not
be, the princess will so love me that even though she well knew me to be
the son of a water-carrier, she will take me for her lord and husband in
spite of her father; if not, then it comes to seizing her and carrying her
off where I please; for time or death will put an end to the wrath of her
parents.”
</p>
<p>
“It comes to this, too,” said Sancho, “what some naughty people say,
‘Never ask as a favour what thou canst take by force;’ though it would fit
better to say, ‘A clear escape is better than good men’s prayers.’ I say
so because if my lord the king, your worship’s father-in-law, will not
condescend to give you my lady the princess, there is nothing for it but,
as your worship says, to seize her and transport her. But the mischief is
that until peace is made and you come into the peaceful enjoyment of your
kingdom, the poor squire is famishing as far as rewards go, unless it be
that the confidante damsel that is to be his wife comes with the princess,
and that with her he tides over his bad luck until Heaven otherwise orders
things; for his master, I suppose, may as well give her to him at once for
a lawful wife.”
</p>
<p>
“Nobody can object to that,” said Don Quixote.
</p>
<p>
“Then since that may be,” said Sancho, “there is nothing for it but to
commend ourselves to God, and let fortune take what course it will.”
</p>
<p>
“God guide it according to my wishes and thy wants,” said Don Quixote,
“and mean be he who thinks himself mean.”
</p>
<p>
“In God’s name let him be so,” said Sancho: “I am an old Christian, and to
fit me for a count that’s enough.”
</p>
<p>
“And more than enough for thee,” said Don Quixote; “and even wert thou
not, it would make no difference, because I being the king can easily give
thee nobility without purchase or service rendered by thee, for when I
make thee a count, then thou art at once a gentleman; and they may say
what they will, but by my faith they will have to call thee ‘your
lordship,’ whether they like it or not.”
</p>
<p>
“Not a doubt of it; and I’ll know how to support the tittle,” said Sancho.
</p>
<p>
“Title thou shouldst say, not tittle,” said his master.
</p>
<p>
“So be it,” answered Sancho. “I say I will know how to behave, for once in
my life I was beadle of a brotherhood, and the beadle’s gown sat so well
on me that all said I looked as if I was to be steward of the same
brotherhood. What will it be, then, when I put a duke’s robe on my back,
or dress myself in gold and pearls like a count? I believe they’ll come a
hundred leagues to see me.”
</p>
<p>
“Thou wilt look well,” said Don Quixote, “but thou must shave thy beard
often, for thou hast it so thick and rough and unkempt, that if thou dost
not shave it every second day at least, they will see what thou art at the
distance of a musket shot.”
</p>
<p>
“What more will it be,” said Sancho, “than having a barber, and keeping
him at wages in the house? and even if it be necessary, I will make him go
behind me like a nobleman’s equerry.”
</p>
<p>
“Why, how dost thou know that noblemen have equerries behind them?” asked
Don Quixote.
</p>
<p>
“I will tell you,” answered Sancho. “Years ago I was for a month at the
capital and there I saw taking the air a very small gentleman who they
said was a very great man, and a man following him on horseback in every
turn he took, just as if he was his tail. I asked why this man did not
join the other man, instead of always going behind him; they answered me
that he was his equerry, and that it was the custom with nobles to have
such persons behind them, and ever since then I know it, for I have never
forgotten it.”
</p>
<p>
“Thou art right,” said Don Quixote, “and in the same way thou mayest carry
thy barber with thee, for customs did not come into use all together, nor
were they all invented at once, and thou mayest be the first count to have
a barber to follow him; and, indeed, shaving one’s beard is a greater
trust than saddling one’s horse.”
</p>
<p>
“Let the barber business be my look-out,” said Sancho; “and your worship’s
be it to strive to become a king, and make me a count.”
</p>
<p>
“So it shall be,” answered Don Quixote, and raising his eyes he saw what
will be told in the following chapter.

Cid Hamete Benengeli, the Arab and Manchegan author, relates in this most
grave, high-sounding, minute, delightful, and original history that after
the discussion between the famous Don Quixote of La Mancha and his squire
Sancho Panza which is set down at the end of chapter twenty-one, Don
Quixote raised his eyes and saw coming along the road he was following
some dozen men on foot strung together by the neck, like beads, on a great
iron chain, and all with manacles on their hands. With them there came
also two men on horseback and two on foot; those on horseback with
wheel-lock muskets, those on foot with javelins and swords, and as soon as
Sancho saw them he said:
</p>
<p>
“That is a chain of galley slaves, on the way to the galleys by force of
the king’s orders.”
</p>
<p>
“How by force?” asked Don Quixote; “is it possible that the king uses
force against anyone?”
</p>
<p>
“I do not say that,” answered Sancho, “but that these are people condemned
for their crimes to serve by force in the king’s galleys.”
</p>
<p>
“In fact,” replied Don Quixote, “however it may be, these people are going
where they are taking them by force, and not of their own will.”
</p>
<p>
“Just so,” said Sancho.
</p>
<p>
“Then if so,” said Don Quixote, “here is a case for the exercise of my
office, to put down force and to succour and help the wretched.”
</p>
<p>
“Recollect, your worship,” said Sancho, “Justice, which is the king
himself, is not using force or doing wrong to such persons, but punishing
them for their crimes.”
</p>
<p>
The chain of galley slaves had by this time come up, and Don Quixote in
very courteous language asked those who were in custody of it to be good
enough to tell him the reason or reasons for which they were conducting
these people in this manner. One of the guards on horseback answered that
they were galley slaves belonging to his majesty, that they were going to
the galleys, and that was all that was to be said and all he had any
business to know.

<br><br><br>
</p>
<p>
“Nevertheless,” replied Don Quixote, “I should like to know from each of
them separately the reason of his misfortune;” to this he added more to
the same effect to induce them to tell him what he wanted so civilly that
the other mounted guard said to him:
</p>
<p>
“Though we have here the register and certificate of the sentence of every
one of these wretches, this is no time to take them out or read them; come
and ask themselves; they can tell if they choose, and they will, for these
fellows take a pleasure in doing and talking about rascalities.”
</p>
<p>
With this permission, which Don Quixote would have taken even had they not
granted it, he approached the chain and asked the first for what offences
he was now in such a sorry case.
</p>
<p>
He made answer that it was for being a lover.
</p>
<p>
“For that only?” replied Don Quixote; “why, if for being lovers they send
people to the galleys I might have been rowing in them long ago.”
</p>
<p>
“The love is not the sort your worship is thinking of,” said the galley
slave; “mine was that I loved a washerwoman’s basket of clean linen so
well, and held it so close in my embrace, that if the arm of the law had
not forced it from me, I should never have let it go of my own will to
this moment; I was caught in the act, there was no occasion for torture,
the case was settled, they treated me to a hundred lashes on the back, and
three years of gurapas besides, and that was the end of it.”
</p>
<p>
“What are gurapas?” asked Don Quixote.
</p>
<p>
“Gurapas are galleys,” answered the galley slave, who was a young man of
about four-and-twenty, and said he was a native of Piedrahita.
</p>
<p>
Don Quixote asked the same question of the second, who made no reply, so
downcast and melancholy was he; but the first answered for him, and said,
“He, sir, goes as a canary, I mean as a musician and a singer.”
</p>
<p>
“What!” said Don Quixote, “for being musicians and singers are people sent
to the galleys too?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, sir,” answered the galley slave, “for there is nothing worse than
singing under suffering.”
</p>
<p>
“On the contrary, I have heard say,” said Don Quixote, “that he who sings
scares away his woes.”
</p>
<p>
“Here it is the reverse,” said the galley slave; “for he who sings once
weeps all his life.”
</p>
<p>
“I do not understand it,” said Don Quixote; but one of the guards
said to him, “Sir, to sing under suffering means with the <i>non
sancta</i> fraternity to confess under torture; they put this sinner to the
torture and he confessed his crime, which was being a cuatrero, that is a
cattle-stealer, and on his confession they sentenced him to six years in the
galleys, besides two hundred lashes that he has already had on the back; and he
is always dejected and downcast because the other thieves that were left behind
and that march here ill-treat, and snub, and jeer, and despise him for
confessing and not having spirit enough to say nay; for, say they,
‘nay’ has no more letters in it than ‘yea,’ and a
culprit is well off when life or death with him depends on his own tongue and
not on that of witnesses or evidence; and to my thinking they are not very far
out.”
</p>
<p>
“And I think so too,” answered Don Quixote; then passing on to the third
he asked him what he had asked the others, and the man answered very
readily and unconcernedly, “I am going for five years to their ladyships
the gurapas for the want of ten ducats.”
</p>
<p>
“I will give twenty with pleasure to get you out of that trouble,” said
Don Quixote.
</p>
<p>
“That,” said the galley slave, “is like a man having money at sea when he
is dying of hunger and has no way of buying what he wants; I say so
because if at the right time I had had those twenty ducats that your
worship now offers me, I would have greased the notary’s pen and freshened
up the attorney’s wit with them, so that to-day I should be in the middle
of the plaza of the Zocodover at Toledo, and not on this road coupled like
a greyhound. But God is great; patience—there, that’s enough of it.”
</p>
<p>
Don Quixote passed on to the fourth, a man of venerable aspect with a
white beard falling below his breast, who on hearing himself asked the
reason of his being there began to weep without answering a word, but the
fifth acted as his tongue and said, “This worthy man is going to the
galleys for four years, after having gone the rounds in ceremony and on
horseback.”
</p>
<p>
“That means,” said Sancho Panza, “as I take it, to have been exposed to
shame in public.”
</p>
<p>
“Just so,” replied the galley slave, “and the offence for which they gave
him that punishment was having been an ear-broker, nay body-broker; I
mean, in short, that this gentleman goes as a pimp, and for having besides
a certain touch of the sorcerer about him.”
</p>
<p>
“If that touch had not been thrown in,” said Don Quixote, “he would not
deserve, for mere pimping, to row in the galleys, but rather to command
and be admiral of them; for the office of pimp is no ordinary one, being
the office of persons of discretion, one very necessary in a well-ordered
state, and only to be exercised by persons of good birth; nay, there ought
to be an inspector and overseer of them, as in other offices, and
recognised number, as with the brokers on change; in this way many of the
evils would be avoided which are caused by this office and calling being
in the hands of stupid and ignorant people, such as women more or less
silly, and pages and jesters of little standing and experience, who on the
most urgent occasions, and when ingenuity of contrivance is needed, let
the crumbs freeze on the way to their mouths, and know not which is their
right hand. I should like to go farther, and give reasons to show that it
is advisable to choose those who are to hold so necessary an office in the
state, but this is not the fit place for it; some day I will expound the
matter to someone able to see to and rectify it; all I say now is, that
the additional fact of his being a sorcerer has removed the sorrow it gave
me to see these white hairs and this venerable countenance in so painful a
position on account of his being a pimp; though I know well there are no
sorceries in the world that can move or compel the will as some simple
folk fancy, for our will is free, nor is there herb or charm that can
force it. All that certain silly women and quacks do is to turn men mad
with potions and poisons, pretending that they have power to cause love,
for, as I say, it is an impossibility to compel the will.”
</p>
<p>
“It is true,” said the good old man, “and indeed, sir, as far as the
charge of sorcery goes I was not guilty; as to that of being a pimp I
cannot deny it; but I never thought I was doing any harm by it, for my
only object was that all the world should enjoy itself and live in peace
and quiet, without quarrels or troubles; but my good intentions were
unavailing to save me from going where I never expect to come back from,
with this weight of years upon me and a urinary ailment that never gives
me a moment’s ease;” and again he fell to weeping as before, and such
compassion did Sancho feel for him that he took out a real of four from
his bosom and gave it to him in alms.
</p>
<p>
Don Quixote went on and asked another what his crime was, and the man
answered with no less but rather much more sprightliness than the last
one.
</p>
<p>
“I am here because I carried the joke too far with a couple of cousins of
mine, and with a couple of other cousins who were none of mine; in short,
I carried the joke so far with them all that it ended in such a
complicated increase of kindred that no accountant could make it clear: it
was all proved against me, I got no favour, I had no money, I was near
having my neck stretched, they sentenced me to the galleys for six years,
I accepted my fate, it is the punishment of my fault; I am a young man;
let life only last, and with that all will come right. If you, sir, have
anything wherewith to help the poor, God will repay it to you in heaven,
and we on earth will take care in our petitions to him to pray for the
life and health of your worship, that they may be as long and as good as
your amiable appearance deserves.”
</p>
<p>
This one was in the dress of a student, and one of the guards said he was
a great talker and a very elegant Latin scholar.
</p>
<p>
Behind all these there came a man of thirty, a very personable fellow,
except that when he looked, his eyes turned in a little one towards the
other. He was bound differently from the rest, for he had to his leg a
chain so long that it was wound all round his body, and two rings on his
neck, one attached to the chain, the other to what they call a
“keep-friend” or “friend’s foot,” from which hung two irons reaching to
his waist with two manacles fixed to them in which his hands were secured
by a big padlock, so that he could neither raise his hands to his mouth
nor lower his head to his hands. Don Quixote asked why this man carried so
many more chains than the others. The guard replied that it was because he
alone had committed more crimes than all the rest put together, and was so
daring and such a villain, that though they marched him in that fashion
they did not feel sure of him, but were in dread of his making his escape.
</p>
<p>
“What crimes can he have committed,” said Don Quixote, “if they have not
deserved a heavier punishment than being sent to the galleys?”
</p>
<p>
“He goes for ten years,” replied the guard, “which is the same thing as
civil death, and all that need be said is that this good fellow is the
famous Gines de Pasamonte, otherwise called Ginesillo de Parapilla.”
</p>
<p>
“Gently, señor commissary,” said the galley slave at this, “let us have no
fixing of names or surnames; my name is Gines, not Ginesillo, and my
family name is Pasamonte, not Parapilla as you say; let each one mind his
own business, and he will be doing enough.”
</p>
<p>
“Speak with less impertinence, master thief of extra measure,” replied the
commissary, “if you don’t want me to make you hold your tongue in spite of
your teeth.”
</p>
<p>
“It is easy to see,” returned the galley slave, “that man goes as God
pleases, but someone shall know some day whether I am called Ginesillo de
Parapilla or not.”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t they call you so, you liar?” said the guard.
</p>
<p>
“They do,” returned Gines, “but I will make them give over calling me so,
or I will be shaved, where, I only say behind my teeth. If you, sir, have
anything to give us, give it to us at once, and God speed you, for you are
becoming tiresome with all this inquisitiveness about the lives of others;
if you want to know about mine, let me tell you I am Gines de Pasamonte,
whose life is written by these fingers.”
</p>
<p>
“He says true,” said the commissary, “for he has himself written his story
as grand as you please, and has left the book in the prison in pawn for
two hundred reals.”
</p>
<p>
“And I mean to take it out of pawn,” said Gines, “though it were in for
two hundred ducats.”
</p>
<p>
“Is it so good?” said Don Quixote.
</p>
<p>
“So good is it,” replied Gines, “that a fig for ‘Lazarillo de Tormes,’ and
all of that kind that have been written, or shall be written compared with
it: all I will say about it is that it deals with facts, and facts so neat
and diverting that no lies could match them.”
</p>
<p>
“And how is the book entitled?” asked Don Quixote.
</p>
<p>
“The ‘Life of Gines de Pasamonte,’” replied the subject of it.
</p>
<p>
“And is it finished?” asked Don Quixote.
</p>
<p>
“How can it be finished,” said the other, “when my life is not yet
finished? All that is written is from my birth down to the point when they
sent me to the galleys this last time.”
</p>
<p>
“Then you have been there before?” said Don Quixote.
</p>
<p>
“In the service of God and the king I have been there for four years
before now, and I know by this time what the biscuit and courbash are
like,” replied Gines; “and it is no great grievance to me to go back to
them, for there I shall have time to finish my book; I have still many
things left to say, and in the galleys of Spain there is more than enough
leisure; though I do not want much for what I have to write, for I have it
by heart.”
</p>
<p>
“You seem a clever fellow,” said Don Quixote.
</p>
<p>
“And an unfortunate one,” replied Gines, “for misfortune always persecutes
good wit.”
</p>
<p>
“It persecutes rogues,” said the commissary.
</p>
<p>
“I told you already to go gently, master commissary,” said
Pasamonte; “their lordships yonder never gave you that staff to ill-treat
us wretches here, but to conduct and take us where his majesty orders you; if
not, by the life of—never mind—; it may be that some day the stains
made in the inn will come out in the scouring; let everyone hold his tongue and
behave well and speak better; and now let us march on, for we have had quite
enough of this entertainment.”
</p>
<p>
The commissary lifted his staff to strike Pasamonte in return for his
threats, but Don Quixote came between them, and begged him not to ill-use
him, as it was not too much to allow one who had his hands tied to have
his tongue a trifle free; and turning to the whole chain of them he said:
</p>
<p>
“From all you have told me, dear brethren, I make out clearly that though
they have punished you for your faults, the punishments you are about to endure
do not give you much pleasure, and that you go to them very much against the
grain and against your will, and that perhaps this one’s want of courage
under torture, that one’s want of money, the other’s want of
advocacy, and lastly the perverted judgment of the judge may have been the
cause of your ruin and of your failure to obtain the justice you had on your
side. All which presents itself now to my mind, urging, persuading, and even
compelling me to demonstrate in your case the purpose for which Heaven sent me
into the world and caused me to make profession of the order of chivalry to
which I belong, and the vow I took therein to give aid to those in need and
under the oppression of the strong. But as I know that it is a mark of prudence
not to do by foul means what may be done by fair, I will ask these gentlemen,
the guards and commissary, to be so good as to release you and let you go in
peace, as there will be no lack of others to serve the king under more
favourable circumstances; for it seems to me a hard case to make slaves of
those whom God and nature have made free. Moreover, sirs of the guard,”
added Don Quixote, “these poor fellows have done nothing to you; let each
answer for his own sins yonder; there is a God in Heaven who will not forget to
punish the wicked or reward the good; and it is not fitting that honest men
should be the instruments of punishment to others, they being therein no way
concerned. This request I make thus gently and quietly, that, if you comply
with it, I may have reason for thanking you; and, if you will not voluntarily,
this lance and sword together with the might of my arm shall compel you to
comply with it by force.”
</p>
<p>
“Nice nonsense!” said the commissary; “a fine piece of pleasantry he has
come out with at last! He wants us to let the king’s prisoners go, as if
we had any authority to release them, or he to order us to do so! Go your
way, sir, and good luck to you; put that basin straight that you’ve got on
your head, and don’t go looking for three feet on a cat.”
</p>
<p>
“’Tis you that are the cat, rat, and rascal,” replied Don Quixote, and
acting on the word he fell upon him so suddenly that without giving him
time to defend himself he brought him to the ground sorely wounded with a
lance-thrust; and lucky it was for him that it was the one that had the
musket. The other guards stood thunderstruck and amazed at this unexpected
event, but recovering presence of mind, those on horseback seized their
swords, and those on foot their javelins, and attacked Don Quixote, who
was waiting for them with great calmness; and no doubt it would have gone
badly with him if the galley slaves, seeing the chance before them of
liberating themselves, had not effected it by contriving to break the
chain on which they were strung. Such was the confusion, that the guards,
now rushing at the galley slaves who were breaking loose, now to attack
Don Quixote who was waiting for them, did nothing at all that was of any
use. Sancho, on his part, gave a helping hand to release Gines de
Pasamonte, who was the first to leap forth upon the plain free and
unfettered, and who, attacking the prostrate commissary, took from him his
sword and the musket, with which, aiming at one and levelling at another,
he, without ever discharging it, drove every one of the guards off the
field, for they took to flight, as well to escape Pasamonte’s musket, as
the showers of stones the now released galley slaves were raining upon
them. Sancho was greatly grieved at the affair, because he anticipated
that those who had fled would report the matter to the Holy Brotherhood,
who at the summons of the alarm-bell would at once sally forth in quest of
the offenders; and he said so to his master, and entreated him to leave
the place at once, and go into hiding in the sierra that was close by.
</p>
<p>
“That is all very well,” said Don Quixote, “but I know what must be done
now;” and calling together all the galley slaves, who were now running
riot, and had stripped the commissary to the skin, he collected them round
him to hear what he had to say, and addressed them as follows: “To be
grateful for benefits received is the part of persons of good birth, and
one of the sins most offensive to God is ingratitude; I say so because,
sirs, ye have already seen by manifest proof the benefit ye have received
of me; in return for which I desire, and it is my good pleasure that,
laden with that chain which I have taken off your necks, ye at once set
out and proceed to the city of El Toboso, and there present yourselves
before the lady Dulcinea del Toboso, and say to her that her knight, he of
the Rueful Countenance, sends to commend himself to her; and that ye
recount to her in full detail all the particulars of this notable
adventure, up to the recovery of your longed-for liberty; and this done ye
may go where ye will, and good fortune attend you.”
</p>
<p>
Gines de Pasamonte made answer for all, saying, “That which you, sir, our
deliverer, demand of us, is of all impossibilities the most impossible to
comply with, because we cannot go together along the roads, but only
singly and separate, and each one his own way, endeavouring to hide
ourselves in the bowels of the earth to escape the Holy Brotherhood,
which, no doubt, will come out in search of us. What your worship may do,
and fairly do, is to change this service and tribute as regards the lady
Dulcinea del Toboso for a certain quantity of ave-marias and credos which
we will say for your worship’s intention, and this is a condition that can
be complied with by night as by day, running or resting, in peace or in
war; but to imagine that we are going now to return to the flesh-pots of
Egypt, I mean to take up our chain and set out for El Toboso, is to
imagine that it is now night, though it is not yet ten in the morning, and
to ask this of us is like asking pears of the elm tree.”
</p>
<p>
“Then by all that’s good,” said Don Quixote (now stirred to wrath), “Don
son of a bitch, Don Ginesillo de Paropillo, or whatever your name is, you
will have to go yourself alone, with your tail between your legs and the
whole chain on your back.”
</p>
<p>
Pasamonte, who was anything but meek (being by this time thoroughly
convinced that Don Quixote was not quite right in his head as he had
committed such a vagary as to set them free), finding himself abused in
this fashion, gave the wink to his companions, and falling back they began
to shower stones on Don Quixote at such a rate that he was quite unable to
protect himself with his buckler, and poor Rocinante no more heeded the
spur than if he had been made of brass. Sancho planted himself behind his
ass, and with him sheltered himself from the hailstorm that poured on both
of them. Don Quixote was unable to shield himself so well but that more
pebbles than I could count struck him full on the body with such force
that they brought him to the ground; and the instant he fell the student
pounced upon him, snatched the basin from his head, and with it struck
three or four blows on his shoulders, and as many more on the ground,
knocking it almost to pieces. They then stripped him of a jacket that he
wore over his armour, and they would have stripped off his stockings if
his greaves had not prevented them. From Sancho they took his coat,
leaving him in his shirt-sleeves; and dividing among themselves the
remaining spoils of the battle, they went each one his own way, more
solicitous about keeping clear of the Holy Brotherhood they dreaded, than
about burdening themselves with the chain, or going to present themselves
before the lady Dulcinea del Toboso. The ass and Rocinante, Sancho and Don
Quixote, were all that were left upon the spot; the ass with drooping
head, serious, shaking his ears from time to time as if he thought the
storm of stones that assailed them was not yet over; Rocinante stretched
beside his master, for he too had been brought to the ground by a stone;
Sancho stripped, and trembling with fear of the Holy Brotherhood; and Don
Quixote fuming to find himself so served by the very persons for whom he
had done so much.

Seeing himself served in this way, Don Quixote said to his squire, “I have
always heard it said, Sancho, that to do good to boors is to throw water
into the sea. If I had believed thy words, I should have avoided this
trouble; but it is done now, it is only to have patience and take warning
for the future.”

“Your worship will take warning as much as I am a Turk,” returned Sancho;
“but, as you say this mischief might have been avoided if you had believed
me, believe me now, and a still greater one will be avoided; for I tell
you chivalry is of no account with the Holy Brotherhood, and they don’t
care two maravedis for all the knights-errant in the world; and I can tell
you I fancy I hear their arrows whistling past my ears this minute.”
</p>
<p>
“Thou art a coward by nature, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “but lest thou
shouldst say I am obstinate, and that I never do as thou dost advise, this
once I will take thy advice, and withdraw out of reach of that fury thou
so dreadest; but it must be on one condition, that never, in life or in
death, thou art to say to anyone that I retired or withdrew from this
danger out of fear, but only in compliance with thy entreaties; for if
thou sayest otherwise thou wilt lie therein, and from this time to that,
and from that to this, I give thee lie, and say thou liest and wilt lie
every time thou thinkest or sayest it; and answer me not again; for at the
mere thought that I am withdrawing or retiring from any danger, above all
from this, which does seem to carry some little shadow of fear with it, I
am ready to take my stand here and await alone, not only that Holy
Brotherhood you talk of and dread, but the brothers of the twelve tribes
of Israel, and the Seven Maccabees, and Castor and Pollux, and all the
brothers and brotherhoods in the world.”
</p>
<p>
“Señor,” replied Sancho, “to retire is not to flee, and there is no wisdom
in waiting when danger outweighs hope, and it is the part of wise men to
preserve themselves to-day for to-morrow, and not risk all in one day; and
let me tell you, though I am a clown and a boor, I have got some notion of
what they call safe conduct; so repent not of having taken my advice, but
mount Rocinante if you can, and if not I will help you; and follow me, for
my mother-wit tells me we have more need of legs than hands just now.”
</p>
<p>
Don Quixote mounted without replying, and, Sancho leading the way on his
ass, they entered the side of the Sierra Morena, which was close by, as it
was Sancho’s design to cross it entirely and come out again at El Viso or
Almodóvar del Campo, and hide for some days among its crags so as to
escape the search of the Brotherhood should they come to look for them. He
was encouraged in this by perceiving that the stock of provisions carried
by the ass had come safe out of the fray with the galley slaves, a
circumstance that he regarded as a miracle, seeing how they pillaged and
ransacked.

That night they reached the very heart of the Sierra Morena, where it
seemed prudent to Sancho to pass the night and even some days, at least as
many as the stores he carried might last, and so they encamped between two
rocks and among some cork trees; but fatal destiny, which, according to
the opinion of those who have not the light of the true faith, directs,
arranges, and settles everything in its own way, so ordered it that Gines
de Pasamonte, the famous knave and thief who by the virtue and madness of
Don Quixote had been released from the chain, driven by fear of the Holy
Brotherhood, which he had good reason to dread, resolved to take hiding in
the mountains; and his fate and fear led him to the same spot to which Don
Quixote and Sancho Panza had been led by theirs, just in time to recognise
damsel of great discretion. The tables being removed, suddenly through the door
them and leave them to fall asleep: and as the wicked are always
ungrateful, and necessity leads to evildoing, and immediate advantage
overcomes all considerations of the future, Gines, who was neither
grateful nor well-principled, made up his mind to steal Sancho Panza’s
ass, not troubling himself about Rocinante, as being a prize that was no
good either to pledge or sell. While Sancho slept he stole his ass, and
before day dawned he was far out of reach.

Aurora made her appearance bringing gladness to the earth but sadness to
Sancho Panza, for he found that his Dapple was missing, and seeing himself
bereft of him he began the saddest and most doleful lament in the world,
so loud that Don Quixote awoke at his exclamations and heard him saying,
“O son of my bowels, born in my very house, my children’s plaything, my
wife’s joy, the envy of my neighbours, relief of my burdens, and lastly,
half supporter of myself, for with the six-and-twenty maravedis thou didst
earn me daily I met half my charges.”
</p>
<p>
Don Quixote, when he heard the lament and learned the cause, consoled
Sancho with the best arguments he could, entreating him to be patient, and
promising to give him a letter of exchange ordering three out of five
ass-colts that he had at home to be given to him. Sancho took comfort at
this, dried his tears, suppressed his sobs, and returned thanks for the
kindness shown him by Don Quixote. He on his part was rejoiced to the
heart on entering the mountains, as they seemed to him to be just the
place for the adventures he was in quest of. They brought back to his
memory the marvellous adventures that had befallen knights-errant in like
solitudes and wilds, and he went along reflecting on these things, so
absorbed and carried away by them that he had no thought for anything
else.
</p>
<p>
<br><br><br><br> <a id="c23e"></a>
</p>
<div class="fig" style="width:60%;">

<p>
Nor had Sancho any other care (now that he fancied he was travelling in a
safe quarter) than to satisfy his appetite with such remains as were left
of the clerical spoils, and so he marched behind his master laden with
what Dapple used to carry, emptying the sack and packing his paunch, and
so long as he could go that way, he would not have given a farthing to
meet with another adventure.
</p>
<p>
While so engaged he raised his eyes and saw that his master had halted,
and was trying with the point of his pike to lift some bulky object that
lay upon the ground, on which he hastened to join him and help him if it
were needful, and reached him just as with the point of the pike he was
raising a saddle-pad with a valise attached to it, half or rather wholly
rotten and torn; but so heavy were they that Sancho had to help to take
them up, and his master directed him to see what the valise contained.
Sancho did so with great alacrity, and though the valise was secured by a
chain and padlock, from its torn and rotten condition he was able to see
its contents, which were four shirts of fine holland, and other articles
of linen no less curious than clean; and in a handkerchief he found a good
lot of gold crowns, and as soon as he saw them he exclaimed:
</p>
<p>
“Blessed be all Heaven for sending us an adventure that is good for
something!”
</p>
<p>
Searching further he found a little memorandum book richly bound; this Don
Quixote asked of him, telling him to take the money and keep it for
himself. Sancho kissed his hands for the favour, and cleared the valise of
its linen, which he stowed away in the provision sack. Considering the
whole matter, Don Quixote observed:
</p>
<p>
“It seems to me, Sancho—and it is impossible it can be otherwise—that
some strayed traveller must have crossed this sierra and been attacked and
slain by footpads, who brought him to this remote spot to bury him.”
</p>
<p>
“That cannot be,” answered Sancho, “because if they had been robbers they
would not have left this money.”
</p>
<p>
“Thou art right,” said Don Quixote, “and I cannot guess or explain what
this may mean; but stay; let us see if in this memorandum book there is
anything written by which we may be able to trace out or discover what we
want to know.”
</p>
<p>
He opened it, and the first thing he found in it, written roughly but in a
very good hand, was a sonnet, and reading it aloud that Sancho might hear
it, he found that it ran as follows:
</p>
<p class="poem">
SONNET<br>
<br>
Or Love is lacking in intelligence,<br>
Or to the height of cruelty attains,<br>
Or else it is my doom to suffer pains<br>
Beyond the measure due to my offence.<br>
But if Love be a God, it follows thence<br>
That he knows all, and certain it remains<br>
No God loves cruelty; then who ordains<br>
This penance that enthrals while it torments?<br>
It were a falsehood, Chloe, thee to name;<br>
Such evil with such goodness cannot live;<br>
And against Heaven I dare not charge the blame,<br>
I only know it is my fate to die.<br>
To him who knows not whence his malady<br>
A miracle alone a cure can give.<br>

<p>
“There is nothing to be learned from that rhyme,” said Sancho, “unless by
that clue there’s in it, one may draw out the ball of the whole matter.”
</p>
<p>
“What clue is there?” said Don Quixote.
</p>
<p>
“I thought your worship spoke of a clue in it,” said Sancho.
</p>
<p>
“I only said Chloe,” replied Don Quixote; “and that no doubt, is the name
of the lady of whom the author of the sonnet complains; and, faith, he
must be a tolerable poet, or I know little of the craft.”
</p>
<p>
“Then your worship understands rhyming too?”
</p>
<p>
“And better than thou thinkest,” replied Don Quixote, “as thou shalt see
when thou carriest a letter written in verse from beginning to end to my
lady Dulcinea del Toboso, for I would have thee know, Sancho, that all or
most of the knights-errant in days of yore were great troubadours and
great musicians, for both of these accomplishments, or more properly
speaking gifts, are the peculiar property of lovers-errant: true it is
that the verses of the knights of old have more spirit than neatness in
them.”
</p>
<p>
“Read more, your worship,” said Sancho, “and you will find something that
will enlighten us.”
</p>
<p>
Don Quixote turned the page and said, “This is prose and seems to be a
letter.”
</p>
<p>
“A correspondence letter, señor?”
</p>
<p>
“From the beginning it seems to be a love letter,” replied Don Quixote.
</p>
<p>
“Then let your worship read it aloud,” said Sancho, “for I am very fond of
love matters.”
</p>
<p>
“With all my heart,” said Don Quixote, and reading it aloud as Sancho had
requested him, he found it ran thus:
</p>
<p class="letter">
Thy false promise and my sure misfortune carry me to a place whence the
news of my death will reach thy ears before the words of my complaint.
Ungrateful one, thou hast rejected me for one more wealthy, but not more
worthy; but if virtue were esteemed wealth I should neither envy the
fortunes of others nor weep for misfortunes of my own. What thy beauty
raised up thy deeds have laid low; by it I believed thee to be an angel,
by them I know thou art a woman. Peace be with thee who hast sent war to
me, and Heaven grant that the deceit of thy husband be ever hidden from
thee, so that thou repent not of what thou hast done, and I reap not a
revenge I would not have.
</p>
<p>
When he had finished the letter, Don Quixote said, “There is less to be
gathered from this than from the verses, except that he who wrote it is
some rejected lover;” and turning over nearly all the pages of the book he
found more verses and letters, some of which he could read, while others
he could not; but they were all made up of complaints, laments,
misgivings, desires and aversions, favours and rejections, some rapturous,
some doleful. While Don Quixote examined the book, Sancho examined the
valise, not leaving a corner in the whole of it or in the pad that he did
not search, peer into, and explore, or seam that he did not rip, or tuft
of wool that he did not pick to pieces, lest anything should escape for
want of care and pains; so keen was the covetousness excited in him by the
discovery of the crowns, which amounted to near a hundred; and though he
found no more booty, he held the blanket flights, balsam vomits, stake
benedictions, carriers’ fisticuffs, missing alforjas, stolen coat, and all
the hunger, thirst, and weariness he had endured in the service of his
good master, cheap at the price; as he considered himself more than fully
indemnified for all by the payment he received in the gift of the
treasure-trove.
</p>
<p>
The Knight of the Rueful Countenance was still very anxious to find out
who the owner of the valise could be, conjecturing from the sonnet and
letter, from the money in gold, and from the fineness of the shirts, that
he must be some lover of distinction whom the scorn and cruelty of his
lady had driven to some desperate course; but as in that uninhabited and
rugged spot there was no one to be seen of whom he could inquire, he saw
nothing else for it but to push on, taking whatever road Rocinante chose—which
was where he could make his way—firmly persuaded that among these
wilds he could not fail to meet some rare adventure. As he went along,
then, occupied with these thoughts, he perceived on the summit of a height
that rose before their eyes a man who went springing from rock to rock and
from tussock to tussock with marvellous agility. As well as he could make
out he was unclad, with a thick black beard, long tangled hair, and bare
legs and feet, his thighs were covered by breeches apparently of tawny
velvet but so ragged that they showed his skin in several places.

He was bareheaded, and notwithstanding the swiftness with which he passed
as has been described, the Knight of the Rueful Countenance observed and
noted all these trifles, and though he made the attempt, he was unable to
follow him, for it was not granted to the feebleness of Rocinante to make
way over such rough ground, he being, moreover, slow-paced and sluggish by
nature. Don Quixote at once came to the conclusion that this was the owner
of the saddle-pad and of the valise, and made up his mind to go in search
of him, even though he should have to wander a year in those mountains
before he found him, and so he directed Sancho to take a short cut over
one side of the mountain, while he himself went by the other, and perhaps
by this means they might light upon this man who had passed so quickly out
of their sight.
</p>
<p>
“I could not do that,” said Sancho, “for when I separate from your worship
fear at once lays hold of me, and assails me with all sorts of panics and
fancies; and let what I now say be a notice that from this time forth I am
not going to stir a finger’s width from your presence.”
</p>
<p>
“It shall be so,” said he of the Rueful Countenance, “and I am very glad
that thou art willing to rely on my courage, which will never fail thee,
