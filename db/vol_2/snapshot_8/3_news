In "vector.h 1.3" the following definition of the X(X&) constructor
is given:

vector(type).vector(type)(vector(type)& a)
{
	register i = a.sz;
	sz = a.sz; 			/* ADD THIS LINE */
	v = new type[i];
	register type* vv = &v[i];
	register type* av = &a.v[i];
	while (i--) *--vv = *--av;
}

You should add the indicated line in order to set the size of
the new vector. If that is not done you get "vector index out of
range" errors.

I found two other errors in this header file, I posted
earlier. If you are interested in them just send a reply (r).

I suppose the exclusive intermarriage among Jews must also have

Does anyone have any data on that?

There was a show on sometime between the late 70's and early 80's (1 season).
And I can't remember the name.  It was actually two (or more) shows in one
with each sub-show taking a fraction of the time slot.  One part was a 
modern day dracula.  Another dealt with a society living underground.  They
couldn't come up to the surface without special filters due to dust/pollution
or some such.  Ring any bells?  It was NBC, I think.

The answer to both questions is yes.  The Free Software Foundation (you
know, the GNU Emacs people) will distribute (soon?) a modified version of
their C compiler which does C++.  Their debugger GDB (a dbx-lookalike) knows
how to handle it.

I haven't used either of these so I have no opinions to whether they are

I have only the faintest interest in the ST stuff and I would prefer it
to be posted elsewhere, although I am not particularly bothered either.

I think the interesting question is: WHY DO WE HAVE DIFFERENT NEWSGROUPS??

I always thought it was to organize postings by subject and because different
people are interested in different things.

If you argue that ST postings could as well be made to rec.arts.sf-lovers
rather than to the special ST newsgroup, you could just as well argue
that we only need one newsgroup on the entire net: general.general.general.

NCSA Telnet is really a must, but ...
on a Mac SE and a Mac II, NCSA Telnet 2.0 forces an american keyboard, in a
permanent manner (it remains after exiting telnet, until the next Macintosh
reboot). It is very painful when you use, for instance, a french keyboard:
not only you have to remember to type Q for A, and so on, but you cannot
type for example a Control-Z under telnet.
[On a Macintosh +, one do not loss its keyboard]

Is this bug fixed in the last version ?

This is simply NOT TRUE. I am also working with MSC (version 4.0) and had only
one minor problem when I compiled MicroEmacs 3.9e (the latest version which
was posted on Usenet). This problem relates to the Subshell spawning. But if
you know just a little bit of C, there is no problem to fix it (add a routine
specific to MSC). Some time ago, there was even a posting in comp.sources.bugs
describing all the necessary steps to do that.

I am sure you enable breaking with ^C (either in config.sys or in autoexec.bat)
Turn this off, and all your problems have gone :-)
I know this is not the solution to this problem we all want to have. Perhaps
you can do it with signal(). If not you have to included a function of your own
which intercepts the break vector of MS-DOS.

(Character) file storage is simply more flexible.  The form in which
information is stored must be the most flexible possible, or you lose
information.  The D-crate's pitching of conditionals is simply the
manifestation of this.

Proponents of restrictive protocols for information storage really ask
"the world" to change to fit the protocol model.  In science, models
change to fit the data, not the other way round (unless you cheat).
To me, browbeating eventual non-conformists into "catching up" by
labeling the a model as "advanced" is just a form of negative
motivation.  All the lousy places I have ever worked ran on negative
motivation, none of the good ones.  If your model *is* really worth
using, and you can communicate its value, you will not need such
tactics. 

Interactively defined functions?  Haven't typed one in *years* -
that's what scratch buffers are for (in case I want to change a
*character* or two, or later save it.).

Any mouse-based gadgets you can point to in Interlisp can be recreated
for a text editor working on correctly parsed Lisp code.  May  take
execution time, but if this is prohibitive, your function is probably
too large.

     Those interested in the issues surrounding the mechanics and
philosophy of fantasy worlds should read Tolkien's (non-fiction)
essay "On Fairy-Stories".  It appears in the collections _Tree and
Leaf_ and _The Tolkien Reader_.

     One of the main ideas behind it is that the fantasy author or
story-teller is a "sub-creator", who tries to create a "secondary
belief" (rather than exactly a "willing suspension of disbelief")
in the reader.  In the fantasy that works, the reader should be
able to enter the world every time she picks up the book, and not
be aware of the world as being constructed by the author.  This
involves not only internal consistency, but a lack of gimmickry.

     For instance, in _Lord of the Rings_ I was never aware of
anything being in the world gratuitously.  (Others may differ! :-))
In _The Sword of Sha-Na-Na_ (sic)(sick?), on the other hand, I was
very aware of the Elfstones as being just a gimmick to get the
characters out of tight spots.  Sure it was internally consistent
(the Elfstones only had any effect in times of direst need for
their holders), but the hand of the author was clearly visible.

     Similarly, applying it to FRPG's, the magic system in AD&D is
certainly internally consistent (to the extent that it is described),
but just doesn't "work" for me.  Having MU's able to remember several
copies of a spell, but forgetting it when the last copy is cast, is
obviously a gimmick to limit the number of spells an MU can use.

     So I guess the moral of all this for FRPG or module designers
is that it's best to start out with a few basic assumptions and build
up your world from them by fairly believable steps, and if you can't
avoid ending up with something really hairy, then change one of your
assumptions rather than put in quick kludges.  (Gee, sounds like
software engineering! :=))

1)  Does anyone, preferably in the UK or Europe, have a copy of the new
X toolkit interface definition I can get by ftp?

2)  I'm considering implementing the X toolkit in Standard ML.  Are there any
constraints on what I should include or exclude?  The documentation mentions
implementation in different languages, but doesn't say much about what this
means.  Is the idea to provide the same functions, with the same names and
functionality, in each language?  What about languages that have automatic
storage management or automatic creation of objects, etc?  How far can I
deviate from the documentation & still use the name "X Toolkit"?

3)  Is the toolkit definition limited to the intrinsics, or are toolkits
expected to provide a standard class hierarchy?

4)  Is there any relation between the InterViews toolkit, the Xr, Sx &
DEC toolkits provided with X version 10R4, and the current X toolkit?

5)  If I go ahead, my first implementation will be a prototype, on top of X
version 10R4.  This is because someone else is working on porting X version 11
to Standard ML, and I want a simple windowing system I can use fairly quickly.
I hope the prototype will make implementing a full version reasonably
straightforward.  I will probably ignore the resource manager, since I'll get
that for free when the full Xlib is implemented.  I'll also ignore colour for
the time being, and only implement devices (widgets) I'm immediately interested
in.  Is there anything else I can obviously ignore?

Some (possibly) timely information from a course entitled "The Art of
Communication for Engineers" that I'm on this week.

From one of the handouts :-

"Word processors: research has shown that when writers use pen and paper
 alone, their thoughts and information tend to have better planning and
 organisation. When using word processors alone, writers tend to plan
 on a more surface level, focussing on such aspects as word choice, sentence
 structure, and spelling"

It goes on to recommend starting with pen and paper and graduating to WP's
after the first draft has been written.

I trust that this may have been of some interest.

As an aside, Roy has a new album out early next year, probably January.

tege@nada.kth.se replied by e-mail to my original posting which asked
if it is always possible to append digits to a positive number in order
to make a prime. Unfortunately, his address is one of those I can't
reach, and so I thought I'd kill two birds with one stone and post
another article.
  His argument is very simple, using the Prime Number Theorem to give
an approximation to the number of primes between x.10^n and
x.10^n+10^n-1 (which is the same problem I asked but translated to
mathematics) which shows that as n -> inf, this number of primes also
goes to infinity. A very simple argument that proves you can always
append digits to make any number into a prime. Great stuff.

I use Home Accountant Plus by Continental Software. The (legit.) version I use
was originally bundled with the Columbia MPC, so it had to be 'unprotected'
and altered to remove some hardware dependencies. (Incidentally, this made
it possible to compile it with QuickBasic - essential if you're impatient
like me!)

I've found it reasonably secure and well-featured.

I have a friend who is trying to transfer some files off of an Micromation
MP/M system.

He has so far moved the standard "Generic" CP/M Kermit (slowly) to the MP/M
machine but it doesn't seem to work correctly.

Has anybody ever managed to get Kermit to work under M/PM?  Is there a simple
set of differences between C/PM kermit and M/PM Kermit.  We have the full
source code for C/PM Kermit.

The HP840 is a RISC architecture machine.  Reduced instruction set implies
more instructions required to do the same job than on a 'complex'
instruction set machine, hence the proportionately larger executable files.
Presumably your 4.3BSD machine is a VAX-alike (i.e. complex instruction set).

The only other file from your list which exists on our HP840 system is
the C compiler, and look at the size of that beast!!

This should perhaps belong in comp.arch

It would appear that most 8088,8086,186 and 286 systems are
limited by the number of cycles taken to execute instructions
(I.E the clock speed).  However the 80386 (at 16 and esp at 20 Mhz)
is limited by its memory bus bandwidth.  That is the memory subsystem
on most 286 boxes is fast enough have little or no real effect on
performance compared to a change in clock speed.   An 80386
however is largly limited by the rate that it can be 'fed' data
and instructions.   

16 Bit memory subsystems have a devestating effect on the 80386 
for 2 reasons.  Firstly 2 memory accesses are required rather than
one thus doubling the access time.  Secondly most 16 bit memory cards
are designed for 8 or 10 Mhz operation not 16 Mhz so a significant
number of wait states are needed when used with a 386.   It would
appear that a 'cache miss' on the Intel Inboard(tm) generates beteween
10 and 12 wait states thus making access to 16 bit ram slower than
from the original 286.

In conclustion - if you want a 32 bit CPU use 32 bit ram.  If you
just want the instruction set use the P9 (80388) - if it ever appears.

(This posting written on a Dell 386 with 6 MB of 0 wait static 32 bit ram)

I didn't know of the CTRL-SHIFT-ALT trick, but I had a problem similar
to yours: there was no way my Mega would boot from floppy, and that
turned out to be quite a problem when a desk accessory I had downloded
from somewhere was turned unusable because of line noise.  My "solution"
was not to boot from hard disk at all, which I now find better since it
allows me to choose different configurations (desk accesories and such)
depending on the job I'm going to do.

I'm also interested on this question, and it has been already asked a couple
of times with no visible answer.  I've never used the old ROMs, so I don't
know what the infamous "40 folder limit" means. I've had more than 40 folders
on my hard disk and nothing happened.  Does this mean that the problem is
fixed? Or is it 40 folders DEEP?

I've been re-reading recently Feynman's excellent volumes and enjoying
myself.  The question is:  Are there physics books of similar style?
One thing that I like about Feynman is that he tries to ``demystify''
stuff instead of giving cookbook formulas.  Since I do this as a
leisurely activity, the absence of too many formulas and long
mathematical analyses (at least in Vol. I) are also appreciated.
I'm especially interested in classical mechanics.  Philosophical
implications of physics laws such as causality, etc. are also interesting.

Send me individual replies and I'll post a summary to the net. Thanks!

The story I've heard is that this is not a bug.  Rather (as warned in the
manual) the other characters you meet are also poking around, and can have
effects even while they are not in the same location as you.

In particular, as I've heard it, if the adventurer gets to the pedestal before
you do then he will take the key.  (And allegedly you then can recover it when
you kill him.)  I haven't tried this line of play yet, so can't vouch for it,
but it sounds plausible.

There's a cute bug in the ST version, though, to do with the pedestal.  If
you move the pedestal and then type 'take all' you end up carrying the pedestal,
a duplicate of which remains in place.  (If you just try to 'take pedestal',
you are told that it is too heavy to lift.)  I'm told that this results from
a bug in the relevant object definition table entry, so it might have propagated
to other versions.  (I'd doubt that the driving data undergoes as much analysis
as the executable code during porting to other machines.)

Hi,
   I have a problem with the Zorland C compiler, aka Datalight-C or
NorthWest-C which I wondered if any netlander had previously encountered
and solved.
   I have a program which works fine in small model but recently I had
to go to the data model (small code, large data) whereupon it hung my
XT clone. Tracing execution seems to indicate that the DOS software
interrupt routine INT86 may be the source of the trouble.
   Has anyone seen problems with INT86 in D or L model programs? The
prospect of DEBUGging the interface between C and assembler does not
appeal to me.
   BTW I have deliberately not given details of the program. I do not
       want to debug it on the net. Please e-mail me only if you have
       solid evidence of problems in the INT86 area.

      thanks for any help you can give,
           Andrew

If anyone knows of any routines which might be helpful (or any hints about
how to go about it), I'd be very grateful to hear about them.

Please reply to me directly by mail, as I don't (yet) get this newsgroup
directly.

Thanks in advance,

The best set which I've found are the Wargames Research Group 1685 - 1850
rules. Although the time period sounds a bit long these rules have the
following advantages (My opinions only).

- Wide ranges of troops covered (You can fight outside Europe)
- Wide range of weapons covered (Pikes for those Moscow Militiamen etc)
- Simple solution for combat - This is what I really like, There@s
      No nonsense evaluating every 20th of a casualty, or evaluating
      grenadier companies firing separate from the rest of their battallion.
- All weapons are handled simply. Just a different entry in one table.
- Movement is alternate, not simultaneous, things move much quicker.
- Hand to hand combat is decided very quickly, (Just like reality).
- Morale tests are also quite fast to do, and give specific tests for
  different situations. (This avoids an old problem where eg Horsemen test
      morale before charging, Test fails horribly, Horsemen rout off the 
      field.) To make you go away, the opponent actually has to do
      something.
- European regulars have "National characteristics".
    ie British are disciplined infantry and rash cavalry.
       Russians are stoical Infantry (Won@t retreat easily)
       Spanish are easily panicked
       Highlanders charge aggressively
       French columns are impetuous and frighten the enemy.
       Austrian and Prussian cavalry are Bold
       Austrian, Spanish and Dutch Generals are Cautious.

Together with these rules I would recommend the army lists published by
Table Top Games.

These cover the European armies for most of the big campaigns of
1805-1815 and ensure a balanced army is selected (Although the 
1000 point armies don@t always work too well.
eg My russians need 12 Gun Artillery Batteries (6 pieces on the table)
   This leaves me few points for infantry or cavalry
   (In practice a Russian 1000 point army has two of Inf, Cav & Art)

The lists also help to enhance the National Flavour of an army
ie British get few Cavalry, but some veteran Infantry.
   French after 1812 have Raw Infantry or Guards.
   Austrians Have Very Large numbers Of infantry.

I can summarise some of the +/- points of each of the armies I've seen
if you mail me.

I'd recommend 15mm scale troops (Much cheaper and more transportable)
    They'll fit on your table too.

I actually use the 6mm scale which is cheaper, lighter and requires
about 60cm x 100 cm for a medium game.
However the Job of painting, mounting and moving the little guys is
much harder.

It was 1978.  Episode 1 of the first series was a pilot production for the
whole thing and as such is slightly different in flavour to the others.  The 
first series (6 episodes) covered the ground of the TV version and books 1
and 2.  Then came the Christmas (1978) show to make a link to the second
series which was broadcast in 1979 and consisted of 5 episodes.

> For my money, the show (and scripts) are MUCH funnier than the books.

True.  The radio shows left much more to the imagination with the assistance
of some very good sound effects.  I thought the TV series spoiled it.  For 
instance at the end of the first radio series you hear the song 'What a
Wonderful World' amid the sound of burning trees on prehistoric Earth; can't
you just imagine it?

There is a scanf in libsrc.a, but it is not included in libc.a.  You have to
compile it yourself with cc -LIB -c scanf.c and put in in the library.
It was omitted from libc.a because there was no room on that diskette!

Lines: 22

Although X as distributed uses TCP/IP to connect clients and server, it
is possible use other network protocols by relatively small changes to
the lowest levels of library and server.  We have almost gotten the
server half of such a set-up running using Amoeba (a distributed
operating system with its own, capability-based RPC mechanism).
The library half should be working as soon as we solve problems with the
C compiler.

The question is, how much does this buy us?  Since Amoeba is not Unix, X
clients requiring advanced Unix features won't run under vanilla Amoeba.
What percentage of the available client applications will be convertable
to a different operating system, where, e.g., one will have <stdio.h>
available, but not select(2)?  I would assume that there will be VMS
support for X, so that one might expect clients to be OS-independent,
but then again, you can never know what hacks a performance-driven
application programmer may use... (including VAX assembly :-)

Can anybody comment on this?  It would also be interesting to know if
third-party software for X would come binary or source.

The five books are quite different in character. The second one
("The marriages between zones 3, 4 and 5") could possibly be called
"feminist SF" - it is very different from the other four in most ways.
The third ("The Sirian Experiments") is at times rather funny, and the
fifth ("The sentimental agents in the Volyen empire") is among the funniest
books I've read.

On the other hand, number 4 ("The making of the representative of planet 8")
was rather depressing. While reading it I thought that "it can't get any
worse than this". It could, of course. (I don't refer to the quality of the
book, but to the events in the story).

I should mention the title of the first one also: "Shikasta" This is
the most "important" of the five, in some sense. It is also the one that
could perhaps be called "stiff". All the books are well worth reading.

Earlier this year there has been trouble with tech-notes, that would 
not binhex correctly (the Mac program).
Then the problem could be solved with a similiar program on unix-machines.
The problem seemed to show up when the file-names where extremely long
(28 might be the number).

It seemed not to be so sensitive about file-names.

Unfortunately I have lost the sources.

The first part 'Icon menu.st' adds knowledge about icons to the 
StandardSystemController's blueButtonMenu.
You should file in this one first.
The second part 'Icon Editor.st' is the editor himself.

Some notes about icons:
The icon's textRectangle is clipped with the icon's boundingBox.
To cancel a given textRectangle simply move it outside the outlined box.
The method storeOn: in class OpaqueForm is buggy.
You should add enclosing round brackets to the output. Otherwise
you won't be able to read the saved icon definitions back.

Some TNC-2's have problems with the WA8DED software (version 2.1).
Most of the outgoing frames cannot be docoded by other stations because
the software turns off the transmitter before all bits have been transmitted.

There are two solutions to this problem:

Hardware: connect a small (~2.2uf) capacitor from the base of the PTT keying
          transistor to ground. (Note: you may have to increase TXDELAY)

Software: the code that turns off the transmitter starts at location $037B
          (3E 05...). It's possible to insert a short delay loop, so that the
          transmitter remains keyed for a few milliseconds longer.
          (I haven't tried this yet.)

PS: Does anyone know if WA8DED is on USENET/Bitnet/ARPANET/anynet???

I am using Venix for several years now and have the folowing comments.

1. it IS System V UNIX.

2. It has a faster 'feel' for the interactive user than Xenix or Microport

3. It seems to be bug free. This system is running news and I am doing most
   of the development on it. I have had no problems for at least a year now,
   and the system is on the air 24 hours a day.

   A few times I had to remove the -O options when compiling, but same
   counts for 3B2 UNIX.

4. Venturecom claims it to be REAL TIME. I have no experience with
   REAL real-time on this system, and don't know if the venix system calls
   are interruptable.

We found the following bug in sushperm.c of the sush distribution:

In routine addgroup the pointer gpmem was incremented before it was used.
So, the first member of the group was never found, and the reference to
the last member lead to an illegal memory reference (NULL pointer!).

original code:

	 gpmem = gpt->gr_mem;
	 while(*gpmem++) {  <------------------gpmem is incremented
		 if(!strcmp(user,*gpmem))  <---gpmem is used
			 ok++;
	 }

	 /* auth failed - return */

corrected code:

	 gpmem = gpt->gr_mem;
	 while(*gpmem) {
		 if(!strcmp(user,*gpmem++))
			 ok++;
	 }

	 /* auth failed - return */

Froese's best guitar solo, by most accounts, is on Cloudburst Flight
on the Force Majeure album, back in '79. He starts with slow chords
and fingering on a 12 string acoustic, then some "power chords" (!) on
the 12 string, and then onto the electric (Fender Strat I think).
Some of the recent live work's been good, as well - Franke holding down
a rhythm, with Froese and Haslinger both firing off screaming guitar riffs.

Its a looooong time since I played Zork, but I believe that you can get
to the INSIDE of the grate in the woods by which time you should have
obtained a key which will open it. This gives you an alternative entrance/
exit to the dungeon, but is not actually much help.

I am sending this letter out to the network to ask for solutions to a
particular problem of Bayesian Inference. Below is the text of the
problem, and at the end is the mathematical statement of the information
given. Simply, I am asking the questions:

1) Can you find bounds on the final result. If so, how?
2) If not, why is it not possible to do so? 
   What is missing in the specification of the problem?
3) If you get nowhere with this problem, would you be able to solve it
   if you were given the information: p(pv|t or l)=0.9?

I am interested in the problem of providing probability bounds for events
specified in a Bayesian setting when not all the necessary conditional 
probabilities are provided in setting up the problem. 

PROBLEM
~~~~~~~
(A problem relevant to the handling of Uncertainty in Expert Systems.)
We want to know the probability of a patient having both lung cancer and
tuberculosis based on the fact that this person has had a positive reading
in a chest X-ray. We are given the following pieces of information:

1. The probability that a person with lung cancer will have a positive
   chest X-ray is 0.9.

2. The probability that a person with tuberculosis will have a positive
   chest X-ray is 0.95.

3. The probability that a person with neither lung cancer nor tuberculosis
   will have a positive chest X-ray is 0.07.

4. In the town of interest, 4 percent of the population have lung cancer,
   and three percent have tuberculosis.

EVENTS
~~~~~~
l = lung cancer;       t = tuberculosis;           pv = positive chest X-ray

SETUP
~~~~~
In the statement of the problem below:-

~l means 'not l'.
~l, ~t means 'not l and not t'.
t or l means 't or l'
where 'not', 'and' , and 'or' are logical operators.
so that: p(~l, ~t) means probability( not l and not t).
Also,
p(pv|l) means the conditional probability of event pv, given event l.
PRIORS
~~~~~~
p(l) = 0.04;           p(t) = 0.03;                p(~l, ~t) = 0.95
CONDITIONALS
~~~~~~~~~~~~
p(pv|l) = 0.9;         p(pv|t) = 0.95;             p(pv| ~t,~l) = 0.07

(You are not given p(pv| t or l) )
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Please mail all solutions or comments to me, and I will let interested parties 
know what the results are. 
(I will specially treasure attempts which don't use independence assumptions.)
Thanks in advance to anyone who will spend time on this problem...
Regards,
Tom Kane.

I assume you refer to the British Empire - prior to that, Britain (and before
the rest joined/were conquered by it, England) fought mostly against either
France, Spain or both at once. The wide domain of the English language is
directly due to the Empire, just as the wide use of Spanish throughout South
and Central America is due to the Spanish Empire.

Including the Arabs? :-)

There are a number of ancient submarine designs, including one which was a
rowing boat with a watertight cover! The first practical submarine was (I
believe) designed by a Mr. Holland, resident of Ireland, for use against the
Royal Navy. The Royal Navy took over the design, but regarded such concealed
warfare as ungentlemanly, and didn't make much use of them until Germany
showed the way.

The jet plane was invented practically at the same time by Britain, Germany
and the U.S.A. Germany had the first flying jet aircraft, followed closely by
Britain. Britain would have had a jet fighter not long after the Battle of
Britain except for government intervention. Fortunately, Hitler was equally
stupid. The Nazis believed they would win the war in a couple of months, and
gave little interest to projects which would bear no short term military
results. When they did get the world's first jet fighter (the Me262) it was
pretty devastating, albeit rare, until Hitler decided that it would make a
great fighter-bomber. Two bombs were fitted under the nose, at the expense
of two cannon and much speed and agility. Fortunately, Nazi policy was "if
it doesn't work, stomp on whoever says so." The first American jet was too
late for WW2, and the first Russian jet had a captured German engine.

Now, for those who say "Why is this in sci.space?", read the above and apply

country should be sponsoring.

It's "the Making Of The Representative From Planet 8", if I remember right.
This is from the announcements to a Radio 3 broadcast of Glass's new orchestral
piece "The Light" - a tone poem about the Michelson-Morley experiments.

Incidentally, it's not the first SF opera. I heard a broadcast in New Zealand
of a Swedish opera called "Aniara", based on an epic poem about a colonizer
spaceship on its way to oblivion. I can remember neither the poet's nor the
composer's name.

I've only read the first of Lessing's series and didn't like it much. I felt I
was being preached at (Lessing is a Sufi - I don't know whether her having
been born in Iran has anything to with that - and it shows in her more recent
writing). OK, the content of the sermon may not have been as obnoxious as
Heinlein, Tolkien or Pournelle, but it was still gratuitous in literary terms.

Readers in the UK, and those elsewhere with UK contacts, may like to know...

(1) W.H.Smiths are stocking Asimov's "Fantastic Voyage II" in hardback,
UKL10.95.

(2) An organisation called Channel 5 Video, available at least in W.H.Smiths
and Woolworths, produces tapes of UFO, Thunderbirds, Captain Scarlet (under the
title "Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons", Stingray (yuk), and, of course,
the Prisoner. Each tape that I have seen contains two episodes of the
appropriate program. All cost less than UKL10.
What proportion of the total output of these programmes is available I can't
say, except for the Prisoner (100%).

Warning for foreign readers:
These tapes are VHS-PAL. According to "Which?" they work in Australia,
New Zealand, Europe except France, South Africa, and the Middle East, but not
North America.

A whole bunch of questions:


Does anybody run multiple subnets on a single Ethernet?

    If so, do you use subnet broadcasts or net broadcasts?
    Do you find it worthwhile to use ethernet multicast for
    subnet broadcasts? How do you assign the multicast addresses?
    For what purposes do you still use net broadcast?

    Should redirects be provided by an inter-subnet gateway,
    when both subnets are on the same Ethernet?


What are the semantics of 'ICMP redirect to net' in a subnettted environment?


Does anybody run multiple classes of subnet on a single net?

    Does the mechanism proposed in rfc950 ( ICMP broadcasts to
    discover the subnet mask ) still work? Do you use it?


Thanks for your time

I have just added some extra memory to a Sun 3.  Unfortunately, it did
not increase the usable amount of virtual memory.  I have been informed
(not by Sun I hasten to add), that 4.x will only allocate memory up to
the disk swap space size.  Adding more memory will speed things up but will
not increase your total usable virtual memory size (this is achieved by
increasing the swap space).  I was also informed that system V does not
inforce this type of restriction.

Well, the history repeats once again. A new RISC chip is launched and peopels
expectations reaches new "high scores". A few years ago there was another risc
chip set brougth to the market, called the Clipper. This processors performence
was climed to sweep all competitors off the sceene. Often compared to the
DEC 8x00 computers. For this chip set the picture has cleared now. The perfor-
mence range is not much more than can be achived with a 16-20 Mhz 68020. The
most i have seen of the 33Mhz versions is one running at room temprature.
Intergraph is one of the companys who is still using the Clipper (They recently
bought the rights for the chip set from NS/Fairchild) . From what i recall they
throw out the NS32032 for the Clipper. Well they could have had 2-3 times the
clipper performance with the NS32532 today. And they called the buy a bargin !
It's not suprising that the MIPS 2000 gives most power/Mhz, The architecture has
evolved during many years, without a hard pressure from the marketing such as
'We must have it NOW!!!'. (John Mashey mayby has another opinion, only my guess)

SO: Why is everybody so suprised ????!

On our systems, a small cron script executes every night the following
command:

	find / -print > /dirfile

Finding a file somewhere can be done by grepping in the /dirfile.
Of course, the contents of /dirfile are not really up-to-date, but this is
just a minor drawback. "find" on the whole system (including mounted disks)
takes more than an hour, a grep in /dirfile much less than a minute.

No, subranges occupy the same amount of space as the type they are
a subrange of. E.g. 0..255 will occupy two bytes. You may use a
CHAR or a BYTE, and convert to and from CARDINAL everytime you need

We're looking for a document conversion program.
It should translate MS-Word- to Q-ONE-documents.

Q-ONE offers conversions to several formats as:
Fortune:Word, Wang, IBM's DCA (RFT,FFT)
Therefor  programs to interchange documents between
MS-Word and these format would also help us.

Thanks in advance

Well, maybe that i've overlooked something really important, but i don't
see the 54MB limit with the AmigaDOS.
About a yaer ago, when there was no mount command, somebody from CATS
posted a sample device driver that mounted itself. It set up a device
structure which described the layout of the device. This structure is
now documented in dos/filehandler.h. One field in this structure holds
the number of longwords per block of this device. This is always set
to 128, giving 512 Bytes per Block.
Now, if i set this to 256 (1024 Bytes per Block), i should be able to
increase the disk limit to 108MB.
Apparently, AmigaDOS supports larger blocksizes. Just have a look into
the AmigaDOS Manual from Bantam. All block-layouts are described relative
to a 'SIZE', nowhere is said that SIZE is fixed to 128 !

So where is the problem ??? (Please, send no flames, only facts !)

There was a lot of discussion about how to get rid of my calls to _cleanup
earlier.  Here is the solution that I finally adopted.    The following commands
should do the job.
  cc -c -LIB exit.c putc.c
  ar r /usr/lib/libc.a exit.c putc.c
  ar x /usr/lib/libc.a cleanup.s
  ar d /usr/lib/libc.a cleanup.s
  ar bfork.s /usr/lib/libc.a cleanup.s

This requires the new archiver posted a while back (for the b option).
It also assumes that putting cleanup before fork.s will include cleanup.s
after exit.s and putc.s (check this).

I've not been very successful in getting Goswell's Xps to preview documents.
The Postscript file generated from TeX DVI files by dvi2ps and from Ditroff
files by the Transcript psdit program both cause it to choke, although in
different ways.

Is anyone using Xps successfully for TeX or Ditroff previewing?  Is there some
trick?

One thing to remember is that the partition size for partition 1 is one
smaller than for partition 2.

Another possibility is that the MINIX fdisk and the DOS fdisk don't agree
on the meaning of the partition table.  If everyone would create their
partitions from lowest cylinder to highest there would be no ambiguity.
However, if the order in the partition table is different from the cylinder
order, there are at least three interpretations.
  1. Table slot 1 is partition 1
  2. Innermost cylinder is partition 1
  3. Outermost cylinder is partition 1
I believe that the combination of MINIX, DOS, XENIX and Microport together
exhaust the entire list of possibilities.  I don'know if this is related
to your problem (which I otherwise can't understand), but it is worth 
keeping in mind.

If people are noticing and mentioning about Yar's breasts, why not
also mention about Troi's low cut outfit!!  Why does it need to be
so low cut that it shows her crevice?  Who is she trying to impress?
Do you think that the women in the future, working with men, will be
trying to dress sexy?  If so, what about the men?  Why not let them
show off their body too to make things even?   I think that the
producers, or whoever is in charge of outfits, and character development 
is making a contemporary decision regarding the issue of how people 
will dress in the future.  I.e. he/she thinks that female will be 
trying to attract males' attention by bringing out her femininity, 
but not vice versa, which is the current social behavior.
Or, perhaps the producers are just being comformists with bunch of 
other tv shows + movie producers by keeping females attractive 
towards men...

In the november issue of Dr.Dobb's Journal there is an article on how to
identify the video adaptor in your PC. They cover EGA,CGA,MDA,Compaq and
Hercules(mono).

What I need is information on how to find out if a VGA (or a PGA) adaptor
is installed.

Also - can someone tell me how to obtain the current cursor position directly
from these adaptors. That is - I need the location of the 6845 registers.

The reason I can not use the INT10 function provided is that my program has
to work with some TSR programs that access the hardware directly.

Thanks...

There was more to the 20th century reference than that, however.
Dr. Crusher made the point that, since they were only at the technology
level of ~20th century Earth, it was easy for the disease to get out of
control and spread over the planet.  The implication was that if they
were more advanced the disease would not have wiped out the entire world.
