eligible husband for their daughter than I was; and she, before taking the
last fatal step of giving her hand, might easily have said that I had
already given her mine, for I should have come forward to support any
assertion of hers to that effect. In short, I came to the conclusion that
feeble love, little reflection, great ambition, and a craving for rank,
had made her forget the words with which she had deceived me, encouraged
and supported by my firm hopes and honourable passion.
</p>
<p>
“Thus soliloquising and agitated, I journeyed onward for the remainder of
the night, and by daybreak I reached one of the passes of these mountains,
among which I wandered for three days more without taking any path or
road, until I came to some meadows lying on I know not which side of the
mountains, and there I inquired of some herdsmen in what direction the
most rugged part of the range lay. They told me that it was in this
quarter, and I at once directed my course hither, intending to end my life
here; but as I was making my way among these crags, my mule dropped dead
through fatigue and hunger, or, as I think more likely, in order to have
done with such a worthless burden as it bore in me. I was left on foot,
worn out, famishing, without anyone to help me or any thought of seeking
help: and so thus I lay stretched on the ground, how long I know not,
after which I rose up free from hunger, and found beside me some
goatherds, who no doubt were the persons who had relieved me in my need,
for they told me how they had found me, and how I had been uttering
ravings that showed plainly I had lost my reason; and since then I am
conscious that I am not always in full possession of it, but at times so
deranged and crazed that I do a thousand mad things, tearing my clothes,
crying aloud in these solitudes, cursing my fate, and idly calling on the
dear name of her who is my enemy, and only seeking to end my life in
lamentation; and when I recover my senses I find myself so exhausted and
weary that I can scarcely move. Most commonly my dwelling is the hollow of
a cork tree large enough to shelter this miserable body; the herdsmen and
goatherds who frequent these mountains, moved by compassion, furnish me
with food, leaving it by the wayside or on the rocks, where they think I
may perhaps pass and find it; and so, even though I may be then out of my
senses, the wants of nature teach me what is required to sustain me, and
make me crave it and eager to take it. At other times, so they tell me
when they find me in a rational mood, I sally out upon the road, and
though they would gladly give it me, I snatch food by force from the
shepherds bringing it from the village to their huts. Thus do pass the
wretched life that remains to me, until it be Heaven’s will to bring it to
a close, or so to order my memory that I no longer recollect the beauty
and treachery of Luscinda, or the wrong done me by Don Fernando; for if it
will do this without depriving me of life, I will turn my thoughts into
some better channel; if not, I can only implore it to have full mercy on
my soul, for in myself I feel no power or strength to release my body from
this strait in which I have of my own accord chosen to place it.
</p>
<p>
“Such, sirs, is the dismal story of my misfortune: say if it be one that
can be told with less emotion than you have seen in me; and do not trouble
yourselves with urging or pressing upon me what reason suggests as likely
to serve for my relief, for it will avail me as much as the medicine
prescribed by a wise physician avails the sick man who will not take it. I
have no wish for health without Luscinda; and since it is her pleasure to
be another’s, when she is or should be mine, let it be mine to be a prey
to misery when I might have enjoyed happiness. She by her fickleness
strove to make my ruin irretrievable; I will strive to gratify her wishes
by seeking destruction; and it will show generations to come that I alone
was deprived of that of which all others in misfortune have a
superabundance, for to them the impossibility of being consoled is itself
a consolation, while to me it is the cause of greater sorrows and
sufferings, for I think that even in death there will not be an end of
them.”
</p>
<p>
Here Cardenio brought to a close his long discourse and story, as full of
misfortune as it was of love; but just as the curate was going to address
some words of comfort to him, he was stopped by a voice that reached his
ear, saying in melancholy tones what will be told in the Fourth Part of
this narrative; for at this point the sage and sagacious historian, Cid
Hamete Benengeli, brought the Third to a conclusion.

Happy and fortunate were the times when that most daring knight Don
Quixote of La Mancha was sent into the world; for by reason of his having
formed a resolution so honourable as that of seeking to revive and restore
to the world the long-lost and almost defunct order of knight-errantry, we
now enjoy in this age of ours, so poor in light entertainment, not only
the charm of his veracious history, but also of the tales and episodes
contained in it which are, in a measure, no less pleasing, ingenious, and
truthful, than the history itself; which, resuming its thread, carded,
spun, and wound, relates that just as the curate was going to offer
consolation to Cardenio, he was interrupted by a voice that fell upon his
ear saying in plaintive tones:
</p>
<p>
“O God! is it possible I have found a place that may serve as a secret
grave for the weary load of this body that I support so unwillingly? If
the solitude these mountains promise deceives me not, it is so; ah! woe is
me! how much more grateful to my mind will be the society of these rocks
and brakes that permit me to complain of my misfortune to Heaven, than
that of any human being, for there is none on earth to look to for counsel
in doubt, comfort in sorrow, or relief in distress!”
</p>
<p>
All this was heard distinctly by the curate and those with him, and as it
seemed to them to be uttered close by, as indeed it was, they got up to
look for the speaker, and before they had gone twenty paces they
discovered behind a rock, seated at the foot of an ash tree, a youth in
the dress of a peasant, whose face they were unable at the moment to see
as he was leaning forward, bathing his feet in the brook that flowed past.
They approached so silently that he did not perceive them, being fully
occupied in bathing his feet, which were so fair that they looked like two
pieces of shining crystal brought forth among the other stones of the
brook. The whiteness and beauty of these feet struck them with surprise,
for they did not seem to have been made to crush clods or to follow the
plough and the oxen as their owner’s dress suggested; and so, finding they
had not been noticed, the curate, who was in front, made a sign to the
other two to conceal themselves behind some fragments of rock that lay
there; which they did, observing closely what the youth was about. He had
on a loose double-skirted dark brown jacket bound tight to his body with a
white cloth; he wore besides breeches and gaiters of brown cloth, and on
his head a brown montera; and he had the gaiters turned up as far as the
middle of the leg, which verily seemed to be of pure alabaster.
</p>
<p>
<br><br><br><br> <a id="c28b"></a>
</p>
<div class="fig" style="width:60%;">
<img alt="c28b.jpg (339K)" src="images/c28b.jpg" style="width:100%;" id="id-3890567255077123929">
</div>
<p>
<a href="images/c28b.jpg" style="width:100%;" id="id-7280809672246116925"><img alt="Full Size" src="images/enlarge.jpg" id="id-6570736109453773227"></a><br>
<br><br><br>
</p>
<p>
As soon as he had done bathing his beautiful feet, he wiped them with a
towel he took from under the montera, on taking off which he raised his
face, and those who were watching him had an opportunity of seeing a
beauty so exquisite that Cardenio said to the curate in a whisper:
</p>
<p>
“As this is not Luscinda, it is no human creature but a divine being.”
</p>
<p>
The youth then took off the montera, and shaking his head from side to
side there broke loose and spread out a mass of hair that the beams of the
sun might have envied; by this they knew that what had seemed a peasant
was a lovely woman, nay the most beautiful the eyes of two of them had
ever beheld, or even Cardenio’s if they had not seen and known Luscinda,
for he afterwards declared that only the beauty of Luscinda could compare
with this. The long auburn tresses not only covered her shoulders, but
such was their length and abundance, concealed her all round beneath their
masses, so that except the feet nothing of her form was visible. She now
used her hands as a comb, and if her feet had seemed like bits of crystal
in the water, her hands looked like pieces of driven snow among her locks;
all which increased not only the admiration of the three beholders, but
their anxiety to learn who she was. With this object they resolved to show
themselves, and at the stir they made in getting upon their feet the fair
damsel raised her head, and parting her hair from before her eyes with
both hands, she looked to see who had made the noise, and the instant she
perceived them she started to her feet, and without waiting to put on her
shoes or gather up her hair, hastily snatched up a bundle as though of
clothes that she had beside her, and, scared and alarmed, endeavoured to
take flight; but before she had gone six paces she fell to the ground, her
delicate feet being unable to bear the roughness of the stones; seeing
which, the three hastened towards her, and the curate addressing her first
said:
</p>
<p>
“Stay, señora, whoever you may be, for those whom you see here only desire
to be of service to you; you have no need to attempt a flight so heedless,
for neither can your feet bear it, nor we allow it.”
</p>
<p>
Taken by surprise and bewildered, she made no reply to these words. They,
however, came towards her, and the curate taking her hand went on to say:
</p>
<p>
“What your dress would hide, señora, is made known to us by your hair; a
clear proof that it can be no trifling cause that has disguised your
beauty in a garb so unworthy of it, and sent it into solitudes like these
where we have had the good fortune to find you, if not to relieve your
distress, at least to offer you comfort; for no distress, so long as life
lasts, can be so oppressive or reach such a height as to make the sufferer
refuse to listen to comfort offered with good intention. And so, señora,
or señor, or whatever you prefer to be, dismiss the fears that our
appearance has caused you and make us acquainted with your good or evil
fortunes, for from all of us together, or from each one of us, you will
receive sympathy in your trouble.”
</p>
<p>
While the curate was speaking, the disguised damsel stood as if
spell-bound, looking at them without opening her lips or uttering a word,
just like a village rustic to whom something strange that he has never
seen before has been suddenly shown; but on the curate addressing some
further words to the same effect to her, sighing deeply she broke silence
and said:
</p>
<p>
“Since the solitude of these mountains has been unable to conceal me, and
the escape of my dishevelled tresses will not allow my tongue to deal in
falsehoods, it would be idle for me now to make any further pretence of
what, if you were to believe me, you would believe more out of courtesy
than for any other reason. This being so, I say I thank you, sirs, for the
offer you have made me, which places me under the obligation of complying
with the request you have made of me; though I fear the account I shall
give you of my misfortunes will excite in you as much concern as
compassion, for you will be unable to suggest anything to remedy them or
any consolation to alleviate them. However, that my honour may not be left
a matter of doubt in your minds, now that you have discovered me to be a
woman, and see that I am young, alone, and in this dress, things that
taken together or separately would be enough to destroy any good name, I
feel bound to tell what I would willingly keep secret if I could.”
</p>
<p>
All this she who was now seen to be a lovely woman delivered without any
hesitation, with so much ease and in so sweet a voice that they were not
less charmed by her intelligence than by her beauty, and as they again
repeated their offers and entreaties to her to fulfil her promise, she
without further pressing, first modestly covering her feet and gathering
up her hair, seated herself on a stone with the three placed around her,
and, after an effort to restrain some tears that came to her eyes, in a
clear and steady voice began her story thus:
</p>
<p>
“In this Andalusia there is a town from which a duke takes a title which
makes him one of those that are called Grandees of Spain. This nobleman
has two sons, the elder heir to his dignity and apparently to his good
qualities; the younger heir to I know not what, unless it be the treachery
of Vellido and the falsehood of Ganelon. My parents are this lord’s
vassals, lowly in origin, but so wealthy that if birth had conferred as
much on them as fortune, they would have had nothing left to desire, nor
should I have had reason to fear trouble like that in which I find myself
now; for it may be that my ill fortune came of theirs in not having been
nobly born. It is true they are not so low that they have any reason to be
ashamed of their condition, but neither are they so high as to remove from
my mind the impression that my mishap comes of their humble birth. They
are, in short, peasants, plain homely people, without any taint of
disreputable blood, and, as the saying is, old rusty Christians, but so
rich that by their wealth and free-handed way of life they are coming by
degrees to be considered gentlefolk by birth, and even by position; though
the wealth and nobility they thought most of was having me for their
daughter; and as they have no other child to make their heir, and are
affectionate parents, I was one of the most indulged daughters that ever
parents indulged.
</p>
<p>
“I was the mirror in which they beheld themselves, the staff of their old
age, and the object in which, with submission to Heaven, all their wishes
centred, and mine were in accordance with theirs, for I knew their worth;
and as I was mistress of their hearts, so was I also of their possessions.
Through me they engaged or dismissed their servants; through my hands
passed the accounts and returns of what was sown and reaped; the
oil-mills, the wine-presses, the count of the flocks and herds, the
beehives, all in short that a rich farmer like my father has or can have,
I had under my care, and I acted as steward and mistress with an assiduity
on my part and satisfaction on theirs that I cannot well describe to you.
The leisure hours left to me after I had given the requisite orders to the
head-shepherds, overseers, and other labourers, I passed in such
employments as are not only allowable but necessary for young girls, those
that the needle, embroidery cushion, and spinning wheel usually afford,
and if to refresh my mind I quitted them for a while, I found recreation
in reading some devotional book or playing the harp, for experience taught
me that music soothes the troubled mind and relieves weariness of spirit.
Such was the life I led in my parents’ house and if I have depicted it
thus minutely, it is not out of ostentation, or to let you know that I am
rich, but that you may see how, without any fault of mine, I have fallen
from the happy condition I have described, to the misery I am in at
present. The truth is, that while I was leading this busy life, in a
retirement that might compare with that of a monastery, and unseen as I
thought by any except the servants of the house (for when I went to Mass
it was so early in the morning, and I was so closely attended by my mother
and the women of the household, and so thickly veiled and so shy, that my
eyes scarcely saw more ground than I trod on), in spite of all this, the
eyes of love, or idleness, more properly speaking, that the lynx’s cannot
rival, discovered me, with the help of the assiduity of Don Fernando; for
that is the name of the younger son of the duke I told of.”
</p>
<p>
The moment the speaker mentioned the name of Don Fernando, Cardenio
changed colour and broke into a sweat, with such signs of emotion that the
curate and the barber, who observed it, feared that one of the mad fits
which they heard attacked him sometimes was coming upon him; but Cardenio
showed no further agitation and remained quiet, regarding the peasant girl
with fixed attention, for he began to suspect who she was. She, however,
without noticing the excitement of Cardenio, continuing her story, went on
to say:
</p>
<p>
“And they had hardly discovered me, when, as he owned afterwards, he was
smitten with a violent love for me, as the manner in which it displayed
itself plainly showed. But to shorten the long recital of my woes, I will
pass over in silence all the artifices employed by Don Fernando for
declaring his passion for me. He bribed all the household, he gave and
offered gifts and presents to my parents; every day was like a holiday or
a merry-making in our street; by night no one could sleep for the music;
the love letters that used to come to my hand, no one knew how, were
innumerable, full of tender pleadings and pledges, containing more
promises and oaths than there were letters in them; all which not only did
not soften me, but hardened my heart against him, as if he had been my
mortal enemy, and as if everything he did to make me yield were done with
the opposite intention. Not that the high-bred bearing of Don Fernando was
disagreeable to me, or that I found his importunities wearisome; for it
gave me a certain sort of satisfaction to find myself so sought and prized
by a gentleman of such distinction, and I was not displeased at seeing my
praises in his letters (for however ugly we women may be, it seems to me
it always pleases us to hear ourselves called beautiful) but that my own
sense of right was opposed to all this, as well as the repeated advice of
my parents, who now very plainly perceived Don Fernando’s purpose, for he
cared very little if all the world knew it. They told me they trusted and
confided their honour and good name to my virtue and rectitude alone, and
bade me consider the disparity between Don Fernando and myself, from which
I might conclude that his intentions, whatever he might say to the
contrary, had for their aim his own pleasure rather than my advantage; and
if I were at all desirous of opposing an obstacle to his unreasonable
suit, they were ready, they said, to marry me at once to anyone I
preferred, either among the leading people of our own town, or of any of
those in the neighbourhood; for with their wealth and my good name, a
match might be looked for in any quarter. This offer, and their sound
advice strengthened my resolution, and I never gave Don Fernando a word in
reply that could hold out to him any hope of success, however remote.

“All this caution of mine, which he must have taken for coyness, had
apparently the effect of increasing his wanton appetite—for that is
the name I give to his passion for me; had it been what he declared it to
be, you would not know of it now, because there would have been no
occasion to tell you of it. At length he learned that my parents were
contemplating marriage for me in order to put an end to his hopes of
obtaining possession of me, or at least to secure additional protectors to
watch over me, and this intelligence or suspicion made him act as you
shall hear. One night, as I was in my chamber with no other companion than
a damsel who waited on me, with the doors carefully locked lest my honour
should be imperilled through any carelessness, I know not nor can conceive
how it happened, but, with all this seclusion and these precautions, and
in the solitude and silence of my retirement, I found him standing before
me, a vision that so astounded me that it deprived my eyes of sight, and
my tongue of speech. I had no power to utter a cry, nor, I think, did he
give me time to utter one, as he immediately approached me, and taking me
in his arms (for, overwhelmed as I was, I was powerless, I say, to help
myself), he began to make such professions to me that I know not how
falsehood could have had the power of dressing them up to seem so like
truth; and the traitor contrived that his tears should vouch for his
words, and his sighs for his sincerity.
</p>
<p>
“I, a poor young creature alone, ill versed among my people in cases such
as this, began, I know not how, to think all these lying protestations
true, though without being moved by his sighs and tears to anything more
than pure compassion; and so, as the first feeling of bewilderment passed
away, and I began in some degree to recover myself, I said to him with
more courage than I thought I could have possessed, ‘If, as I am now in
your arms, señor, I were in the claws of a fierce lion, and my deliverance
could be procured by doing or saying anything to the prejudice of my
honour, it would no more be in my power to do it or say it, than it would
be possible that what was should not have been; so then, if you hold my
body clasped in your arms, I hold my soul secured by virtuous intentions,
very different from yours, as you will see if you attempt to carry them
into effect by force. I am your vassal, but I am not your slave; your
nobility neither has nor should have any right to dishonour or degrade my
humble birth; and low-born peasant as I am, I have my self-respect as much
as you, a lord and gentleman: with me your violence will be to no purpose,
your wealth will have no weight, your words will have no power to deceive
me, nor your sighs or tears to soften me: were I to see any of the things
I speak of in him whom my parents gave me as a husband, his will should be
mine, and mine should be bounded by his; and my honour being preserved
even though my inclinations were not would willingly yield him what you,
señor, would now obtain by force; and this I say lest you should suppose
that any but my lawful husband shall ever win anything of me.’ ‘If that,’
said this disloyal gentleman, ‘be the only scruple you feel, fairest
Dorothea’ (for that is the name of this unhappy being), ‘see here I give
you my hand to be yours, and let Heaven, from which nothing is hid, and
this image of Our Lady you have here, be witnesses of this pledge.’”
</p>
<p>
<br><br><br><br> <a id="c28d"></a>
</p>
<div class="fig" style="width:60%;">

<br><br><br>
</p>
<p>
When Cardenio heard her say she was called Dorothea, he showed fresh
agitation and felt convinced of the truth of his former suspicion, but he
was unwilling to interrupt the story, and wished to hear the end of what
he already all but knew, so he merely said:
</p>
<p>
“What! is Dorothea your name, señora? I have heard of another of the same
name who can perhaps match your misfortunes. But proceed; by-and-by I may
tell you something that will astonish you as much as it will excite your
compassion.”
</p>
<p>
Dorothea was struck by Cardenio’s words as well as by his strange and
miserable attire, and begged him if he knew anything concerning her to
tell it to her at once, for if fortune had left her any blessing it was
courage to bear whatever calamity might fall upon her, as she felt sure
that none could reach her capable of increasing in any degree what she
endured already.
</p>
<p>
“I would not let the occasion pass, señora,” replied Cardenio, “of telling
you what I think, if what I suspect were the truth, but so far there has
been no opportunity, nor is it of any importance to you to know it.”
</p>
<p>
“Be it as it may,” replied Dorothea, “what happened in my story was that
Don Fernando, taking an image that stood in the chamber, placed it as a
witness of our betrothal, and with the most binding words and extravagant
oaths gave me his promise to become my husband; though before he had made
an end of pledging himself I bade him consider well what he was doing, and
think of the anger his father would feel at seeing him married to a
peasant girl and one of his vassals; I told him not to let my beauty, such
as it was, blind him, for that was not enough to furnish an excuse for his
transgression; and if in the love he bore me he wished to do me any
kindness, it would be to leave my lot to follow its course at the level my
condition required; for marriages so unequal never brought happiness, nor
did they continue long to afford the enjoyment they began with.
</p>
<p>
“All this that I have now repeated I said to him, and much more which I
cannot recollect; but it had no effect in inducing him to forego his
purpose; he who has no intention of paying does not trouble himself about
difficulties when he is striking the bargain. At the same time I argued
the matter briefly in my own mind, saying to myself, ‘I shall not be the
first who has risen through marriage from a lowly to a lofty station, nor
will Don Fernando be the first whom beauty or, as is more likely, a blind
attachment, has led to mate himself below his rank. Then, since I am
introducing no new usage or practice, I may as well avail myself of the
honour that chance offers me, for even though his inclination for me
should not outlast the attainment of his wishes, I shall be, after all,
his wife before God. And if I strive to repel him by scorn, I can see
that, fair means failing, he is in a mood to use force, and I shall be
left dishonoured and without any means of proving my innocence to those
who cannot know how innocently I have come to be in this position; for
what arguments would persuade my parents that this gentleman entered my
chamber without my consent?’
</p>
<p>
“All these questions and answers passed through my mind in a moment; but
the oaths of Don Fernando, the witnesses he appealed to, the tears he
shed, and lastly the charms of his person and his high-bred grace, which,
accompanied by such signs of genuine love, might well have conquered a
heart even more free and coy than mine—these were the things that
more than all began to influence me and lead me unawares to my ruin. I
called my waiting-maid to me, that there might be a witness on earth
besides those in Heaven, and again Don Fernando renewed and repeated his
oaths, invoked as witnesses fresh saints in addition to the former ones,
called down upon himself a thousand curses hereafter should he fail to
keep his promise, shed more tears, redoubled his sighs and pressed me
closer in his arms, from which he had never allowed me to escape; and so I
was left by my maid, and ceased to be one, and he became a traitor and a
perjured man.
</p>
<p>
“The day which followed the night of my misfortune did not come so
quickly, I imagine, as Don Fernando wished, for when desire has attained
its object, the greatest pleasure is to fly from the scene of pleasure. I
say so because Don Fernando made all haste to leave me, and by the
adroitness of my maid, who was indeed the one who had admitted him, gained
the street before daybreak; but on taking leave of me he told me, though
not with as much earnestness and fervour as when he came, that I might
rest assured of his faith and of the sanctity and sincerity of his oaths;
and to confirm his words he drew a rich ring off his finger and placed it
upon mine. He then took his departure and I was left, I know not whether
sorrowful or happy; all I can say is, I was left agitated and troubled in
mind and almost bewildered by what had taken place, and I had not the
spirit, or else it did not occur to me, to chide my maid for the treachery
she had been guilty of in concealing Don Fernando in my chamber; for as
yet I was unable to make up my mind whether what had befallen me was for
good or evil. I told Don Fernando at parting, that as I was now his, he
might see me on other nights in the same way, until it should be his
pleasure to let the matter become known; but, except the following night,
he came no more, nor for more than a month could I catch a glimpse of him
in the street or in church, while I wearied myself with watching for one;
although I knew he was in the town, and almost every day went out hunting,
a pastime he was very fond of. I remember well how sad and dreary those
days and hours were to me; I remember well how I began to doubt as they
went by, and even to lose confidence in the faith of Don Fernando; and I
remember, too, how my maid heard those words in reproof of her audacity
that she had not heard before, and how I was forced to put a constraint on
my tears and on the expression of my countenance, not to give my parents
cause to ask me why I was so melancholy, and drive me to invent falsehoods
in reply. But all this was suddenly brought to an end, for the time came
when all such considerations were disregarded, and there was no further
question of honour, when my patience gave way and the secret of my heart
became known abroad. The reason was, that a few days later it was reported
in the town that Don Fernando had been married in a neighbouring city to a
maiden of rare beauty, the daughter of parents of distinguished position,
though not so rich that her portion would entitle her to look for so
brilliant a match; it was said, too, that her name was Luscinda, and that
at the betrothal some strange things had happened.”
</p>
<p>
Cardenio heard the name of Luscinda, but he only shrugged his shoulders,
bit his lips, bent his brows, and before long two streams of tears escaped
from his eyes. Dorothea, however, did not interrupt her story, but went on
in these words:
</p>
<p>
“This sad intelligence reached my ears, and, instead of being struck with
a chill, with such wrath and fury did my heart burn that I scarcely
restrained myself from rushing out into the streets, crying aloud and
proclaiming openly the perfidy and treachery of which I was the victim;
but this transport of rage was for the time checked by a resolution I
formed, to be carried out the same night, and that was to assume this
dress, which I got from a servant of my father’s, one of the zagals, as
they are called in farmhouses, to whom I confided the whole of my
misfortune, and whom I entreated to accompany me to the city where I heard
my enemy was. He, though he remonstrated with me for my boldness, and
condemned my resolution, when he saw me bent upon my purpose, offered to
bear me company, as he said, to the end of the world. I at once packed up
in a linen pillow-case a woman’s dress, and some jewels and money to
provide for emergencies, and in the silence of the night, without letting
my treacherous maid know, I sallied forth from the house, accompanied by
my servant and abundant anxieties, and on foot set out for the city, but
borne as it were on wings by my eagerness to reach it, if not to prevent
what I presumed to be already done, at least to call upon Don Fernando to
tell me with what conscience he had done it. I reached my destination in
two days and a half, and on entering the city inquired for the house of
Luscinda’s parents. The first person I asked gave me more in reply than I
sought to know; he showed me the house, and told me all that had occurred
at the betrothal of the daughter of the family, an affair of such
notoriety in the city that it was the talk of every knot of idlers in the
street. He said that on the night of Don Fernando’s betrothal with
Luscinda, as soon as she had consented to be his bride by saying ‘Yes,’
she was taken with a sudden fainting fit, and that on the bridegroom
approaching to unlace the bosom of her dress to give her air, he found a
paper in her own handwriting, in which she said and declared that she
could not be Don Fernando’s bride, because she was already Cardenio’s,
who, according to the man’s account, was a gentleman of distinction of the
same city; and that if she had accepted Don Fernando, it was only in
obedience to her parents. In short, he said, the words of the paper made
it clear she meant to kill herself on the completion of the betrothal, and
gave her reasons for putting an end to herself all which was confirmed, it
was said, by a dagger they found somewhere in her clothes. On seeing this,
Don Fernando, persuaded that Luscinda had befooled, slighted, and trifled
with him, assailed her before she had recovered from her swoon, and tried
to stab her with the dagger that had been found, and would have succeeded
had not her parents and those who were present prevented him. It was said,
moreover, that Don Fernando went away at once, and that Luscinda did not
recover from her prostration until the next day, when she told her parents
how she was really the bride of that Cardenio I have mentioned. I learned
besides that Cardenio, according to report, had been present at the
betrothal; and that upon seeing her betrothed contrary to his expectation,
he had quitted the city in despair, leaving behind him a letter declaring
the wrong Luscinda had done him, and his intention of going where no one
should ever see him again. All this was a matter of notoriety in the city,
and everyone spoke of it; especially when it became known that Luscinda
was missing from her father’s house and from the city, for she was not to
be found anywhere, to the distraction of her parents, who knew not what
steps to take to recover her. What I learned revived my hopes, and I was
better pleased not to have found Don Fernando than to find him married,
for it seemed to me that the door was not yet entirely shut upon relief in
my case, and I thought that perhaps Heaven had put this impediment in the
way of the second marriage, to lead him to recognise his obligations under
the former one, and reflect that as a Christian he was bound to consider
his soul above all human objects. All this passed through my mind, and I
strove to comfort myself without comfort, indulging in faint and distant
hopes of cherishing that life that I now abhor.
</p>
<p>
“But while I was in the city, uncertain what to do, as I could not find
Don Fernando, I heard notice given by the public crier offering a great
reward to anyone who should find me, and giving the particulars of my age
and of the very dress I wore; and I heard it said that the lad who came
with me had taken me away from my father’s house; a thing that cut me to
the heart, showing how low my good name had fallen, since it was not
enough that I should lose it by my flight, but they must add with whom I
had fled, and that one so much beneath me and so unworthy of my
consideration. The instant I heard the notice I quitted the city with my
servant, who now began to show signs of wavering in his fidelity to me,
and the same night, for fear of discovery, we entered the most thickly
wooded part of these mountains. But, as is commonly said, one evil calls
up another and the end of one misfortune is apt to be the beginning of one
still greater, and so it proved in my case; for my worthy servant, until
then so faithful and trusty when he found me in this lonely spot, moved
more by his own villainy than by my beauty, sought to take advantage of
the opportunity which these solitudes seemed to present him, and with
little shame and less fear of God and respect for me, began to make
overtures to me; and finding that I replied to the effrontery of his
proposals with justly severe language, he laid aside the entreaties which
he had employed at first, and began to use violence.

“But just Heaven, that seldom fails to watch over and aid good intentions,
so aided mine that with my slight strength and with little exertion I
pushed him over a precipice, where I left him, whether dead or alive I
know not; and then, with greater speed than seemed possible in my terror
and fatigue, I made my way into the mountains, without any other thought
or purpose save that of hiding myself among them, and escaping my father
and those despatched in search of me by his orders. It is now I know not
how many months since with this object I came here, where I met a herdsman
who engaged me as his servant at a place in the heart of this Sierra, and
all this time I have been serving him as herd, striving to keep always
afield to hide these locks which have now unexpectedly betrayed me. But
all my care and pains were unavailing, for my master made the discovery
that I was not a man, and harboured the same base designs as my servant;
and as fortune does not always supply a remedy in cases of difficulty, and
I had no precipice or ravine at hand down which to fling the master and
cure his passion, as I had in the servant’s case, I thought it a lesser
evil to leave him and again conceal myself among these crags, than make
trial of my strength and argument with him. So, as I say, once more I went
into hiding to seek for some place where I might with sighs and tears
implore Heaven to have pity on my misery, and grant me help and strength
to escape from it, or let me die among the solitudes, leaving no trace of
an unhappy being who, by no fault of hers, has furnished matter for talk
and scandal at home and abroad.”

“Such, sirs, is the true story of my sad adventures; judge for yourselves
now whether the sighs and lamentations you heard, and the tears that
flowed from my eyes, had not sufficient cause even if I had indulged in
them more freely; and if you consider the nature of my misfortune you will
see that consolation is idle, as there is no possible remedy for it. All I
ask of you is, what you may easily and reasonably do, to show me where I
may pass my life unharassed by the fear and dread of discovery by those
who are in search of me; for though the great love my parents bear me
makes me feel sure of being kindly received by them, so great is my
feeling of shame at the mere thought that I cannot present myself before
them as they expect, that I had rather banish myself from their sight for
ever than look them in the face with the reflection that they beheld mine
stripped of that purity they had a right to expect in me.”
</p>
<p>
With these words she became silent, and the colour that overspread her
face showed plainly the pain and shame she was suffering at heart. In
theirs the listeners felt as much pity as wonder at her misfortunes; but
as the curate was just about to offer her some consolation and advice
Cardenio forestalled him, saying, “So then, señora, you are the fair
Dorothea, the only daughter of the rich Clenardo?” Dorothea was astonished
at hearing her father’s name, and at the miserable appearance of him who
mentioned it, for it has been already said how wretchedly clad Cardenio
was; so she said to him:
</p>
<p>
“And who may you be, brother, who seem to know my father’s name so well?
For so far, if I remember rightly, I have not mentioned it in the whole
story of my misfortunes.”
</p>
<p>
“I am that unhappy being, señora,” replied Cardenio, “whom, as you have
said, Luscinda declared to be her husband; I am the unfortunate Cardenio,
whom the wrong-doing of him who has brought you to your present condition
has reduced to the state you see me in, bare, ragged, bereft of all human
comfort, and what is worse, of reason, for I only possess it when Heaven
is pleased for some short space to restore it to me. I, Dorothea, am he
who witnessed the wrong done by Don Fernando, and waited to hear the ‘Yes’
uttered by which Luscinda owned herself his betrothed: I am he who had not
courage enough to see how her fainting fit ended, or what came of the
paper that was found in her bosom, because my heart had not the fortitude
to endure so many strokes of ill-fortune at once; and so losing patience I
quitted the house, and leaving a letter with my host, which I entreated
him to place in Luscinda’s hands, I betook myself to these solitudes,
resolved to end here the life I hated as if it were my mortal enemy. But
fate would not rid me of it, contenting itself with robbing me of my
reason, perhaps to preserve me for the good fortune I have had in meeting
you; for if that which you have just told us be true, as I believe it to
be, it may be that Heaven has yet in store for both of us a happier
termination to our misfortunes than we look for; because seeing that
Luscinda cannot marry Don Fernando, being mine, as she has herself so
openly declared, and that Don Fernando cannot marry her as he is yours, we
may reasonably hope that Heaven will restore to us what is ours, as it is
still in existence and not yet alienated or destroyed. And as we have this
consolation springing from no very visionary hope or wild fancy, I entreat
you, señora, to form new resolutions in your better mind, as I mean to do
in mine, preparing yourself to look forward to happier fortunes; for I
swear to you by the faith of a gentleman and a Christian not to desert you
until I see you in possession of Don Fernando, and if I cannot by words
induce him to recognise his obligation to you, in that case to avail
myself of the right which my rank as a gentleman gives me, and with just
cause challenge him on account of the injury he has done you, not
regarding my own wrongs, which I shall leave to Heaven to avenge, while I
on earth devote myself to yours.”
</p>
<p>
Cardenio’s words completed the astonishment of Dorothea, and not knowing
how to return thanks for such an offer, she attempted to kiss his feet;
but Cardenio would not permit it, and the licentiate replied for both,
commended the sound reasoning of Cardenio, and lastly, begged, advised,
and urged them to come with him to his village, where they might furnish
themselves with what they needed, and take measures to discover Don
Fernando, or restore Dorothea to her parents, or do what seemed to them
most advisable. Cardenio and Dorothea thanked him, and accepted the kind
offer he made them; and the barber, who had been listening to all
attentively and in silence, on his part some kindly words also, and with
no less good-will than the curate offered his services in any way that
might be of use to them. He also explained to them in a few words the
object that had brought them there, and the strange nature of Don
Quixote’s madness, and how they were waiting for his squire, who had gone
in search of him. Like the recollection of a dream, the quarrel he had had
with Don Quixote came back to Cardenio’s memory, and he described it to
the others; but he was unable to say what the dispute was about.

</p>
<p>
At this moment they heard a shout, and recognised it as coming from Sancho
Panza, who, not finding them where he had left them, was calling aloud to
them. They went to meet him, and in answer to their inquiries about Don
Quixote, he told them how he had found him stripped to his shirt, lank,
yellow, half dead with hunger, and sighing for his lady Dulcinea; and
although he had told him that she commanded him to quit that place and
come to El Toboso, where she was expecting him, he had answered that he
was determined not to appear in the presence of her beauty until he had
done deeds to make him worthy of her favour; and if this went on, Sancho
said, he ran the risk of not becoming an emperor as in duty bound, or even
an archbishop, which was the least he could be; for which reason they
ought to consider what was to be done to get him away from there. The
licentiate in reply told him not to be uneasy, for they would fetch him
away in spite of himself. He then told Cardenio and Dorothea what they had
proposed to do to cure Don Quixote, or at any rate take him home; upon
which Dorothea said that she could play the distressed damsel better than
the barber; especially as she had there the dress in which to do it to the
life, and that they might trust to her acting the part in every particular
requisite for carrying out their scheme, for she had read a great many
books of chivalry, and knew exactly the style in which afflicted damsels
begged boons of knights-errant.
</p>
<p>
“In that case,” said the curate, “there is nothing more required than to
set about it at once, for beyond a doubt fortune is declaring itself in
our favour, since it has so unexpectedly begun to open a door for your
relief, and smoothed the way for us to our object.”
</p>
<p>
Dorothea then took out of her pillow-case a complete petticoat of some
rich stuff, and a green mantle of some other fine material, and a necklace
and other ornaments out of a little box, and with these in an instant she
so arrayed herself that she looked like a great and rich lady. All this,
and more, she said, she had taken from home in case of need, but that
until then she had had no occasion to make use of it. They were all highly
delighted with her grace, air, and beauty, and declared Don Fernando to be
a man of very little taste when he rejected such charms. But the one who
admired her most was Sancho Panza, for it seemed to him (what indeed was
true) that in all the days of his life he had never seen such a lovely
creature; and he asked the curate with great eagerness who this beautiful
lady was, and what she wanted in these out-of-the-way quarters.
</p>
<p>
“This fair lady, brother Sancho,” replied the curate, “is no less a
personage than the heiress in the direct male line of the great kingdom of
Micomicon, who has come in search of your master to beg a boon of him,
which is that he redress a wrong or injury that a wicked giant has done
her; and from the fame as a good knight which your master has acquired far
and wide, this princess has come from Guinea to seek him.”
</p>
<p>
“A lucky seeking and a lucky finding!” said Sancho Panza at this;
“especially if my master has the good fortune to redress that injury, and
right that wrong, and kill that son of a bitch of a giant your worship
speaks of; as kill him he will if he meets him, unless, indeed, he happens
to be a phantom; for my master has no power at all against phantoms. But
one thing among others I would beg of you, señor licentiate, which is,
that, to prevent my master taking a fancy to be an archbishop, for that is
what I’m afraid of, your worship would recommend him to marry this
princess at once; for in this way he will be disabled from taking
archbishop’s orders, and will easily come into his empire, and I to the
end of my desires; I have been thinking over the matter carefully, and by
what I can make out I find it will not do for me that my master should
become an archbishop, because I am no good for the Church, as I am
married; and for me now, having as I have a wife and children, to set
about obtaining dispensations to enable me to hold a place of profit under
the Church, would be endless work; so that, señor, it all turns on my
master marrying this lady at once—for as yet I do not know her
grace, and so I cannot call her by her name.”
</p>
<p>
“She is called the Princess Micomicona,” said the curate; “for as her
kingdom is Micomicon, it is clear that must be her name.”
</p>
<p>
“There’s no doubt of that,” replied Sancho, “for I have known many to take
their name and title from the place where they were born and call
themselves Pedro of Alcalá, Juan of Úbeda, and Diego of Valladolid; and it
may be that over there in Guinea queens have the same way of taking the
names of their kingdoms.”
</p>
<p>
“So it may,” said the curate; “and as for your master’s marrying, I will
do all in my power towards it:” with which Sancho was as much pleased as
the curate was amazed at his simplicity and at seeing what a hold the
absurdities of his master had taken of his fancy, for he had evidently
persuaded himself that he was going to be an emperor.
</p>
<p>
By this time Dorothea had seated herself upon the curate’s mule, and the
barber had fitted the ox-tail beard to his face, and they now told Sancho
to conduct them to where Don Quixote was, warning him not to say that he
knew either the licentiate or the barber, as his master’s becoming an
emperor entirely depended on his not recognising them; neither the curate
nor Cardenio, however, thought fit to go with them; Cardenio lest he
should remind Don Quixote of the quarrel he had with him, and the curate
as there was no necessity for his presence just yet, so they allowed the
others to go on before them, while they themselves followed slowly on
foot. The curate did not forget to instruct Dorothea how to act, but she
said they might make their minds easy, as everything would be done exactly
as the books of chivalry required and described.
</p>
<p>
<br><br><br><br> <a id="c29c"></a>
</p>
<div class="fig" style="width:60%;">

<br><br><br>
</p>
<p>
They had gone about three-quarters of a league when they discovered Don
Quixote in a wilderness of rocks, by this time clothed, but without his
armour; and as soon as Dorothea saw him and was told by Sancho that that
was Don Quixote, she whipped her palfrey, the well-bearded barber
following her, and on coming up to him her squire sprang from his mule and
came forward to receive her in his arms, and she dismounting with great
ease of manner advanced to kneel before the feet of Don Quixote; and
though he strove to raise her up, she without rising addressed him in this
fashion:
</p>
<p>
“From this spot I will not rise, valiant and doughty knight, until your
goodness and courtesy grant me a boon, which will redound to the honour
and renown of your person and render a service to the most disconsolate
and afflicted damsel the sun has seen; and if the might of your strong arm
corresponds to the repute of your immortal fame, you are bound to aid the
helpless being who, led by the savour of your renowned name, hath come
from far distant lands to seek your aid in her misfortunes.”
</p>
<p>
“I will not answer a word, beauteous lady,” replied Don Quixote, “nor will
I listen to anything further concerning you, until you rise from the
earth.”
</p>
<p>
“I will not rise, señor,” answered the afflicted damsel, “unless of your
courtesy the boon I ask is first granted me.”
</p>
<p>
“I grant and accord it,” said Don Quixote, “provided without detriment or
prejudice to my king, my country, or her who holds the key of my heart and
freedom, it may be complied with.”
</p>
<p>
“It will not be to the detriment or prejudice of any of them, my worthy
lord,” said the afflicted damsel; and here Sancho Panza drew close to his
master’s ear and said to him very softly, “Your worship may very safely
grant the boon she asks; it’s nothing at all; only to kill a big giant;
and she who asks it is the exalted Princess Micomicona, queen of the great
kingdom of Micomicon of Ethiopia.”
</p>
<p>
“Let her be who she may,” replied Don Quixote, “I will do what is my
bounden duty, and what my conscience bids me, in conformity with what I
have professed;” and turning to the damsel he said, “Let your great beauty
rise, for I grant the boon which you would ask of me.”
</p>
<p>
“Then what I ask,” said the damsel, “is that your magnanimous person
accompany me at once whither I will conduct you, and that you promise not
to engage in any other adventure or quest until you have avenged me of a
traitor who against all human and divine law, has usurped my kingdom.”
</p>
<p>
“I repeat that I grant it,” replied Don Quixote; “and so, lady, you may
from this day forth lay aside the melancholy that distresses you, and let
your failing hopes gather new life and strength, for with the help of God
and of my arm you will soon see yourself restored to your kingdom, and
seated upon the throne of your ancient and mighty realm, notwithstanding
and despite of the felons who would gainsay it; and now hands to the work,
for in delay there is apt to be danger.”
</p>
<p>
The distressed damsel strove with much pertinacity to kiss his hands; but
Don Quixote, who was in all things a polished and courteous knight, would
by no means allow it, but made her rise and embraced her with great
courtesy and politeness, and ordered Sancho to look to Rocinante’s girths,
and to arm him without a moment’s delay. Sancho took down the armour,
which was hung up on a tree like a trophy, and having seen to the girths
armed his master in a trice, who as soon as he found himself in his armour
exclaimed:
</p>
<p>
“Let us be gone in the name of God to bring aid to this great lady.”
</p>
<p>
The barber was all this time on his knees at great pains to hide his
laughter and not let his beard fall, for had it fallen maybe their fine
scheme would have come to nothing; but now seeing the boon granted, and
the promptitude with which Don Quixote prepared to set out in compliance
with it, he rose and took his lady’s hand, and between them they placed
her upon the mule. Don Quixote then mounted Rocinante, and the barber
settled himself on his beast, Sancho being left to go on foot, which made
him feel anew the loss of his Dapple, finding the want of him now. But he
bore all with cheerfulness, being persuaded that his master had now fairly
started and was just on the point of becoming an emperor; for he felt no
doubt at all that he would marry this princess, and be king of Micomicon
at least. The only thing that troubled him was the reflection that this
kingdom was in the land of the blacks, and that the people they would give
him for vassals would be all black; but for this he soon found a remedy in
his fancy, and said he to himself, “What is it to me if my vassals are
blacks? What more have I to do than make a cargo of them and carry them to
Spain, where I can sell them and get ready money for them, and with it buy
some title or some office in which to live at ease all the days of my
life? Not unless you go to sleep and haven’t the wit or skill to turn
things to account and sell three, six, or ten thousand vassals while you
would be talking about it! By God I will stir them up, big and little, or
as best I can, and let them be ever so black I’ll turn them into white or
yellow. Come, come, what a fool I am!” And so he jogged on, so occupied
with his thoughts and easy in his mind that he forgot all about the
hardship of travelling on foot.
</p>
<p>
Cardenio and the curate were watching all this from among some bushes, not
knowing how to join company with the others; but the curate, who was very
fertile in devices, soon hit upon a way of effecting their purpose, and
with a pair of scissors he had in a case he quickly cut off Cardenio’s
beard, and putting on him a grey jerkin of his own he gave him a black
cloak, leaving himself in his breeches and doublet, while Cardenio’s
appearance was so different from what it had been that he would not have
known himself had he seen himself in a mirror. Having effected this,
although the others had gone on ahead while they were disguising
themselves, they easily came out on the high road before them, for the
brambles and awkward places they encountered did not allow those on
horseback to go as fast as those on foot. They then posted themselves on
the level ground at the outlet of the Sierra, and as soon as Don Quixote
and his companions emerged from it the curate began to examine him very
deliberately, as though he were striving to recognise him, and after
having stared at him for some time he hastened towards him with open arms
exclaiming, “A happy meeting with the mirror of chivalry, my worthy
compatriot Don Quixote of La Mancha, the flower and cream of high
breeding, the protection and relief of the distressed, the quintessence of
knights-errant!” And so saying he clasped in his arms the knee of Don
Quixote’s left leg. He, astonished at the stranger’s words and behaviour,
looked at him attentively, and at length recognised him, very much
surprised to see him there, and made great efforts to dismount. This,
however, the curate would not allow, on which Don Quixote said, “Permit
me, señor licentiate, for it is not fitting that I should be on horseback
and so reverend a person as your worship on foot.”
</p>
<p>
“On no account will I allow it,” said the curate; “your mightiness must
remain on horseback, for it is on horseback you achieve the greatest deeds
and adventures that have been beheld in our age; as for me, an unworthy
priest, it will serve me well enough to mount on the haunches of one of
the mules of these gentlefolk who accompany your worship, if they have no
objection, and I will fancy I am mounted on the steed Pegasus, or on the
zebra or charger that bore the famous Moor, Muzaraque, who to this day
lies enchanted in the great hill of Zulema, a little distance from the
great Complutum.”
</p>
<p>
“Nor even that will I consent to, señor licentiate,” answered Don Quixote,
“and I know it will be the good pleasure of my lady the princess, out of
love for me, to order her squire to give up the saddle of his mule to your
worship, and he can sit behind if the beast will bear it.”
</p>
<p>
“It will, I am sure,” said the princess, “and I am sure, too, that I need
not order my squire, for he is too courteous and considerate to allow a
Churchman to go on foot when he might be mounted.”
</p>
<p>
“That he is,” said the barber, and at once alighting, he offered his
saddle to the curate, who accepted it without much entreaty; but
unfortunately as the barber was mounting behind, the mule, being as it
happened a hired one, which is the same thing as saying ill-conditioned,
lifted its hind hoofs and let fly a couple of kicks in the air, which
would have made Master Nicholas wish his expedition in quest of Don
Quixote at the devil had they caught him on the breast or head. As it was,
they so took him by surprise that he came to the ground, giving so little
heed to his beard that it fell off, and all he could do when he found
himself without it was to cover his face hastily with both his hands and
moan that his teeth were knocked out. Don Quixote when he saw all that
bundle of beard detached, without jaws or blood, from the face of the
fallen squire, exclaimed:
</p>
<p>
“By the living God, but this is a great miracle! it has knocked off and
plucked away the beard from his face as if it had been shaved off
designedly.”
</p>
<p>
The curate, seeing the danger of discovery that threatened his scheme, at
once pounced upon the beard and hastened with it to where Master Nicholas
lay, still uttering moans, and drawing his head to his breast had it on in
an instant, muttering over him some words which he said were a certain
special charm for sticking on beards, as they would see; and as soon as he
had it fixed he left him, and the squire appeared well bearded and whole
as before, whereat Don Quixote was beyond measure astonished, and begged
the curate to teach him that charm when he had an opportunity, as he was
persuaded its virtue must extend beyond the sticking on of beards, for it
was clear that where the beard had been stripped off the flesh must have
remained torn and lacerated, and when it could heal all that it must be
good for more than beards.
</p>
<p>
“And so it is,” said the curate, and he promised to teach it to him on the
first opportunity. They then agreed that for the present the curate should
mount, and that the three should ride by turns until they reached the inn,
which might be about six leagues from where they were.
</p>
<p>
Three then being mounted, that is to say, Don Quixote, the princess, and
the curate, and three on foot, Cardenio, the barber, and Sancho Panza, Don
Quixote said to the damsel:
</p>
<p>
“Let your highness, lady, lead on whithersoever is most pleasing to you;”
but before she could answer the licentiate said:
</p>
<p>

<p>
“Towards what kingdom would your ladyship direct our course? Is it
perchance towards that of Micomicon? It must be, or else I know little
about kingdoms.”
</p>
<p>
She, being ready on all points, understood that she was to answer “Yes,”
so she said “Yes, señor, my way lies towards that kingdom.”
</p>
<p>
“In that case,” said the curate, “we must pass right through my village,
and there your worship will take the road to Cartagena, where you will be
able to embark, fortune favouring; and if the wind be fair and the sea
smooth and tranquil, in somewhat less than nine years you may come in
sight of the great lake Meona, I mean Meotides, which is little more than
a hundred days’ journey this side of your highness’s kingdom.”

“Your worship is mistaken, señor,” said she; “for it is not two years
since I set out from it, and though I never had good weather, nevertheless
I am here to behold what I so longed for, and that is my lord Don Quixote
of La Mancha, whose fame came to my ears as soon as I set foot in Spain
and impelled me to go in search of him, to commend myself to his courtesy,
and entrust the justice of my cause to the might of his invincible arm.”
</p>
<p>
“Enough; no more praise,” said Don Quixote at this, “for I hate all
flattery; and though this may not be so, still language of the kind is
offensive to my chaste ears. I will only say, señora, that whether it has
might or not, that which it may or may not have shall be devoted to your
service even to death; and now, leaving this to its proper season, I would
ask the señor licentiate to tell me what it is that has brought him into
these parts, alone, unattended, and so lightly clad that I am filled with
amazement.”
</p>
<p>
“I will answer that briefly,” replied the curate; “you must know then,
Señor Don Quixote, that Master Nicholas, our friend and barber, and I were
going to Seville to receive some money that a relative of mine who went to
the Indies many years ago had sent me, and not such a small sum but that
it was over sixty thousand pieces of eight, full weight, which is
something; and passing by this place yesterday we were attacked by four
footpads, who stripped us even to our beards, and them they stripped off
so that the barber found it necessary to put on a false one, and even this
young man here”—pointing to Cardenio—“they completely
transformed. But the best of it is, the story goes in the neighbourhood
that those who attacked us belong to a number of galley slaves who, they
say, were set free almost on the very same spot by a man of such valour
that, in spite of the commissary and of the guards, he released the whole
of them; and beyond all doubt he must have been out of his senses, or he
must be as great a scoundrel as they, or some man without heart or
conscience to let the wolf loose among the sheep, the fox among the hens,
the fly among the honey. He has defrauded justice, and opposed his king
and lawful master, for he opposed his just commands; he has, I say, robbed
the galleys of their feet, stirred up the Holy Brotherhood which for many
years past has been quiet, and, lastly, has done a deed by which his soul
may be lost without any gain to his body.” Sancho had told the curate and
the barber of the adventure of the galley slaves, which, so much to his
glory, his master had achieved, and hence the curate in alluding to it
made the most of it to see what would be said or done by Don Quixote; who
changed colour at every word, not daring to say that it was he who had
been the liberator of those worthy people. “These, then,” said the curate,
“were they who robbed us; and God in his mercy pardon him who would not
let them go to the punishment they deserved.”

The curate had hardly ceased speaking, when Sancho said, “In faith, then,
señor licentiate, he who did that deed was my master; and it was not for
want of my telling him beforehand and warning him to mind what he was
about, and that it was a sin to set them at liberty, as they were all on
the march there because they were special scoundrels.”
</p>
<p>
“Blockhead!” said Don Quixote at this, “it is no business or concern of
knights-errant to inquire whether any persons in affliction, in chains, or
oppressed that they may meet on the high roads go that way and suffer as
they do because of their faults or because of their misfortunes. It only
concerns them to aid them as persons in need of help, having regard to
their sufferings and not to their rascalities. I encountered a chaplet or
string of miserable and unfortunate people, and did for them what my sense
of duty demands of me, and as for the rest be that as it may; and whoever
takes objection to it, saving the sacred dignity of the señor licentiate
and his honoured person, I say he knows little about chivalry and lies
like a whoreson villain, and this I will give him to know to the fullest
extent with my sword;” and so saying he settled himself in his stirrups
and pressed down his morion; for the barber’s basin, which according to
him was Mambrino’s helmet, he carried hanging at the saddle-bow until he
could repair the damage done to it by the galley slaves.
</p>
<p>
Dorothea, who was shrewd and sprightly, and by this time thoroughly
understood Don Quixote’s crazy turn, and that all except Sancho Panza were
making game of him, not to be behind the rest said to him, on observing
his irritation, “Sir Knight, remember the boon you have promised me, and
that in accordance with it you must not engage in any other adventure, be
it ever so pressing; calm yourself, for if the licentiate had known that
the galley slaves had been set free by that unconquered arm he would have
stopped his mouth thrice over, or even bitten his tongue three times
before he would have said a word that tended towards disrespect of your
worship.”
</p>
<p>
“That I swear heartily,” said the curate, “and I would have even plucked
off a moustache.”
</p>
<p>
“I will hold my peace, señora,” said Don Quixote, “and I will curb the
natural anger that had arisen in my breast, and will proceed in peace and
quietness until I have fulfilled my promise; but in return for this
consideration I entreat you to tell me, if you have no objection to do so,
what is the nature of your trouble, and how many, who, and what are the
persons of whom I am to require due satisfaction, and on whom I am to take
vengeance on your behalf?”
</p>
<p>
“That I will do with all my heart,” replied Dorothea, “if it will not be
wearisome to you to hear of miseries and misfortunes.”
</p>
<p>
“It will not be wearisome, señora,” said Don Quixote; to which Dorothea
replied, “Well, if that be so, give me your attention.” As soon as she
said this, Cardenio and the barber drew close to her side, eager to hear
what sort of story the quick-witted Dorothea would invent for herself; and
Sancho did the same, for he was as much taken in by her as his master; and
she having settled herself comfortably in the saddle, and with the help of
coughing and other preliminaries taken time to think, began with great
sprightliness of manner in this fashion.
</p>
<p>
“First of all, I would have you know, sirs, that my name is—”
and here she stopped for a moment, for she forgot the name the curate had given
her; but he came to her relief, seeing what her difficulty was, and said,
“It is no wonder, señora, that your highness should be confused and
embarrassed in telling the tale of your misfortunes; for such afflictions often
have the effect of depriving the sufferers of memory, so that they do not even
remember their own names, as is the case now with your ladyship, who has
forgotten that she is called the Princess Micomicona, lawful heiress of the
great kingdom of Micomicon; and with this cue your highness may now recall to
your sorrowful recollection all you may wish to tell us.”
</p>
<p>
“That is the truth,” said the damsel; “but I think from this on I shall
have no need of any prompting, and I shall bring my true story safe into
port, and here it is. The king my father, who was called Tinacrio the
Sapient, was very learned in what they call magic arts, and became aware
by his craft that my mother, who was called Queen Jaramilla, was to die
before he did, and that soon after he too was to depart this life, and I
was to be left an orphan without father or mother. But all this, he
declared, did not so much grieve or distress him as his certain knowledge
that a prodigious giant, the lord of a great island close to our kingdom,
Pandafilando of the Scowl by name—for it is averred that, though his eyes
are properly placed and straight, he always looks askew as if he squinted,
and this he does out of malignity, to strike fear and terror into those he
looks at—that he knew, I say, that this giant on becoming aware of my
orphan condition would overrun my kingdom with a mighty force and strip me
of all, not leaving me even a small village to shelter me; but that I
could avoid all this ruin and misfortune if I were willing to marry him;
however, as far as he could see, he never expected that I would consent to
a marriage so unequal; and he said no more than the truth in this, for it
has never entered my mind to marry that giant, or any other, let him be
ever so great or enormous. My father said, too, that when he was dead, and
I saw Pandafilando about to invade my kingdom, I was not to wait and
attempt to defend myself, for that would be destructive to me, but that I
should leave the kingdom entirely open to him if I wished to avoid the
death and total destruction of my good and loyal vassals, for there would
be no possibility of defending myself against the giant’s devilish power;
and that I should at once with some of my followers set out for Spain,
where I should obtain relief in my distress on finding a certain
knight-errant whose fame by that time would extend over the whole kingdom,
and who would be called, if I remember rightly, Don Azote or Don Gigote.”
</p>
<p>
“‘Don Quixote,’ he must have said, señora,” observed Sancho at this,
“otherwise called the Knight of the Rueful Countenance.”
</p>
<p>
“That is it,” said Dorothea; “he said, moreover, that he would be tall of
stature and lank featured; and that on his right side under the left
shoulder, or thereabouts, he would have a grey mole with hairs like
bristles.”
</p>
<p>
On hearing this, Don Quixote said to his squire, “Here, Sancho my son,
bear a hand and help me to strip, for I want to see if I am the knight
that sage king foretold.”
</p>
<p>
“What does your worship want to strip for?” said Dorothea.
</p>
<p>
“To see if I have that mole your father spoke of,” answered Don Quixote.
</p>
<p>
“There is no occasion to strip,” said Sancho; “for I know your worship has
just such a mole on the middle of your backbone, which is the mark of a
strong man.”
</p>
<p>
“That is enough,” said Dorothea, “for with friends we must not look too
closely into trifles; and whether it be on the shoulder or on the backbone
matters little; it is enough if there is a mole, be it where it may, for
it is all the same flesh; no doubt my good father hit the truth in every
particular, and I have made a lucky hit in commending myself to Don
Quixote; for he is the one my father spoke of, as the features of his
countenance correspond with those assigned to this knight by that wide
fame he has acquired not only in Spain but in all La Mancha; for I had
scarcely landed at Osuna when I heard such accounts of his achievements,
that at once my heart told me he was the very one I had come in search
of.”
</p>
<p>
“But how did you land at Osuna, señora,” asked Don Quixote, “when it is
not a seaport?”
</p>
<p>
But before Dorothea could reply the curate anticipated her, saying, “The
princess meant to say that after she had landed at Malaga the first place
where she heard of your worship was Osuna.”
</p>
<p>
“That is what I meant to say,” said Dorothea.
</p>
<p>
“And that would be only natural,” said the curate. “Will your majesty
please proceed?”
</p>
<p>
“There is no more to add,” said Dorothea, “save that in finding Don
Quixote I have had such good fortune, that I already reckon and regard
myself queen and mistress of my entire dominions, since of his courtesy
and magnanimity he has granted me the boon of accompanying me
whithersoever I may conduct him, which will be only to bring him face to
face with Pandafilando of the Scowl, that he may slay him and restore to
me what has been unjustly usurped by him: for all this must come to pass
satisfactorily since my good father Tinacrio the Sapient foretold it, who
likewise left it declared in writing in Chaldee or Greek characters (for I
cannot read them), that if this predicted knight, after having cut the
giant’s throat, should be disposed to marry me I was to offer myself at
once without demur as his lawful wife, and yield him possession of my
kingdom together with my person.”
</p>
<p>
“What thinkest thou now, friend Sancho?” said Don Quixote at this.
“Hearest thou that? Did I not tell thee so? See how we have already got a
kingdom to govern and a queen to marry!”
</p>
<p>
“On my oath it is so,” said Sancho; “and foul fortune to him who won’t
marry after slitting Señor Pandahilado’s windpipe! And then, how
illfavoured the queen is! I wish the fleas in my bed were that sort!”
</p>
<p>
And so saying he cut a couple of capers in the air with every sign of
extreme satisfaction, and then ran to seize the bridle of Dorothea’s mule,
and checking it fell on his knees before her, begging her to give him her
hand to kiss in token of his acknowledgment of her as his queen and
mistress. Which of the bystanders could have helped laughing to see the
madness of the master and the simplicity of the servant? Dorothea
therefore gave her hand, and promised to make him a great lord in her
kingdom, when Heaven should be so good as to permit her to recover and
enjoy it, for which Sancho returned thanks in words that set them all
laughing again.
</p>
<p>
“This, sirs,” continued Dorothea, “is my story; it only remains to tell
you that of all the attendants I took with me from my kingdom I have none
left except this well-bearded squire, for all were drowned in a great
tempest we encountered when in sight of port; and he and I came to land on
a couple of planks as if by a miracle; and indeed the whole course of my
life is a miracle and a mystery as you may have observed; and if I have
been over minute in any respect or not as precise as I ought, let it be
accounted for by what the licentiate said at the beginning of my tale,
that constant and excessive troubles deprive the sufferers of their
memory.”
</p>
<p>
“They shall not deprive me of mine, exalted and worthy princess,”
said Don Quixote, “however great and unexampled those which I shall
endure in your service may be; and here I confirm anew the boon I have promised
you, and I swear to go with you to the end of the world until I find myself in
the presence of your fierce enemy, whose haughty head I trust by the aid of my
arm to cut off with the edge of this—I will not say good sword, thanks to
Gines de Pasamonte who carried away mine”—(this he said between his
teeth, and then continued), “and when it has been cut off and you have
been put in peaceful possession of your realm it shall be left to your own
decision to dispose of your person as may be most pleasing to you; for so long
as my memory is occupied, my will enslaved, and my understanding enthralled by
her—I say no more—it is impossible for me for a moment to
contemplate marriage, even with a Phœnix.”
</p>
<p>
The last words of his master about not wanting to marry were so
disagreeable to Sancho that raising his voice he exclaimed with great
irritation:
</p>
<p>
“By my oath, Señor Don Quixote, you are not in your right senses; for how
can your worship possibly object to marrying such an exalted princess as
this? Do you think Fortune will offer you behind every stone such a piece
of luck as is offered you now? Is my lady Dulcinea fairer, perchance? Not
she; nor half as fair; and I will even go so far as to say she does not
come up to the shoe of this one here. A poor chance I have of getting that
county I am waiting for if your worship goes looking for dainties in the
bottom of the sea. In the devil’s name, marry, marry, and take this
kingdom that comes to hand without any trouble, and when you are king make
me a marquis or governor of a province, and for the rest let the devil
take it all.”
</p>
<p>
Don Quixote, when he heard such blasphemies uttered against his lady
Dulcinea, could not endure it, and lifting his pike, without saying
anything to Sancho or uttering a word, he gave him two such thwacks that
he brought him to the ground; and had it not been that Dorothea cried out
to him to spare him he would have no doubt taken his life on the spot.
</p>
<p>
“Do you think,” he said to him after a pause, “you scurvy clown, that you
are to be always interfering with me, and that you are to be always
offending and I always pardoning? Don’t fancy it, impious scoundrel, for
that beyond a doubt thou art, since thou hast set thy tongue going against
the peerless Dulcinea. Know you not, lout, vagabond, beggar, that were it
not for the might that she infuses into my arm I should not have strength
enough to kill a flea? Say, scoffer with a viper’s tongue, what think you
has won this kingdom and cut off this giant’s head and made you a marquis
(for all this I count as already accomplished and decided), but the might
of Dulcinea, employing my arm as the instrument of her achievements? She
fights in me and conquers in me, and I live and breathe in her, and owe my
life and being to her. O whoreson scoundrel, how ungrateful you are, you
see yourself raised from the dust of the earth to be a titled lord, and
the return you make for so great a benefit is to speak evil of her who has
conferred it upon you!”
</p>
<p>
Sancho was not so stunned but that he heard all his master said, and
rising with some degree of nimbleness he ran to place himself behind
Dorothea’s palfrey, and from that position he said to his master:
</p>
<p>
“Tell me, señor; if your worship is resolved not to marry this great
princess, it is plain the kingdom will not be yours; and not being so, how
can you bestow favours upon me? That is what I complain of. Let your
worship at any rate marry this queen, now that we have got her here as if
showered down from heaven, and afterwards you may go back to my lady
Dulcinea; for there must have been kings in the world who kept mistresses.
As to beauty, I have nothing to do with it; and if the truth is to be
told, I like them both; though I have never seen the lady Dulcinea.”
</p>
<p>
“How! never seen her, blasphemous traitor!” exclaimed Don Quixote; “hast
thou not just now brought me a message from her?”
</p>
<p>
“I mean,” said Sancho, “that I did not see her so much at my leisure that
I could take particular notice of her beauty, or of her charms piecemeal;
but taken in the lump I like her.”
</p>
<p>
“Now I forgive thee,” said Don Quixote; “and do thou forgive me the injury
I have done thee; for our first impulses are not in our control.”
</p>
<p>
“That I see,” replied Sancho, “and with me the wish to speak is always the
first impulse, and I cannot help saying, once at any rate, what I have on
the tip of my tongue.”
</p>
<p>
“For all that, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “take heed of what thou sayest,
for the pitcher goes so often to the well—I need say no more to thee.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, well,” said Sancho, “God is in heaven, and sees all tricks, and
will judge who does most harm, I in not speaking right, or your worship in
not doing it.”
</p>
<p>
“That is enough,” said Dorothea; “run, Sancho, and kiss your lord’s hand
and beg his pardon, and henceforward be more circumspect with your praise
and abuse; and say nothing in disparagement of that lady Toboso, of whom I
know nothing save that I am her servant; and put your trust in God, for
you will not fail to obtain some dignity so as to live like a prince.”
</p>
<p>
Sancho advanced hanging his head and begged his master’s hand, which Don
Quixote with dignity presented to him, giving him his blessing as soon as
he had kissed it; he then bade him go on ahead a little, as he had
questions to ask him and matters of great importance to discuss with him.
Sancho obeyed, and when the two had gone some distance in advance Don
Quixote said to him, “Since thy return I have had no opportunity or time
to ask thee many particulars touching thy mission and the answer thou hast
brought back, and now that chance has granted us the time and opportunity,
deny me not the happiness thou canst give me by such good news.”
</p>
<p>
“Let your worship ask what you will,” answered Sancho, “for I shall find a
way out of all as I found a way in; but I implore you, señor, not
to be so revengeful in future.”
</p>
<p>
“Why dost thou say that, Sancho?” said Don Quixote.
</p>
<p>
“I say it,” he returned, “because those blows just now were more because
of the quarrel the devil stirred up between us both the other night, than
for what I said against my lady Dulcinea, whom I love and reverence as I
would a relic—though there is nothing of that about her—merely as
something belonging to your worship.”
</p>
<p>
“Say no more on that subject for thy life, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “for
it is displeasing to me; I have already pardoned thee for that, and thou
knowest the common saying, ‘for a fresh sin a fresh penance.’”
</p>
<p>
While this was going on they saw coming along the road they were following
a man mounted on an ass, who when he came close seemed to be a gipsy; but
Sancho Panza, whose eyes and heart were there wherever he saw asses, no
sooner beheld the man than he knew him to be Gines de Pasamonte; and by
the thread of the gipsy he got at the ball, his ass, for it was, in fact,
Dapple that carried Pasamonte, who to escape recognition and to sell the
ass had disguised himself as a gipsy, being able to speak the gipsy
language, and many more, as well as if they were his own. Sancho saw him
and recognised him, and the instant he did so he shouted to him,
“Ginesillo, you thief, give up my treasure, release my life, embarrass
thyself not with my repose, quit my ass, leave my delight, be off, rip,
get thee gone, thief, and give up what is not thine.”
</p>
<p>
There was no necessity for so many words or objurgations, for at the first
one Gines jumped down, and at a like racing speed made off and got clear
of them all. Sancho hastened to his Dapple, and embracing him he said,
“How hast thou fared, my blessing, Dapple of my eyes, my comrade?” all the
while kissing him and caressing him as if he were a human being. The ass
held his peace, and let himself be kissed and caressed by Sancho without
answering a single word. They all came up and congratulated him on having
found Dapple, Don Quixote especially, who told him that notwithstanding
this he would not cancel the order for the three ass-colts, for which
Sancho thanked him.
</p>
<p>
While the two had been going along conversing in this fashion, the curate
observed to Dorothea that she had shown great cleverness, as well in the
story itself as in its conciseness, and the resemblance it bore to those
of the books of chivalry. She said that she had many times amused herself
reading them; but that she did not know the situation of the provinces or
seaports, and so she had said at haphazard that she had landed at Osuna.
</p>
<p>
“So I saw,” said the curate, “and for that reason I made haste to say what
I did, by which it was all set right. But is it not a strange thing to see
how readily this unhappy gentleman believes all these figments and lies,
simply because they are in the style and manner of the absurdities of his
books?”
</p>
<p>
“So it is,” said Cardenio; “and so uncommon and unexampled, that were one
to attempt to invent and concoct it in fiction, I doubt if there be any
wit keen enough to imagine it.”
</p>
<p>
“But another strange thing about it,” said the curate, “is that, apart
from the silly things which this worthy gentleman says in connection with
his craze, when other subjects are dealt with, he can discuss them in a
perfectly rational manner, showing that his mind is quite clear and
composed; so that, provided his chivalry is not touched upon, no one would
take him to be anything but a man of thoroughly sound understanding.”
</p>
<p>
While they were holding this conversation Don Quixote continued his with
Sancho, saying:
</p>
<p>
“Friend Panza, let us forgive and forget as to our quarrels, and tell me
now, dismissing anger and irritation, where, how, and when didst thou find
Dulcinea? What was she doing? What didst thou say to her? What did she
answer? How did she look when she was reading my letter? Who copied it out
for thee? and everything in the matter that seems to thee worth knowing,
asking, and learning; neither adding nor falsifying to give me pleasure,
nor yet curtailing lest you should deprive me of it.”
</p>
<p>
“Señor,” replied Sancho, “if the truth is to be told, nobody copied out
the letter for me, for I carried no letter at all.”
</p>
<p>
“It is as thou sayest,” said Don Quixote, “for the notebook in which I
wrote it I found in my own possession two days after thy departure, which
gave me very great vexation, as I knew not what thou wouldst do on finding
thyself without any letter; and I made sure thou wouldst return from the
place where thou didst first miss it.”
</p>
<p>
“So I should have done,” said Sancho, “if I had not got it by heart when
your worship read it to me, so that I repeated it to a sacristan, who
copied it out for me from hearing it, so exactly that he said in all the
days of his life, though he had read many a letter of excommunication, he
had never seen or read so pretty a letter as that.”
</p>
<p>
“And hast thou got it still in thy memory, Sancho?” said Don Quixote.
</p>
<p>
“No, señor,” replied Sancho, “for as soon as I had repeated
it, seeing there was no further use for it, I set about forgetting it; and if I
recollect any of it, it is that about ‘Scrubbing,’ I mean to say
‘Sovereign Lady,’ and the end ‘Yours till death, the Knight
of the Rueful Countenance;’ and between these two I put into it more than
three hundred ‘my souls’ and ‘my life’s’ and
‘my eyes.”

“All that is not unsatisfactory to me,” said Don Quixote. “Go on; thou
didst reach her; and what was that queen of beauty doing? Surely thou
didst find her stringing pearls, or embroidering some device in gold
thread for this her enslaved knight.”
</p>
<p>
“I did not,” said Sancho, “but I found her winnowing two bushels of wheat
in the yard of her house.”
</p>
<p>
“Then depend upon it,” said Don Quixote, “the grains of that wheat were
pearls when touched by her hands; and didst thou look, friend? was it
white wheat or brown?”
</p>
<p>
“It was neither, but red,” said Sancho.
</p>
<p>
“Then I promise thee,” said Don Quixote, “that, winnowed by her hands,
beyond a doubt the bread it made was of the whitest; but go on; when thou
gavest her my letter, did she kiss it? Did she place it on her head? Did
she perform any ceremony befitting it, or what did she do?”
</p>
<p>
“When I went to give it to her,” replied Sancho, “she was hard at it
swaying from side to side with a lot of wheat she had in the sieve, and
she said to me, ‘Lay the letter, friend, on the top of that sack, for I
cannot read it until I have done sifting all this.”
</p>
<p>
“Discreet lady!” said Don Quixote; “that was in order to read it at her
leisure and enjoy it; proceed, Sancho; while she was engaged in her
occupation what converse did she hold with thee? What did she ask about
me, and what answer didst thou give? Make haste; tell me all, and let not
an atom be left behind in the ink-bottle.”
</p>
<p>
“She asked me nothing,” said Sancho; “but I told her how your worship was
left doing penance in her service, naked from the waist up, in among these
mountains like a savage, sleeping on the ground, not eating bread off a
tablecloth nor combing your beard, weeping and cursing your fortune.”
</p>
<p>
“In saying I cursed my fortune thou saidst wrong,” said Don Quixote; “for
rather do I bless it and shall bless it all the days of my life for having
made me worthy of aspiring to love so lofty a lady as Dulcinea del
Toboso.”
</p>
<p>
“And so lofty she is,” said Sancho, “that she overtops me by more than a
hand’s-breadth.”
</p>
<p>
“What! Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “didst thou measure with her?”
</p>
<p>
“I measured in this way,” said Sancho; “going to help her to put a sack of
wheat on the back of an ass, we came so close together that I could see
she stood more than a good palm over me.”
</p>
<p>
“Well!” said Don Quixote, “and doth she not of a truth accompany and adorn
this greatness with a thousand million charms of mind! But one thing thou
wilt not deny, Sancho; when thou camest close to her didst thou not
perceive a Sabæan odour, an aromatic fragrance, a, I know not what,
delicious, that I cannot find a name for; I mean a redolence, an
exhalation, as if thou wert in the shop of some dainty glover?”
</p>
<p>
“All I can say is,” said Sancho, “that I did perceive a little odour,
something goaty; it must have been that she was all in a sweat with hard
work.”
</p>
<p>
“It could not be that,” said Don Quixote, “but thou must have been
suffering from cold in the head, or must have smelt thyself; for I know
well what would be the scent of that rose among thorns, that lily of the
field, that dissolved amber.”
</p>
<p>
“Maybe so,” replied Sancho; “there often comes from myself that same odour
which then seemed to me to come from her grace the lady Dulcinea; but
that’s no wonder, for one devil is like another.”
</p>
<p>
“Well then,” continued Don Quixote, “now she has done sifting the corn and
sent it to the mill; what did she do when she read the letter?”
</p>
<p>
“As for the letter,” said Sancho, “she did not read it, for she said she
could neither read nor write; instead of that she tore it up into small
pieces, saying that she did not want to let anyone read it lest her
secrets should become known in the village, and that what I had told her
by word of mouth about the love your worship bore her, and the
extraordinary penance you were doing for her sake, was enough; and, to
make an end of it, she told me to tell your worship that she kissed your
hands, and that she had a greater desire to see you than to write to you;
and that therefore she entreated and commanded you, on sight of this
present, to come out of these thickets, and to have done with carrying on
absurdities, and to set out at once for El Toboso, unless something else
of greater importance should happen, for she had a great desire to see
your worship. She laughed greatly when I told her how your worship was
called The Knight of the Rueful Countenance; I asked her if that Biscayan
the other day had been there; and she told me he had, and that he was an
honest fellow; I asked her too about the galley slaves, but she said she
had not seen any as yet.”
</p>
<p>
“So far all goes well,” said Don Quixote; “but tell me what
jewel was it that she gave thee on taking thy leave, in return for thy tidings
of me? For it is a usual and ancient custom with knights and ladies errant to
give the squires, damsels, or dwarfs who bring tidings of their ladies to the
knights, or of their knights to the ladies, some rich jewel as a guerdon for
good news, and acknowledgment of the message.”
</p>
<p>
“That is very likely,” said Sancho, “and a good custom it was, to my mind;
but that must have been in days gone by, for now it would seem to be the
custom only to give a piece of bread and cheese; because that was what my
lady Dulcinea gave me over the top of the yard-wall when I took leave of
her; and more by token it was sheep’s-milk cheese.”
</p>
<p>
“She is generous in the extreme,” said Don Quixote, “and if she did not
give thee a jewel of gold, no doubt it must have been because she had not
one to hand there to give thee; but sleeves are good after Easter; I shall
see her and all shall be made right. But knowest thou what amazes me,
Sancho? It seems to me thou must have gone and come through the air, for
thou hast taken but little more than three days to go to El Toboso and
return, though it is more than thirty leagues from here to there. From
which I am inclined to think that the sage magician who is my friend, and
watches over my interests (for of necessity there is and must be one, or
else I should not be a right knight-errant), that this same, I say, must
have helped thee to travel without thy knowledge; for some of these sages
will catch up a knight-errant sleeping in his bed, and without his knowing
how or in what way it happened, he wakes up the next day more than a
thousand leagues away from the place where he went to sleep. And if it
were not for this, knights-errant would not be able to give aid to one
another in peril, as they do at every turn. For a knight, maybe, is
fighting in the mountains of Armenia with some dragon, or fierce serpent,
or another knight, and gets the worst of the battle, and is at the point
of death; but when he least looks for it, there appears over against him
on a cloud, or chariot of fire, another knight, a friend of his, who just
before had been in England, and who takes his part, and delivers him from
death; and at night he finds himself in his own quarters supping very much
to his satisfaction; and yet from one place to the other will have been
two or three thousand leagues. And all this is done by the craft and skill
of the sage enchanters who take care of those valiant knights; so that,
friend Sancho, I find no difficulty in believing that thou mayest have
gone from this place to El Toboso and returned in such a short time,
since, as I have said, some friendly sage must have carried thee through
the air without thee perceiving it.”
</p>
<p>
“That must have been it,” said Sancho, “for indeed Rocinante went like a
gipsy’s ass with quicksilver in his ears.”
</p>
<p>
“Quicksilver!” said Don Quixote, “aye and what is more, a legion of
devils, folk that can travel and make others travel without being weary,
exactly as the whim seizes them. But putting this aside, what thinkest
thou I ought to do about my lady’s command to go and see her? For though I
feel that I am bound to obey her mandate, I feel too that I am debarred by
the boon I have accorded to the princess that accompanies us, and the law
of chivalry compels me to have regard for my word in preference to my
inclination; on the one hand the desire to see my lady pursues and
harasses me, on the other my solemn promise and the glory I shall win in
this enterprise urge and call me; but what I think I shall do is to travel
with all speed and reach quickly the place where this giant is, and on my
arrival I shall cut off his head, and establish the princess peacefully in
her realm, and forthwith I shall return to behold the light that lightens
my senses, to whom I shall make such excuses that she will be led to
approve of my delay, for she will see that it entirely tends to increase
her glory and fame; for all that I have won, am winning, or shall win by
arms in this life, comes to me of the favour she extends to me, and
because I am hers.”
</p>
<p>
“Ah! what a sad state your worship’s brains are in!” said Sancho. “Tell
me, señor, do you mean to travel all that way for nothing, and to let slip
and lose so rich and great a match as this where they give as a portion a
kingdom that in sober truth I have heard say is more than twenty thousand
leagues round about, and abounds with all things necessary to support
human life, and is bigger than Portugal and Castile put together? Peace,
for the love of God! Blush for what you have said, and take my advice, and
forgive me, and marry at once in the first village where there is a
curate; if not, here is our licentiate who will do the business
beautifully; remember, I am old enough to give advice, and this I am
giving comes pat to the purpose; for a sparrow in the hand is better than
a vulture on the wing, and he who has the good to his hand and chooses the
bad, that the good he complains of may not come to him.”
</p>
<p>
“Look here, Sancho,” said Don Quixote. “If thou art advising me to marry,
in order that immediately on slaying the giant I may become king, and be
able to confer favours on thee, and give thee what I have promised, let me
tell thee I shall be able very easily to satisfy thy desires without
marrying; for before going into battle I will make it a stipulation that,
if I come out of it victorious, even I do not marry, they shall give me a
portion of the kingdom, that I may bestow it upon whomsoever I
choose, and when they give it to me upon whom wouldst thou have me bestow
it but upon thee?”
</p>
<p>
“That is plain speaking,” said Sancho; “but let your worship take care to
choose it on the seacoast, so that if I don’t like the life, I may be able
to ship off my black vassals and deal with them as I have said; don’t mind
going to see my lady Dulcinea now, but go and kill this giant and let us
finish off this business; for by God it strikes me it will be one of great
honour and great profit.”
</p>
<p>
“I hold thou art in the right of it, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “and I
will take thy advice as to accompanying the princess before going to see
Dulcinea; but I counsel thee not to say anything to anyone, or to those
who are with us, about what we have considered and discussed, for as
Dulcinea is so decorous that she does not wish her thoughts to be known it
is not right that I or anyone for me should disclose them.”
</p>
<p>
“Well then, if that be so,” said Sancho, “how is it that your worship
makes all those you overcome by your arm go to present themselves before
my lady Dulcinea, this being the same thing as signing your name to it
that you love her and are her lover? And as those who go must perforce
kneel before her and say they come from your worship to submit themselves
to her, how can the thoughts of both of you be hid?”
</p>
<p>
“O, how silly and simple thou art!” said Don Quixote; “seest thou not,
Sancho, that this tends to her greater exaltation? For thou must know that
according to our way of thinking in chivalry, it is a high honour to a
lady to have many knights-errant in her service, whose thoughts never go
beyond serving her for her own sake, and who look for no other reward for
their great and true devotion than that she should be willing to accept
them as her knights.”
</p>
<p>
“It is with that kind of love,” said Sancho, “I have heard preachers say
we ought to love our Lord, for himself alone, without being moved by the
hope of glory or the fear of punishment; though for my part, I would
rather love and serve him for what he could do.”
</p>
<p>
“The devil take thee for a clown!” said Don Quixote, “and what shrewd
things thou sayest at times! One would think thou hadst studied.”
</p>
<p>
“In faith, then, I cannot even read.”
</p>
<p>
Master Nicholas here called out to them to wait a while, as they wanted to
halt and drink at a little spring there was there. Don Quixote drew up,
not a little to the satisfaction of Sancho, for he was by this time weary
of telling so many lies, and in dread of his master catching him tripping,
for though he knew that Dulcinea was a peasant girl of El Toboso, he had
never seen her in all his life. Cardenio had now put on the clothes which
Dorothea was wearing when they found her, and though they were not very
good, they were far better than those he put off. They dismounted together
by the side of the spring, and with what the curate had provided himself
with at the inn they appeased, though not very well, the keen appetite
they all of them brought with them.
</p>
<p>
While they were so employed there happened to come by a youth passing on
his way, who stopping to examine the party at the spring, the next moment
ran to Don Quixote and clasping him round the legs, began to weep freely,
saying, “O, señor, do you not know me? Look at me well; I am that lad
Andres that your worship released from the oak-tree where I was tied.”
</p>
<p>
Don Quixote recognised him, and taking his hand he turned to those present
and said: “That your worships may see how important it is to have
knights-errant to redress the wrongs and injuries done by tyrannical and
wicked men in this world, I may tell you that some days ago passing
through a wood, I heard cries and piteous complaints as of a person in
pain and distress; I immediately hastened, impelled by my bounden duty, to
the quarter whence the plaintive accents seemed to me to proceed, and I
found tied to an oak this lad who now stands before you, which in my heart
I rejoice at, for his testimony will not permit me to depart from the
truth in any particular. He was, I say, tied to an oak, naked from the
waist up, and a clown, whom I afterwards found to be his master, was
scarifying him by lashes with the reins of his mare. As soon as I saw him
I asked the reason of so cruel a flagellation. The boor replied that he
was flogging him because he was his servant and because of carelessness
that proceeded rather from dishonesty than stupidity; on which this boy
said, ‘Señor, he flogs me only because I ask for my wages.’ The master
made I know not what speeches and explanations, which, though I listened
to them, I did not accept. In short, I compelled the clown to unbind him,
and to swear he would take him with him, and pay him real by real, and
perfumed into the bargain. Is not all this true, Andres my son? Didst thou
not mark with what authority I commanded him, and with what humility he
promised to do all I enjoined, specified, and required of him? Answer
without hesitation; tell these gentlemen what took place, that they may
see that it is as great an advantage as I say to have knights-errant
abroad.”
</p>
<p>
“All that your worship has said is quite true,” answered the lad; “but the
end of the business turned out just the opposite of what your worship
supposes.”
</p>
<p>
“How! the opposite?” said Don Quixote; “did not the clown pay thee then?”
</p>
<p>
“Not only did he not pay me,” replied the lad, “but as soon as your
worship had passed out of the wood and we were alone, he tied me up again
to the same oak and gave me a fresh flogging, that left me like a flayed
Saint Bartholomew; and every stroke he gave me he followed up with some
jest or gibe about having made a fool of your worship, and but for the
pain I was suffering I should have laughed at the things he said. In short
he left me in such a condition that I have been until now in a hospital
getting cured of the injuries which that rascally clown inflicted on me
then; for all which your worship is to blame; for if you had gone your own
way and not come where there was no call for you, nor meddled in other
people’s affairs, my master would have been content with giving me one or
two dozen lashes, and would have then loosed me and paid me what he owed
me; but when your worship abused him so out of measure, and gave him so
many hard words, his anger was kindled; and as he could not revenge
himself on you, as soon as he saw you had left him the storm burst upon me
in such a way, that I feel as if I should never be a man again.”
</p>
<p>
“The mischief,” said Don Quixote, “lay in my going away; for I should not
have gone until I had seen thee paid; because I ought to have known well
by long experience that there is no clown who will keep his word if he
finds it will not suit him to keep it; but thou rememberest, Andres, that
I swore if he did not pay thee I would go and seek him, and find him
though he were to hide himself in the whale’s belly.”
</p>
<p>
“That is true,” said Andres; “but it was of no use.”
</p>
<p>
“Thou shalt see now whether it is of use or not,” said Don Quixote; and so
saying, he got up hastily and bade Sancho bridle Rocinante, who was
browsing while they were eating. Dorothea asked him what he meant to do.
He replied that he meant to go in search of this clown and chastise him
for such iniquitous conduct, and see Andres paid to the last maravedi,
despite and in the teeth of all the clowns in the world. To which she
replied that he must remember that in accordance with his promise he could
not engage in any enterprise until he had concluded hers; and that as he
knew this better than anyone, he should restrain his ardour until his
return from her kingdom.
</p>
<p>
“That is true,” said Don Quixote, “and Andres must have patience until my
return as you say, señora; but I once more swear and promise not to stop
until I have seen him avenged and paid.”
</p>
<p>
“I have no faith in those oaths,” said Andres; “I would rather have now
something to help me to get to Seville than all the revenges in the world;
if you have here anything to eat that I can take with me, give it me, and
God be with your worship and all knights-errant; and may their errands
turn out as well for themselves as they have for me.”
</p>
<p>
Sancho took out from his store a piece of bread and another of cheese, and
giving them to the lad he said, “Here, take this, brother Andres, for we
have all of us a share in your misfortune.”
</p>
<p>
“Why, what share have you got?”
</p>
<p>
“This share of bread and cheese I am giving you,” answered Sancho; “and
God knows whether I shall feel the want of it myself or not; for I would
have you know, friend, that we squires to knights-errant have to bear a
great deal of hunger and hard fortune, and even other things more easily
felt than told.”
</p>
<p>
Andres seized his bread and cheese, and seeing that nobody gave him
anything more, bent his head, and took hold of the road, as the saying is.
However, before leaving he said, “For the love of God, sir knight-errant,
if you ever meet me again, though you may see them cutting me to pieces,
give me no aid or succour, but leave me to my misfortune, which will not
be so great but that a greater will come to me by being helped by your
worship, on whom and all the knights-errant that have ever been born God
send his curse.”
</p>
<p>
Don Quixote was getting up to chastise him, but he took to his heels at
such a pace that no one attempted to follow him; and mightily chapfallen
was Don Quixote at Andres’ story, and the others had to take great care to
restrain their laughter so as not to put him entirely out of countenance.

<p>
Their dainty repast being finished, they saddled at once, and without any
adventure worth mentioning they reached next day the inn, the object of
Sancho Panza’s fear and dread; but though he would have rather not entered
it, there was no help for it. The landlady, the landlord, their daughter,
and Maritornes, when they saw Don Quixote and Sancho coming, went out to
welcome them with signs of hearty satisfaction, which Don Quixote received
with dignity and gravity, and bade them make up a better bed for him than
the last time: to which the landlady replied that if he paid better than
he did the last time she would give him one fit for a prince. Don Quixote
said he would, so they made up a tolerable one for him in the same garret
as before; and he lay down at once, being sorely shaken and in want of
sleep.
</p>
<p>
No sooner was the door shut upon him than the landlady made at the barber,
and seizing him by the beard, said:
</p>
<p>
“By my faith you are not going to make a beard of my tail any longer; you
must give me back my tail, for it is a shame the way that thing of my
husband’s goes tossing about on the floor; I mean the comb that I used to
stick in my good tail.”
</p>
<p>
But for all she tugged at it the barber would not give it up until the
licentiate told him to let her have it, as there was now no further occasion
for that stratagem, because he might declare himself and appear in his own
character, and tell Don Quixote that he had fled to this inn when those thieves
the galley slaves robbed him; and should he ask for the princess’s
squire, they could tell him that she had sent him on before her to give notice
to the people of her kingdom that she was coming, and bringing with her the
deliverer of them all. On this the barber cheerfully restored the tail to the
landlady, and at the same time they returned all the accessories they had
borrowed to effect Don Quixote’s deliverance. All the people of the inn
were struck with astonishment at the beauty of Dorothea, and even at the comely
figure of the shepherd Cardenio. The curate made them get ready such fare as
there was in the inn, and the landlord, in hope of better payment, served them
up a tolerably good dinner. All this time Don Quixote was asleep, and they
thought it best not to waken him, as sleeping would now do him more good than
eating.
</p>
<p>
While at dinner, the company consisting of the landlord, his wife, their
daughter, Maritornes, and all the travellers, they discussed the strange
craze of Don Quixote and the manner in which he had been found; and the
landlady told them what had taken place between him and the carrier; and
then, looking round to see if Sancho was there, when she saw he was not,
she gave them the whole story of his blanketing, which they received with
no little amusement. But on the curate observing that it was the books of
chivalry which Don Quixote had read that had turned his brain, the
landlord said:
</p>
<p>
“I cannot understand how that can be, for in truth to my mind there is no
better reading in the world, and I have here two or three of them, with
other writings that are the very life, not only of myself but of plenty
more; for when it is harvest-time, the reapers flock here on holidays, and
there is always one among them who can read and who takes up one of these
books, and we gather round him, thirty or more of us, and stay listening
to him with a delight that makes our grey hairs grow young again. At least
I can say for myself that when I hear of what furious and terrible blows
the knights deliver, I am seized with the longing to do the same, and I
would like to be hearing about them night and day.”
</p>
<p>
“And I just as much,” said the landlady, “because I never have a quiet
moment in my house except when you are listening to someone reading; for
then you are so taken up that for the time being you forget to scold.”
</p>
<p>
“That is true,” said Maritornes; “and, faith, I relish hearing these
things greatly too, for they are very pretty; especially when they
describe some lady or another in the arms of her knight under the orange
trees, and the duenna who is keeping watch for them half dead with envy
and fright; all this I say is as good as honey.”
</p>
<p>
“And you, what do you think, young lady?” said the curate turning to the
landlord’s daughter.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know indeed, señor,” said she; “I listen too, and to tell the
truth, though I do not understand it, I like hearing it; but it is not the
blows that my father likes that I like, but the laments the knights utter
when they are separated from their ladies; and indeed they sometimes make
me weep with the pity I feel for them.”
</p>
<p>
“Then you would console them if it was for you they wept, young lady?”
said Dorothea.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know what I should do,” said the girl; “I only know that there
are some of those ladies so cruel that they call their knights tigers and
lions and a thousand other foul names: and Jesus! I don’t know what sort
of folk they can be, so unfeeling and heartless, that rather than bestow a
glance upon a worthy man they leave him to die or go mad. I don’t know
what is the good of such prudery; if it is for honour’s sake, why not
marry them? That’s all they want.”
</p>
<p>
“Hush, child,” said the landlady; “it seems to me thou knowest a great
deal about these things, and it is not fit for girls to know or talk so
much.”
</p>
<p>
“As the gentleman asked me, I could not help answering him,” said the
girl.
</p>
<p>
“Well then,” said the curate, “bring me these books, señor landlord, for I
should like to see them.”
</p>
<p>
“With all my heart,” said he, and going into his own room he brought out
an old valise secured with a little chain, on opening which the curate
found in it three large books and some manuscripts written in a very good
hand. The first that he opened he found to be “Don Cirongilio of Thrace,”
and the second “Don Felixmarte of Hircania,” and the other the “History of
the Great Captain Gonzalo Hernandez de Cordova, with the Life of Diego
García de Paredes.”
</p>
<p>
When the curate read the two first titles he looked over at the barber and
said, “We want my friend’s housekeeper and niece here now.”
</p>
<p>
“Nay,” said the barber, “I can do just as well to carry them to the yard
or to the hearth, and there is a very good fire there.”
</p>
<p>
“What! your worship would burn my books!” said the landlord.
</p>
<p>
“Only these two,” said the curate, “Don Cirongilio, and Felixmarte.”
</p>
<p>
“Are my books, then, heretics or phlegmatics that you want to burn
them?” said the landlord.
</p>
<p>
“Schismatics you mean, friend,” said the barber, “not phlegmatics.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s it,” said the landlord; “but if you want to burn any, let it be
that about the Great Captain and that Diego García; for I would rather
have a child of mine burnt than either of the others.”
</p>
<p>
“Brother,” said the curate, “those two books are made up of lies, and are
full of folly and nonsense; but this of the Great Captain is a true
history, and contains the deeds of Gonzalo Hernandez of Cordova, who by
his many and great achievements earned the title all over the world of the
Great Captain, a famous and illustrious name, and deserved by him alone;
and this Diego García de Paredes was a distinguished knight of the city of
Trujillo in Estremadura, a most gallant soldier, and of such bodily
strength that with one finger he stopped a mill-wheel in full motion; and
posted with a two-handed sword at the foot of a bridge he kept the whole
of an immense army from passing over it, and achieved such other exploits
that if, instead of his relating them himself with the modesty of a knight
and of one writing his own history, some free and unbiased writer had
recorded them, they would have thrown into the shade all the deeds of the
Hectors, Achilleses, and Rolands.”

</p>
<p>
“Tell that to my father,” said the landlord. “There’s a thing to be
astonished at! Stopping a mill-wheel! By God your worship should read what
I have read of Felixmarte of Hircania, how with one single backstroke he
cleft five giants asunder through the middle as if they had been made of
bean-pods like the little friars the children make; and another time he
attacked a very great and powerful army, in which there were more than a
million six hundred thousand soldiers, all armed from head to foot, and he
routed them all as if they had been flocks of sheep.”

<p>
“And then, what do you say to the good Cirongilio of Thrace, that was so
stout and bold; as may be seen in the book, where it is related that as he
was sailing along a river there came up out of the midst of the water
against him a fiery serpent, and he, as soon as he saw it, flung himself
upon it and got astride of its scaly shoulders, and squeezed its throat
with both hands with such force that the serpent, finding he was
throttling it, had nothing for it but to let itself sink to the bottom of
the river, carrying with it the knight who would not let go his hold; and
when they got down there he found himself among palaces and gardens so
pretty that it was a wonder to see; and then the serpent changed itself
into an old ancient man, who told him such things as were never heard.
Hold your peace, señor; for if you were to hear this you would go mad with
delight. A couple of figs for your Great Captain and your Diego García!”
</p>
<p>
Hearing this Dorothea said in a whisper to Cardenio, “Our landlord is
almost fit to play a second part to Don Quixote.”
</p>
<p>
“I think so,” said Cardenio, “for, as he shows, he accepts it as a
certainty that everything those books relate took place exactly as it is
written down; and the barefooted friars themselves would not persuade him
to the contrary.”
</p>
<p>
“But consider, brother,” said the curate once more, “there never was any
Felixmarte of Hircania in the world, nor any Cirongilio of Thrace, or any
of the other knights of the same sort, that the books of chivalry talk of;
the whole thing is the fabrication and invention of idle wits, devised by
them for the purpose you describe of beguiling the time, as your reapers
do when they read; for I swear to you in all seriousness there never were
any such knights in the world, and no such exploits or nonsense ever
happened anywhere.”
</p>
<p>
“Try that bone on another dog,” said the landlord; “as if I did not know
how many make five, and where my shoe pinches me; don’t think to feed me
with pap, for by God I am no fool. It is a good joke for your worship to
try and persuade me that everything these good books say is nonsense and
lies, and they printed by the license of the Lords of the Royal Council,
as if they were people who would allow such a lot of lies to be printed
all together, and so many battles and enchantments that they take away
one’s senses.”
</p>
<p>
“I have told you, friend,” said the curate, “that this is done to divert
our idle thoughts; and as in well-ordered states games of chess, fives,
and billiards are allowed for the diversion of those who do not care, or
are not obliged, or are unable to work, so books of this kind are allowed
to be printed, on the supposition that, what indeed is the truth, there
can be nobody so ignorant as to take any of them for true stories; and if
it were permitted me now, and the present company desired it, I could say
something about the qualities books of chivalry should possess to be good
ones, that would be to the advantage and even to the taste of some; but I
hope the time will come when I can communicate my ideas to someone who
may be able to mend matters; and in the meantime, señor landlord, believe
what I have said, and take your books, and make up your mind about their
truth or falsehood, and much good may they do you; and God grant you may
not fall lame of the same foot your guest Don Quixote halts on.”
</p>
<p>
“No fear of that,” returned the landlord; “I shall not be so mad as to
make a knight-errant of myself; for I see well enough that things are not
now as they used to be in those days, when they say those famous knights
roamed about the world.”
</p>
<p>
Sancho had made his appearance in the middle of this conversation, and he
was very much troubled and cast down by what he heard said about
knights-errant being now no longer in vogue, and all books of chivalry
being folly and lies; and he resolved in his heart to wait and see what
came of this journey of his master’s, and if it did not turn out as
happily as his master expected, he determined to leave him and go back to
his wife and children and his ordinary labour.
</p>
<p>
The landlord was carrying away the valise and the books, but the curate
said to him, “Wait; I want to see what those papers are that are written
in such a good hand.” The landlord taking them out handed them to him to
read, and he perceived they were a work of about eight sheets of
manuscript, with, in large letters at the beginning, the title of “Novel
of the Ill-advised Curiosity.” The curate read three or four lines to
himself, and said, “I must say the title of this novel does not seem to me
a bad one, and I feel an inclination to read it all.” To which the
landlord replied, “Then your reverence will do well to read it, for I can
tell you that some guests who have read it here have been much pleased
with it, and have begged it of me very earnestly; but I would not give it,
meaning to return it to the person who forgot the valise, books, and
papers here, for maybe he will return here some time or other; and though
I know I shall miss the books, faith I mean to return them; for though I
am an innkeeper, still I am a Christian.”
</p>
<p>
“You are very right, friend,” said the curate; “but for all that, if the
novel pleases me you must let me copy it.”
</p>
<p>
“With all my heart,” replied the host.
</p>
<p>
While they were talking Cardenio had taken up the novel and begun to read
it, and forming the same opinion of it as the curate, he begged him to
read it so that they might all hear it.
</p>
<p>
“I would read it,” said the curate, “if the time would not be better spent
in sleeping.”
</p>
<p>
“It will be rest enough for me,” said Dorothea, “to while away the time by
listening to some tale, for my spirits are not yet tranquil enough to let
me sleep when it would be seasonable.”
</p>
<p>
“Well then, in that case,” said the curate, “I will read it, if it were
only out of curiosity; perhaps it may contain something pleasant.”
</p>
<p>
Master Nicholas added his entreaties to the same effect, and Sancho too;
seeing which, and considering that he would give pleasure to all, and
receive it himself, the curate said, “Well then, attend to me everyone,
for the novel begins thus.”

<a id="ch33"></a>CHAPTER XXXIII.<br>
IN WHICH IS RELATED THE NOVEL OF “THE ILL-ADVISED CURIOSITY”
</h3>
<p>
In Florence, a rich and famous city of Italy in the province called
Tuscany, there lived two gentlemen of wealth and quality, Anselmo and
Lothario, such great friends that by way of distinction they were called
by all that knew them “The Two Friends.” They were unmarried, young, of
the same age and of the same tastes, which was enough to account for the
reciprocal friendship between them. Anselmo, it is true, was somewhat more
inclined to seek pleasure in love than Lothario, for whom the pleasures of
the chase had more attraction; but on occasion Anselmo would forego his
own tastes to yield to those of Lothario, and Lothario would surrender his
to fall in with those of Anselmo, and in this way their inclinations kept
pace one with the other with a concord so perfect that the best regulated
clock could not surpass it.
</p>
<p>
Anselmo was deep in love with a high-born and beautiful maiden of the same
city, the daughter of parents so estimable, and so estimable herself, that
he resolved, with the approval of his friend Lothario, without whom he did
nothing, to ask her of them in marriage, and did so, Lothario being the
bearer of the demand, and conducting the negotiation so much to the
satisfaction of his friend that in a short time he was in possession of
the object of his desires, and Camilla so happy in having won Anselmo for
her husband, that she gave thanks unceasingly to heaven and to Lothario,
by whose means such good fortune had fallen to her. The first few days,
those of a wedding being usually days of merry-making, Lothario frequented
his friend Anselmo’s house as he had been wont, striving to do honour to
him and to the occasion, and to gratify him in every way he could; but
when the wedding days were over and the succession of visits and
congratulations had slackened, he began purposely to leave off going to
the house of Anselmo, for it seemed to him, as it naturally would to all
men of sense, that friends’ houses ought not to be visited after marriage
with the same frequency as in their masters’ bachelor days: because,
though true and genuine friendship cannot and should not be in any way
suspicious, still a married man’s honour is a thing of such delicacy that
it is held liable to injury from brothers, much more from friends. Anselmo
remarked the cessation of Lothario’s visits, and complained of it to him,
saying that if he had known that marriage was to keep him from enjoying
his society as he used, he would have never married; and that, if by the
thorough harmony that subsisted between them while he was a bachelor they
had earned such a sweet name as that of “The Two Friends,” he should not
allow a title so rare and so delightful to be lost through a needless
anxiety to act circumspectly; and so he entreated him, if such a phrase
was allowable between them, to be once more master of his house and to
come in and go out as formerly, assuring him that his wife Camilla had no
other desire or inclination than that which he would wish her to have, and
that knowing how sincerely they loved one another she was grieved to see
such coldness in him.
</p>
<p>
To all this and much more that Anselmo said to Lothario to persuade him to
come to his house as he had been in the habit of doing, Lothario replied
with so much prudence, sense, and judgment, that Anselmo was satisfied of
his friend’s good intentions, and it was agreed that on two days in the
week, and on holidays, Lothario should come to dine with him; but though
this arrangement was made between them Lothario resolved to observe it no
further than he considered to be in accordance with the honour of his
friend, whose good name was more to him than his own. He said, and justly,
that a married man upon whom heaven had bestowed a beautiful wife should
consider as carefully what friends he brought to his house as what female
friends his wife associated with, for what cannot be done or arranged in
the market-place, in church, at public festivals or at stations
(opportunities that husbands cannot always deny their wives), may be
easily managed in the house of the female friend or relative in whom most
confidence is reposed. Lothario said, too, that every married man should
have some friend who would point out to him any negligence he might be
guilty of in his conduct, for it will sometimes happen that owing to the
deep affection the husband bears his wife either he does not caution her,
or, not to vex her, refrains from telling her to do or not to do certain
things, doing or avoiding which may be a matter of honour or reproach to
him; and errors of this kind he could easily correct if warned by a
friend. But where is such a friend to be found as Lothario would have, so
judicious, so loyal, and so true?
</p>
<p>
Of a truth I know not; Lothario alone was such a one, for with the utmost
care and vigilance he watched over the honour of his friend, and strove to
diminish, cut down, and reduce the number of days for going to his house
according to their agreement, lest the visits of a young man, wealthy,
high-born, and with the attractions he was conscious of possessing, at the
house of a woman so beautiful as Camilla, should be regarded with
suspicion by the inquisitive and malicious eyes of the idle public. For
though his integrity and reputation might bridle slanderous tongues, still
he was unwilling to hazard either his own good name or that of his friend;
and for this reason most of the days agreed upon he devoted to some other
business which he pretended was unavoidable; so that a great portion of
the day was taken up with complaints on one side and excuses on the other.
It happened, however, that on one occasion when the two were strolling
together outside the city, Anselmo addressed the following words to
Lothario.
</p>
<p>
“Thou mayest suppose, Lothario my friend, that I am unable to give
sufficient thanks for the favours God has rendered me in making me the son
of such parents as mine were, and bestowing upon me with no niggard hand
what are called the gifts of nature as well as those of fortune, and above
all for what he has done in giving me thee for a friend and Camilla for a
wife—two treasures that I value, if not as highly as I ought, at
least as highly as I am able. And yet, with all these good things, which
are commonly all that men need to enable them to live happily, I am the
most discontented and dissatisfied man in the whole world; for, I know not
how long since, I have been harassed and oppressed by a desire so strange
and so unusual, that I wonder at myself and blame and chide myself when I
am alone, and strive to stifle it and hide it from my own thoughts, and
with no better success than if I were endeavouring deliberately to publish
it to all the world; and as, in short, it must come out, I would confide
it to thy safe keeping, feeling sure that by this means, and by thy
readiness as a true friend to afford me relief, I shall soon find myself
freed from the distress it causes me, and that thy care will give me
happiness in the same degree as my own folly has caused me misery.”
</p>
<p>
The words of Anselmo struck Lothario with astonishment, unable as he was
to conjecture the purport of such a lengthy preamble; and though he strove
to imagine what desire it could be that so troubled his friend, his
conjectures were all far from the truth, and to relieve the anxiety which
this perplexity was causing him, he told him he was doing a flagrant
injustice to their great friendship in seeking circuitous methods of
confiding to him his most hidden thoughts, for he well knew he might
reckon upon his counsel in diverting them, or his help in carrying them
into effect.
</p>
<p>
“That is the truth,” replied Anselmo, “and relying upon that I will tell
thee, friend Lothario, that the desire which harasses me is that of
knowing whether my wife Camilla is as good and as perfect as I think her
to be; and I cannot satisfy myself of the truth on this point except by
testing her in such a way that the trial may prove the purity of her
virtue as the fire proves that of gold; because I am persuaded, my friend,
that a woman is virtuous only in proportion as she is or is not tempted;
and that she alone is strong who does not yield to the promises, gifts,
tears, and importunities of earnest lovers; for what thanks does a woman
deserve for being good if no one urges her to be bad, and what wonder is
it that she is reserved and circumspect to whom no opportunity is given of
going wrong and who knows she has a husband that will take her life the
first time he detects her in an impropriety? I do not therefore hold her
who is virtuous through fear or want of opportunity in the same estimation
as her who comes out of temptation and trial with a crown of victory; and
so, for these reasons and many others that I could give thee to justify
and support the opinion I hold, I am desirous that my wife Camilla should
pass this crisis, and be refined and tested by the fire of finding herself
wooed and by one worthy to set his affections upon her; and if she comes
out, as I know she will, victorious from this struggle, I shall look upon
my good fortune as unequalled, I shall be able to say that the cup of my
desire is full, and that the virtuous woman of whom the sage says ‘Who
shall find her?’ has fallen to my lot. And if the result be the contrary
of what I expect, in the satisfaction of knowing that I have been right in
my opinion, I shall bear without complaint the pain which my so dearly
bought experience will naturally cause me. And, as nothing of all thou
wilt urge in opposition to my wish will avail to keep me from carrying it
into effect, it is my desire, friend Lothario, that thou shouldst consent
to become the instrument for effecting this purpose that I am bent upon,
for I will afford thee opportunities to that end, and nothing shall be
wanting that I may think necessary for the pursuit of a virtuous,
honourable, modest and high-minded woman. And among other reasons, I am
induced to entrust this arduous task to thee by the consideration that if
Camilla be conquered by thee the conquest will not be pushed to extremes,
but only far enough to account that accomplished which from a sense of
honour will be left undone; thus I shall not be wronged in anything more
than intention, and my wrong will remain buried in the integrity of thy
silence, which I know well will be as lasting as that of death in what
concerns me. If, therefore, thou wouldst have me enjoy what can be called
life, thou wilt at once engage in this love struggle, not lukewarmly nor
slothfully, but with the energy and zeal that my desire demands, and with
the loyalty our friendship assures me of.”
</p>
<p>
Such were the words Anselmo addressed to Lothario, who listened to them with
such attention that, except to say what has been already mentioned, he did not
open his lips until the other had finished. Then perceiving that he had no more
to say, after regarding him for a while, as one would regard something never
before seen that excited wonder and amazement, he said to him, “I cannot
persuade myself, Anselmo my friend, that what thou hast said to me is not in
jest; if I thought that thou wert speaking seriously I would not have allowed
thee to go so far; so as to put a stop to thy long harangue by not listening to
thee I verily suspect that either thou dost not know me, or I do not know thee;
but no, I know well thou art Anselmo, and thou knowest that I am Lothario; the
misfortune is, it seems to me, that thou art not the Anselmo thou wert, and
must have thought that I am not the Lothario I should be; for the things that
thou hast said to me are not those of that Anselmo who was my friend, nor are
those that thou demandest of me what should be asked of the Lothario thou
knowest. True friends will prove their friends and make use of them, as a poet
has said, <i>usque ad aras;</i> whereby he meant that they will not make use of
their friendship in things that are contrary to God’s will. If this,
then, was a heathen’s feeling about friendship, how much more should it
be a Christian’s, who knows that the divine must not be forfeited for the
sake of any human friendship? And if a friend should go so far as to put aside
his duty to Heaven to fulfil his duty to his friend, it should not be in
matters that are trifling or of little moment, but in such as affect the
friend’s life and honour. Now tell me, Anselmo, in which of these two art
thou imperilled, that I should hazard myself to gratify thee, and do a thing so
detestable as that thou seekest of me? Neither forsooth; on the contrary, thou
dost ask of me, so far as I understand, to strive and labour to rob thee of
honour and life, and to rob myself of them at the same time; for if I take away
thy honour it is plain I take away thy life, as a man without honour is worse
than dead; and being the instrument, as thou wilt have it so, of so much wrong
to thee, shall not I, too, be left without honour, and consequently without
life? Listen to me, Anselmo my friend, and be not impatient to answer me until
I have said what occurs to me touching the object of thy desire, for there will
be time enough left for thee to reply and for me to hear.”
</p>
<p>
“Be it so,” said Anselmo, “say what thou wilt.”
</p>
<p>
Lothario then went on to say, “It seems to me, Anselmo, that thine is
just now the temper of mind which is always that of the Moors, who can never be
brought to see the error of their creed by quotations from the Holy Scriptures,
or by reasons which depend upon the examination of the understanding or are
founded upon the articles of faith, but must have examples that are palpable,
easy, intelligible, capable of proof, not admitting of doubt, with mathematical
demonstrations that cannot be denied, like, ‘<i>If equals be taken from
equals, the remainders are equal:</i>’ and if they do not understand this
in words, and indeed they do not, it has to be shown to them with the hands,
and put before their eyes, and even with all this no one succeeds in convincing
them of the truth of our holy religion. This same mode of proceeding I shall
have to adopt with thee, for the desire which has sprung up in thee is so
absurd and remote from everything that has a semblance of reason, that I feel
it would be a waste of time to employ it in reasoning with thy simplicity, for
at present I will call it by no other name; and I am even tempted to leave thee
in thy folly as a punishment for thy pernicious desire; but the friendship I
bear thee, which will not allow me to desert thee in such manifest danger of
destruction, keeps me from dealing so harshly by thee. And that thou mayest
clearly see this, say, Anselmo, hast thou not told me that I must force my suit
upon a modest woman, decoy one that is virtuous, make overtures to one that is
pure-minded, pay court to one that is prudent? Yes, thou hast told me so. Then,
if thou knowest that thou hast a wife, modest, virtuous, pure-minded and
prudent, what is it that thou seekest? And if thou believest that she will come
forth victorious from all my attacks—as doubtless she would—what
higher titles than those she possesses now dost thou think thou canst bestow
upon her then, or in what will she be better then than she is now? Either thou
dost not hold her to be what thou sayest, or thou knowest not what thou dost
demand. If thou dost not hold her to be what thou sayest, why dost thou seek to
prove her instead of treating her as guilty in the way that may seem best to
thee? but if she be as virtuous as thou believest, it is an uncalled-for
proceeding to make trial of truth itself, for, after trial, it will but be in
the same estimation as before. Thus, then, it is conclusive that to attempt
things from which harm rather than advantage may come to us is the part of
unreasoning and reckless minds, more especially when they are things which we
are not forced or compelled to attempt, and which show from afar that it is
plainly madness to attempt them.
</p>
<p>
“Difficulties are attempted either for the sake of God or for the sake of
the world, or for both; those undertaken for God’s sake are those which
the saints undertake when they attempt to live the lives of angels in
human bodies; those undertaken for the sake of the world are those of the
men who traverse such a vast expanse of water, such a variety of climates,
so many strange countries, to acquire what are called the blessings of
fortune; and those undertaken for the sake of God and the world together
are those of brave soldiers, who no sooner do they see in the enemy’s wall
a breach as wide as a cannon ball could make, than, casting aside all
fear, without hesitating, or heeding the manifest peril that threatens
them, borne onward by the desire of defending their faith, their country,
and their king, they fling themselves dauntlessly into the midst of the
thousand opposing deaths that await them. Such are the things that men are
wont to attempt, and there is honour, glory, gain, in attempting them,
however full of difficulty and peril they may be; but that which thou
sayest it is thy wish to attempt and carry out will not win thee the glory
of God nor the blessings of fortune nor fame among men; for even if the
issue be as thou wouldst have it, thou wilt be no happier, richer, or more
honoured than thou art this moment; and if it be otherwise thou wilt be
reduced to misery greater than can be imagined, for then it will avail
thee nothing to reflect that no one is aware of the misfortune that has
befallen thee; it will suffice to torture and crush thee that thou knowest
it thyself. And in confirmation of the truth of what I say, let me repeat
to thee a stanza made by the famous poet Luigi Tansillo at the end of the
first part of his ‘Tears of Saint Peter,’ which says thus:
</p>
<p class="poem">
The anguish and the shame but greater grew<br>
    In Peter’s heart as morning slowly came;<br>
No eye was there to see him, well he knew,<br>
    Yet he himself was to himself a shame;<br>
Exposed to all men’s gaze, or screened from view,<br>
    A noble heart will feel the pang the same;<br>
A prey to shame the sinning soul will be,<br>
Though none but heaven and earth its shame can see.
</p>
<p>
Thus by keeping it secret thou wilt not escape thy sorrow, but rather thou
wilt shed tears unceasingly, if not tears of the eyes, tears of blood from
the heart, like those shed by that simple doctor our poet tells us of,
that tried the test of the cup, which the wise Rinaldo, better advised,
refused to do; for though this may be a poetic fiction it contains a moral
lesson worthy of attention and study and imitation. Moreover by what I am
about to say to thee thou wilt be led to see the great error thou wouldst
commit.
</p>
<p>
“Tell me, Anselmo, if Heaven or good fortune had made thee master and
lawful owner of a diamond of the finest quality, with the excellence and
purity of which all the lapidaries that had seen it had been satisfied,
saying with one voice and common consent that in purity, quality, and
fineness, it was all that a stone of the kind could possibly be, thou
thyself too being of the same belief, as knowing nothing to the contrary,
would it be reasonable in thee to desire to take that diamond and place it
between an anvil and a hammer, and by mere force of blows and strength of
arm try if it were as hard and as fine as they said? And if thou didst,
and if the stone should resist so silly a test, that would add nothing to
its value or reputation; and if it were broken, as it might be, would not
all be lost? Undoubtedly it would, leaving its owner to be rated as a fool
in the opinion of all. Consider, then, Anselmo my friend, that Camilla is
a diamond of the finest quality as well in thy estimation as in that of
others, and that it is contrary to reason to expose her to the risk of
being broken; for if she remains intact she cannot rise to a higher value
than she now possesses; and if she give way and be unable to resist,
bethink thee now how thou wilt be deprived of her, and with what good
reason thou wilt complain of thyself for having been the cause of her ruin
and thine own. Remember there is no jewel in the world so precious as a
chaste and virtuous woman, and that the whole honour of women consists in
reputation; and since thy wife’s is of that high excellence that thou
knowest, wherefore shouldst thou seek to call that truth in question?
Remember, my friend, that woman is an imperfect animal, and that
impediments are not to be placed in her way to make her trip and fall, but
that they should be removed, and her path left clear of all obstacles, so
that without hindrance she may run her course freely to attain the desired
perfection, which consists in being virtuous. Naturalists tell us that the
ermine is a little animal which has a fur of purest white, and that when
the hunters wish to take it, they make use of this artifice. Having
ascertained the places which it frequents and passes, they stop the way to
them with mud, and then rousing it, drive it towards the spot, and as soon
as the ermine comes to the mud it halts, and allows itself to be taken
captive rather than pass through the mire, and spoil and sully its
whiteness, which it values more than life and liberty. The virtuous and
chaste woman is an ermine, and whiter and purer than snow is the virtue of
modesty; and he who wishes her not to lose it, but to keep and preserve
it, must adopt a course different from that employed with the ermine; he
must not put before her the mire of the gifts and attentions of
persevering lovers, because perhaps—and even without a perhaps—she
may not have sufficient virtue and natural strength in herself to pass
through and tread under foot these impediments; they must be removed, and
the brightness of virtue and the beauty of a fair fame must be put before
her. A virtuous woman, too, is like a mirror, of clear shining crystal,
liable to be tarnished and dimmed by every breath that touches it. She
must be treated as relics are; adored, not touched. She must be protected
and prized as one protects and prizes a fair garden full of roses and
flowers, the owner of which allows no one to trespass or pluck a blossom;
enough for others that from afar and through the iron grating they may
enjoy its fragrance and its beauty. Finally let me repeat to thee some
verses that come to my mind; I heard them in a modern comedy, and it seems
to me they bear upon the point we are discussing. A prudent old man was
giving advice to another, the father of a young girl, to lock her up,
watch over her and keep her in seclusion, and among other arguments he
used these:
</p>
<p class="poem">
Woman is a thing of glass;<br>
    But her brittleness ’tis best<br>
    Not too curiously to test:<br>
Who knows what may come to pass?<br>
<br>
Breaking is an easy matter,<br>
    And it’s folly to expose<br>
    What you cannot mend to blows;<br>
What you can’t make whole to shatter.<br>
<br>
This, then, all may hold as true,<br>
    And the reason’s plain to see;<br>
    For if Danaës there be,<br>
There are golden showers too.<br>
</p>
<p>
“All that I have said to thee so far, Anselmo, has had reference to what
concerns thee; now it is right that I should say something of what regards
myself; and if I be prolix, pardon me, for the labyrinth into which thou
hast entered and from which thou wouldst have me extricate thee makes it
necessary.
</p>
<p>
“Thou dost reckon me thy friend, and thou wouldst rob me of honour, a
thing wholly inconsistent with friendship; and not only dost thou aim at
this, but thou wouldst have me rob thee of it also. That thou wouldst rob
me of it is clear, for when Camilla sees that I pay court to her as thou
requirest, she will certainly regard me as a man without honour or right
feeling, since I attempt and do a thing so much opposed to what I owe to
my own position and thy friendship. That thou wouldst have me rob thee of
it is beyond a doubt, for Camilla, seeing that I press my suit upon her,
will suppose that I have perceived in her something light that has
encouraged me to make known to her my base desire; and if she holds
herself dishonoured, her dishonour touches thee as belonging to her; and
hence arises what so commonly takes place, that the husband of the
adulterous woman, though he may not be aware of or have given any cause
for his wife’s failure in her duty, or (being careless or negligent) have
had it in his power to prevent his dishonour, nevertheless is stigmatised
by a vile and reproachful name, and in a manner regarded with eyes of
contempt instead of pity by all who know of his wife’s guilt, though they
see that he is unfortunate not by his own fault, but by the lust of a
vicious consort. But I will tell thee why with good reason dishonour
attaches to the husband of the unchaste wife, though he know not that she
is so, nor be to blame, nor have done anything, or given any provocation
to make her so; and be not weary with listening to me, for it will be for
thy good.
</p>
<p>
“When God created our first parent in the earthly paradise, the Holy
Scripture says that he infused sleep into Adam and while he slept took a
rib from his left side of which he formed our mother Eve, and when Adam
awoke and beheld her he said, ‘This is flesh of my flesh, and bone of my
bone.’ And God said ‘For this shall a man leave his father and his mother,
and they shall be two in one flesh; and then was instituted the divine
sacrament of marriage, with such ties that death alone can loose them. And
such is the force and virtue of this miraculous sacrament that it makes
two different persons one and the same flesh; and even more than this when
the virtuous are married; for though they have two souls they have but one
will. And hence it follows that as the flesh of the wife is one and the
same with that of her husband the stains that may come upon it, or the
injuries it incurs fall upon the husband’s flesh, though he, as has been
said, may have given no cause for them; for as the pain of the foot or any
member of the body is felt by the whole body, because all is one flesh, as
the head feels the hurt to the ankle without having caused it, so the
husband, being one with her, shares the dishonour of the wife; and as all
worldly honour or dishonour comes of flesh and blood, and the erring
wife’s is of that kind, the husband must needs bear his part of it and be
held dishonoured without knowing it. See, then, Anselmo, the peril thou
art encountering in seeking to disturb the peace of thy virtuous consort;
see for what an empty and ill-advised curiosity thou wouldst rouse up
passions that now repose in quiet in the breast of thy chaste wife;
reflect that what thou art staking all to win is little, and what thou
wilt lose so much that I leave it undescribed, not having the words to
express it. But if all I have said be not enough to turn thee from thy
vile purpose, thou must seek some other instrument for thy dishonour and
misfortune; for such I will not consent to be, though I lose thy
friendship, the greatest loss that I can conceive.”
</p>
<p>
Having said this, the wise and virtuous Lothario was silent, and Anselmo,
troubled in mind and deep in thought, was unable for a while to utter a
word in reply; but at length he said, “I have listened, Lothario my
friend, attentively, as thou hast seen, to what thou hast chosen to say to
me, and in thy arguments, examples, and comparisons I have seen that high
intelligence thou dost possess, and the perfection of true friendship thou
hast reached; and likewise I see and confess that if I am not guided by
thy opinion, but follow my own, I am flying from the good and pursuing the
evil. This being so, thou must remember that I am now labouring under that
infirmity which women sometimes suffer from, when the craving seizes them
to eat clay, plaster, charcoal, and things even worse, disgusting to look
at, much more to eat; so that it will be necessary to have recourse to
some artifice to cure me; and this can be easily effected if only thou
wilt make a beginning, even though it be in a lukewarm and make-believe
fashion, to pay court to Camilla, who will not be so yielding that her
virtue will give way at the first attack: with this mere attempt I shall
rest satisfied, and thou wilt have done what our friendship binds thee to
do, not only in giving me life, but in persuading me not to discard my
honour. And this thou art bound to do for one reason alone, that, being,
as I am, resolved to apply this test, it is not for thee to permit me to
reveal my weakness to another, and so imperil that honour thou art
striving to keep me from losing; and if thine may not stand as high as it
ought in the estimation of Camilla while thou art paying court to her,
that is of little or no importance, because ere long, on finding in her
that constancy which we expect, thou canst tell her the plain truth as
regards our stratagem, and so regain thy place in her esteem; and as thou
art venturing so little, and by the venture canst afford me so much
satisfaction, refuse not to undertake it, even if further difficulties
present themselves to thee; for, as I have said, if thou wilt only make a
beginning I will acknowledge the issue decided.”
</p>
<p>
Lothario seeing the fixed determination of Anselmo, and not knowing what
further examples to offer or arguments to urge in order to dissuade him
from it, and perceiving that he threatened to confide his pernicious
scheme to someone else, to avoid a greater evil resolved to gratify him
and do what he asked, intending to manage the business so as to satisfy
Anselmo without corrupting the mind of Camilla; so in reply he told him
not to communicate his purpose to any other, for he would undertake the
task himself, and would begin it as soon as he pleased. Anselmo embraced
him warmly and affectionately, and thanked him for his offer as if he had
bestowed some great favour upon him; and it was agreed between them to set
about it the next day, Anselmo affording opportunity and time to Lothario
to converse alone with Camilla, and furnishing him with money and jewels
to offer and present to her. He suggested, too, that he should treat her
to music, and write verses in her praise, and if he was unwilling to take
the trouble of composing them, he offered to do it himself. Lothario
agreed to all with an intention very different from what Anselmo supposed,
and with this understanding they returned to Anselmo’s house, where they
found Camilla awaiting her husband anxiously and uneasily, for he was
later than usual in returning that day. Lothario repaired to his own
house, and Anselmo remained in his, as well satisfied as Lothario was
troubled in mind; for he could see no satisfactory way out of this
ill-advised business. That night, however, he thought of a plan by which
he might deceive Anselmo without any injury to Camilla. The next day he
went to dine with his friend, and was welcomed by Camilla, who received
and treated him with great cordiality, knowing the affection her husband
felt for him. When dinner was over and the cloth removed, Anselmo told
Lothario to stay there with Camilla while he attended to some pressing
business, as he would return in an hour and a half. Camilla begged him not
to go, and Lothario offered to accompany him, but nothing could persuade
Anselmo, who on the contrary pressed Lothario to remain waiting for him as
he had a matter of great importance to discuss with him. At the same time
he bade Camilla not to leave Lothario alone until he came back. In short
he contrived to put so good a face on the reason, or the folly, of his
absence that no one could have suspected it was a pretence.
</p>
<p>
Anselmo took his departure, and Camilla and Lothario were left alone at
the table, for the rest of the household had gone to dinner. Lothario saw
himself in the lists according to his friend’s wish, and facing an enemy
that could by her beauty alone vanquish a squadron of armed knights; judge
whether he had good reason to fear; but what he did was to lean his elbow
on the arm of the chair, and his cheek upon his hand, and, asking
Camilla’s pardon for his ill manners, he said he wished to take a little
sleep until Anselmo returned. Camilla in reply said he could repose more
at his ease in the reception-room than in his chair, and begged of him to
go in and sleep there; but Lothario declined, and there he remained asleep
until the return of Anselmo, who finding Camilla in her own room, and
Lothario asleep, imagined that he had stayed away so long as to have
afforded them time enough for conversation and even for sleep, and was all
impatience until Lothario should wake up, that he might go out with him
and question him as to his success. Everything fell out as he wished;
Lothario awoke, and the two at once left the house, and Anselmo asked what
he was anxious to know, and Lothario in answer told him that he had not
thought it advisable to declare himself entirely the first time, and
therefore had only extolled the charms of Camilla, telling her that all
the city spoke of nothing else but her beauty and wit, for this seemed to
him an excellent way of beginning to gain her good-will and render her
disposed to listen to him with pleasure the next time, thus availing
himself of the device the devil has recourse to when he would deceive one
who is on the watch; for he being the angel of darkness transforms himself
into an angel of light, and, under cover of a fair seeming, discloses
himself at length, and effects his purpose if at the beginning his wiles
are not discovered. All this gave great satisfaction to Anselmo, and he
said he would afford the same opportunity every day, but without leaving
the house, for he would find things to do at home so that Camilla should
not detect the plot.
</p>
<p>
Thus, then, several days went by, and Lothario, without uttering a word to
Camilla, reported to Anselmo that he had talked with her and that he had
never been able to draw from her the slightest indication of consent to
anything dishonourable, nor even a sign or shadow of hope; on the
contrary, he said she would inform her husband of it.
</p>
<p>
“So far well,” said Anselmo; “Camilla has thus far resisted words; we must
now see how she will resist deeds. I will give you to-morrow two thousand
crowns in gold for you to offer or even present, and as many more to buy
jewels to lure her, for women are fond of being becomingly attired and
going gaily dressed, and all the more so if they are beautiful, however
chaste they may be; and if she resists this temptation, I will rest
satisfied and will give you no more trouble.”
</p>
<p>
Lothario replied that now he had begun he would carry on the undertaking
to the end, though he perceived he was to come out of it wearied and
vanquished. The next day he received the four thousand crowns, and with
them four thousand perplexities, for he knew not what to say by way of a
new falsehood; but in the end he made up his mind to tell him that Camilla
stood as firm against gifts and promises as against words, and that there
was no use in taking any further trouble, for the time was all spent to no
purpose.
</p>
<p>
But chance, directing things in a different manner, so ordered it that
Anselmo, having left Lothario and Camilla alone as on other occasions,
shut himself into a chamber and posted himself to watch and listen through
the keyhole to what passed between them, and perceived that for more than
half an hour Lothario did not utter a word to Camilla, nor would utter a
word though he were to be there for an age; and he came to the conclusion
that what his friend had told him about the replies of Camilla was all
invention and falsehood, and to ascertain if it were so, he came out, and
calling Lothario aside asked him what news he had and in what humour
Camilla was. Lothario replied that he was not disposed to go on with the
business, for she had answered him so angrily and harshly that he had no
heart to say anything more to her.
</p>
<p>
“Ah, Lothario, Lothario,” said Anselmo, “how ill dost thou meet thy
obligations to me, and the great confidence I repose in thee! I have been
just now watching through this keyhole, and I have seen that thou hast not
said a word to Camilla, whence I conclude that on the former occasions
thou hast not spoken to her either, and if this be so, as no doubt it is,
why dost thou deceive me, or wherefore seekest thou by craft to deprive me
of the means I might find of attaining my desire?”
</p>
<p>
Anselmo said no more, but he had said enough to cover Lothario with shame
and confusion, and he, feeling as it were his honour touched by having
been detected in a lie, swore to Anselmo that he would from that moment
devote himself to satisfying him without any deception, as he would see if
he had the curiosity to watch; though he need not take the trouble, for
the pains he would take to satisfy him would remove all suspicions from
his mind. Anselmo believed him, and to afford him an opportunity more free
and less liable to surprise, he resolved to absent himself from his house
for eight days, betaking himself to that of a friend of his who lived in a
village not far from the city; and, the better to account for his
departure to Camilla, he so arranged it that the friend should send him a
very pressing invitation.
</p>
<p>
Unhappy, shortsighted Anselmo, what art thou doing, what art thou
plotting, what art thou devising? Bethink thee thou art working against
thyself, plotting thine own dishonour, devising thine own ruin. Thy wife
Camilla is virtuous, thou dost possess her in peace and quietness, no one
assails thy happiness, her thoughts wander not beyond the walls of thy
house, thou art her heaven on earth, the object of her wishes, the
fulfilment of her desires, the measure wherewith she measures her will,
making it conform in all things to thine and Heaven’s. If, then, the mine
of her honour, beauty, virtue, and modesty yields thee without labour all
the wealth it contains and thou canst wish for, why wilt thou dig the
earth in search of fresh veins, of new unknown treasure, risking the
collapse of all, since it but rests on the feeble props of her weak
nature? Bethink thee that from him who seeks impossibilities that which is
possible may with justice be withheld, as was better expressed by a poet
who said:
</p>
<p class="poem">
’Tis mine to seek for life in death,<br>
    Health in disease seek I,<br>
I seek in prison freedom’s breath,<br>
    In traitors loyalty.<br><br>
So Fate that ever scorns to grant<br>
    Or grace or boon to me,<br>
Since what can never be I want,<br>
    Denies me what might be.<br>
</p>
<p>
The next day Anselmo took his departure for the village, leaving
instructions with Camilla that during his absence Lothario would come to
look after his house and to dine with her, and that she was to treat him
as she would himself. Camilla was distressed, as a discreet and
right-minded woman would be, at the orders her husband left her, and bade
him remember that it was not becoming that anyone should occupy his seat
at the table during his absence, and if he acted thus from not feeling
confidence that she would be able to manage his house, let him try her
this time, and he would find by experience that she was equal to greater
responsibilities. Anselmo replied that it was his pleasure to have it so,
and that she had only to submit and obey. Camilla said she would do so,
though against her will.
</p>
<p>
Anselmo went, and the next day Lothario came to his house, where he was
received by Camilla with a friendly and modest welcome; but she never
suffered Lothario to see her alone, for she was always attended by her men
and women servants, especially by a handmaid of hers, Leonela by name, to
whom she was much attached (for they had been brought up together from
childhood in her father’s house), and whom she had kept with her after her
marriage with Anselmo. The first three days Lothario did not speak to her,
though he might have done so when they removed the cloth and the servants
retired to dine hastily; for such were Camilla’s orders; nay more, Leonela
had directions to dine earlier than Camilla and never to leave her side.
She, however, having her thoughts fixed upon other things more to her
taste, and wanting that time and opportunity for her own pleasures, did
not always obey her mistress’s commands, but on the contrary left them
alone, as if they had ordered her to do so; but the modest bearing of
Camilla, the calmness of her countenance, the composure of her aspect were
enough to bridle the tongue of Lothario. But the influence which the many
virtues of Camilla exerted in imposing silence on Lothario’s tongue proved
mischievous for both of them, for if his tongue was silent his thoughts
were busy, and could dwell at leisure upon the perfections of Camilla’s
goodness and beauty one by one, charms enough to warm with love a marble
statue, not to say a heart of flesh. Lothario gazed upon her when he might
have been speaking to her, and thought how worthy of being loved she was;
and thus reflection began little by little to assail his allegiance to
Anselmo, and a thousand times he thought of withdrawing from the city and
going where Anselmo should never see him nor he see Camilla. But already
the delight he found in gazing on her interposed and held him fast. He put
a constraint upon himself, and struggled to repel and repress the pleasure
he found in contemplating Camilla; when alone he blamed himself for his
weakness, called himself a bad friend, nay a bad Christian; then he argued
the matter and compared himself with Anselmo; always coming to the
conclusion that the folly and rashness of Anselmo had been worse than his
faithlessness, and that if he could excuse his intentions as easily before
God as with man, he had no reason to fear any punishment for his offence.
</p>
<p>
In short the beauty and goodness of Camilla, joined with the opportunity
which the blind husband had placed in his hands, overthrew the loyalty of
Lothario; and giving heed to nothing save the object towards which his
inclinations led him, after Anselmo had been three days absent, during
which he had been carrying on a continual struggle with his passion, he
began to make love to Camilla with so much vehemence and warmth of
language that she was overwhelmed with amazement, and could only rise from
her place and retire to her room without answering him a word. But the
hope which always springs up with love was not weakened in Lothario by
this repelling demeanour; on the contrary his passion for Camilla
increased, and she discovering in him what she had never expected, knew
not what to do; and considering it neither safe nor right to give him the
chance or opportunity of speaking to her again, she resolved to send, as
she did that very night, one of her servants with a letter to Anselmo, in
which she addressed the following words to him.
</p>
</div><p><!--end chapter-->
</p><div class="chapter">
<h3>
<a id="ch34"></a>CHAPTER XXXIV.<br>
IN WHICH IS CONTINUED THE NOVEL OF “THE ILL-ADVISED CURIOSITY”
</h3>
<p>
“It is commonly said that an army looks ill without its general and a
castle without its castellan, and I say that a young married woman looks
still worse without her husband unless there are very good reasons for it.
I find myself so ill at ease without you, and so incapable of enduring
this separation, that unless you return quickly I shall have to go for
relief to my parents’ house, even if I leave yours without a protector;
for the one you left me, if indeed he deserved that title, has, I think,
more regard to his own pleasure than to what concerns you: as you are
possessed of discernment I need say no more to you, nor indeed is it
fitting I should say more.”
</p>
<p>
Anselmo received this letter, and from it he gathered that Lothario had
already begun his task and that Camilla must have replied to him as he
would have wished; and delighted beyond measure at such intelligence he
sent word to her not to leave his house on any account, as he would very
shortly return. Camilla was astonished at Anselmo’s reply, which placed
her in greater perplexity than before, for she neither dared to remain in
her own house, nor yet to go to her parents’; for in remaining her virtue
was imperilled, and in going she was opposing her husband’s commands.
Finally she decided upon what was the worse course for her, to remain,
resolving not to fly from the presence of Lothario, that she might not
give food for gossip to her servants; and she now began to regret having
written as she had to her husband, fearing he might imagine that Lothario
had perceived in her some lightness which had impelled him to lay aside
the respect he owed her; but confident of her rectitude she put her trust
in God and in her own virtuous intentions, with which she hoped to resist
in silence all the solicitations of Lothario, without saying anything to
her husband so as not to involve him in any quarrel or trouble; and she
even began to consider how to excuse Lothario to Anselmo when he should
ask her what it was that induced her to write that letter. With these
resolutions, more honourable than judicious or effectual, she remained the
next day listening to Lothario, who pressed his suit so strenuously that
Camilla’s firmness began to waver, and her virtue had enough to do to come
to the rescue of her eyes and keep them from showing signs of a certain
tender compassion which the tears and appeals of Lothario had awakened in
her bosom. Lothario observed all this, and it inflamed him all the more.
In short he felt that while Anselmo’s absence afforded time and
opportunity he must press the siege of the fortress, and so he assailed
her self-esteem with praises of her beauty, for there is nothing that more
quickly reduces and levels the castle towers of fair women’s vanity than
vanity itself upon the tongue of flattery. In fact with the utmost
assiduity he undermined the rock of her purity with such engines that had
Camilla been of brass she must have fallen. He wept, he entreated, he
promised, he flattered, he importuned, he pretended with so much feeling
and apparent sincerity, that he overthrew the virtuous resolves of Camilla
and won the triumph he least expected and most longed for. Camilla
yielded, Camilla fell; but what wonder if the friendship of Lothario could
not stand firm? A clear proof to us that the passion of love is to be
conquered only by flying from it, and that no one should engage in a
struggle with an enemy so mighty; for divine strength is needed to
overcome his human power. Leonela alone knew of her mistress’s weakness,
for the two false friends and new lovers were unable to conceal it.
Lothario did not care to tell Camilla the object Anselmo had in view, nor
that he had afforded him the opportunity of attaining such a result, lest
she should undervalue his love and think that it was by chance and without
intending it and not of his own accord that he had made love to her.
</p>
<p>
A few days later Anselmo returned to his house and did not perceive what
it had lost, that which he so lightly treated and so highly prized. He
went at once to see Lothario, and found him at home; they embraced each
other, and Anselmo asked for the tidings of his life or his death.
</p>
<p>
“The tidings I have to give thee, Anselmo my friend,” said Lothario, “are
that thou dost possess a wife that is worthy to be the pattern and crown
of all good wives. The words that I have addressed to her were borne away
on the wind, my promises have been despised, my presents have been
refused, such feigned tears as I shed have been turned into open ridicule.
In short, as Camilla is the essence of all beauty, so is she the
treasure-house where purity dwells, and gentleness and modesty abide with
all the virtues that can confer praise, honour, and happiness upon a
woman. Take back thy money, my friend; here it is, and I have had no need
to touch it, for the chastity of Camilla yields not to things so base as
gifts or promises. Be content, Anselmo, and refrain from making further
proof; and as thou hast passed dryshod through the sea of those doubts and
suspicions that are and may be entertained of women, seek not to plunge
again into the deep ocean of new embarrassments, or with another pilot
make trial of the goodness and strength of the bark that Heaven has
granted thee for thy passage across the sea of this world; but reckon
thyself now safe in port, moor thyself with the anchor of sound
reflection, and rest in peace until thou art called upon to pay that debt
which no nobility on earth can escape paying.”
</p>
<p>
Anselmo was completely satisfied by the words of Lothario, and believed
them as fully as if they had been spoken by an oracle; nevertheless he
begged of him not to relinquish the undertaking, were it but for the sake
of curiosity and amusement; though thenceforward he need not make use of
the same earnest endeavours as before; all he wished him to do was to
write some verses to her, praising her under the name of Chloris, for he
himself would give her to understand that he was in love with a lady to
whom he had given that name to enable him to sing her praises with the
decorum due to her modesty; and if Lothario were unwilling to take the
trouble of writing the verses he would compose them himself.
</p>
<p>
“That will not be necessary,” said Lothario, “for the muses are not such
enemies of mine but that they visit me now and then in the course of the
year. Do thou tell Camilla what thou hast proposed about a pretended amour
of mine; as for the verses I will make them, and if not as good as the
subject deserves, they shall be at least the best I can produce.” An
agreement to this effect was made between the friends, the ill-advised one
and the treacherous, and Anselmo returning to his house asked Camilla the
question she already wondered he had not asked before—what it was
that had caused her to write the letter she had sent him. Camilla replied
that it had seemed to her that Lothario looked at her somewhat more freely
than when he had been at home; but that now she was undeceived and
believed it to have been only her own imagination, for Lothario now
avoided seeing her, or being alone with her. Anselmo told her she might be
quite easy on the score of that suspicion, for he knew that Lothario was
in love with a damsel of rank in the city whom he celebrated under the
name of Chloris, and that even if he were not, his fidelity and their
great friendship left no room for fear. Had not Camilla, however, been
informed beforehand by Lothario that this love for Chloris was a pretence,
and that he himself had told Anselmo of it in order to be able sometimes
to give utterance to the praises of Camilla herself, no doubt she would
have fallen into the despairing toils of jealousy; but being forewarned
she received the startling news without uneasiness.
</p>
<p>
The next day as the three were at table Anselmo asked Lothario to recite
something of what he had composed for his mistress Chloris; for as Camilla
did not know her, he might safely say what he liked.
</p>
<p>
“Even did she know her,” returned Lothario, “I would hide nothing, for
when a lover praises his lady’s beauty, and charges her with cruelty, he
casts no imputation upon her fair name; at any rate, all I can say is that
yesterday I made a sonnet on the ingratitude of this Chloris, which goes
thus:
</p>
<p class="poem">
SONNET<br>
<br>
At midnight, in the silence, when the eyes<br>
Of happier mortals balmy slumbers close,<br>
The weary tale of my unnumbered woes<br>
To Chloris and to Heaven is wont to rise.<br>
And when the light of day returning dyes<br>
The portals of the east with tints of rose,<br>
With undiminished force my sorrow flows<br>
In broken accents and in burning sighs.<br>
And when the sun ascends his star-girt throne,<br>
And on the earth pours down his midday beams,<br>
Noon but renews my wailing and my tears;<br>
And with the night again goes up my moan.<br>
Yet ever in my agony it seems<br>
To me that neither Heaven nor Chloris hears.”<br>
</p>
<p>
The sonnet pleased Camilla, and still more Anselmo, for he praised it and
said the lady was excessively cruel who made no return for sincerity so
manifest. On which Camilla said, “Then all that love-smitten poets say is
true?”
</p>
<p>
“As poets they do not tell the truth,” replied Lothario; “but as lovers
they are not more defective in expression than they are truthful.”
</p>
<p>
“There is no doubt of that,” observed Anselmo, anxious to support and
uphold Lothario’s ideas with Camilla, who was as regardless of his design
as she was deep in love with Lothario; and so taking delight in anything
that was his, and knowing that his thoughts and writings had her for their
object, and that she herself was the real Chloris, she asked him to repeat
some other sonnet or verses if he recollected any.
</p>
<p>
“I do,” replied Lothario, “but I do not think it as good as the first one,
or, more correctly speaking, less bad; but you can easily judge, for it is
this.
</p>
<p class="poem">
SONNET<br>
<br>
I know that I am doomed; death is to me<br>
As certain as that thou, ungrateful fair,<br>
Dead at thy feet shouldst see me lying, ere<br>
My heart repented of its love for thee.<br>
If buried in oblivion I should be,<br>
Bereft of life, fame, favour, even there<br>
It would be found that I thy image bear<br>
Deep graven in my breast for all to see.<br>
This like some holy relic do I prize<br>
To save me from the fate my truth entails,<br>
Truth that to thy hard heart its vigour owes.<br>
Alas for him that under lowering skies,<br>
In peril o’er a trackless ocean sails,<br>
Where neither friendly port nor pole-star shows.”<br>
</p>
<p>
Anselmo praised this second sonnet too, as he had praised the first; and
so he went on adding link after link to the chain with which he was
binding himself and making his dishonour secure; for when Lothario was
doing most to dishonour him he told him he was most honoured; and thus
each step that Camilla descended towards the depths of her abasement, she
mounted, in his opinion, towards the summit of virtue and fair fame.
</p>
<p>
It so happened that finding herself on one occasion alone with her maid,
Camilla said to her, “I am ashamed to think, my dear Leonela, how lightly
I have valued myself that I did not compel Lothario to purchase by at
least some expenditure of time that full possession of me that I so
quickly yielded him of my own free will. I fear that he will think ill of
my pliancy or lightness, not considering the irresistible influence he
brought to bear upon me.”
</p>
<p>
“Let not that trouble you, my lady,” said Leonela, “for it does not take
away the value of the thing given or make it the less precious to give it
quickly if it be really valuable and worthy of being prized; nay, they are
wont to say that he who gives quickly gives twice.”
</p>
<p>
“They say also,” said Camilla, “that what costs little is valued less.”
</p>
<p>
“That saying does not hold good in your case,” replied Leonela, “for love,
as I have heard say, sometimes flies and sometimes walks; with this one it
runs, with that it moves slowly; some it cools, others it burns; some it
wounds, others it slays; it begins the course of its desires, and at the
same moment completes and ends it; in the morning it will lay siege to a
fortress and by night will have taken it, for there is no power that can
resist it; so what are you in dread of, what do you fear, when the same
must have befallen Lothario, love having chosen the absence of my lord as
the instrument for subduing you? and it was absolutely necessary to
complete then what love had resolved upon, without affording the time to
let Anselmo return and by his presence compel the work to be left
unfinished; for love has no better agent for carrying out his designs than
opportunity; and of opportunity he avails himself in all his feats,
especially at the outset. All this I know well myself, more by experience
than by hearsay, and some day, señora, I will enlighten you on the
subject, for I am of your flesh and blood too. Moreover, lady Camilla, you
did not surrender yourself or yield so quickly but that first you saw
Lothario’s whole soul in his eyes, in his sighs, in his words, his
promises and his gifts, and by it and his good qualities perceived how
worthy he was of your love. This, then, being the case, let not these
scrupulous and prudish ideas trouble your imagination, but be assured that
Lothario prizes you as you do him, and rest content and satisfied that as
you are caught in the noose of love it is one of worth and merit that has
taken you, and one that has not only the four S’s that they say true
lovers ought to have, but a complete alphabet; only listen to me and you
will see how I can repeat it by rote. He is to my eyes and thinking,
Amiable, Brave, Courteous, Distinguished, Elegant, Fond, Gay, Honourable,
Illustrious, Loyal, Manly, Noble, Open, Polite, Quickwitted, Rich, and the
S’s according to the saying, and then Tender, Veracious: X does not suit
him, for it is a rough letter; Y has been given already; and Z Zealous for
your honour.”
</p>
<p>
Camilla laughed at her maid’s alphabet, and perceived her to be more
experienced in love affairs than she said, which she admitted, confessing
to Camilla that she had love passages with a young man of good birth of
the same city. Camilla was uneasy at this, dreading lest it might prove
the means of endangering her honour, and asked whether her intrigue had
gone beyond words, and she with little shame and much effrontery said it
had; for certain it is that ladies’ imprudences make servants shameless,
who, when they see their mistresses make a false step, think nothing of
going astray themselves, or of its being known. All that Camilla could do
was to entreat Leonela to say nothing about her doings to him whom she
called her lover, and to conduct her own affairs secretly lest they should
come to the knowledge of Anselmo or of Lothario. Leonela said she would,
but kept her word in such a way that she confirmed Camilla’s apprehension
of losing her reputation through her means; for this abandoned and bold
Leonela, as soon as she perceived that her mistress’s demeanour was not
what it was wont to be, had the audacity to introduce her lover into the
house, confident that even if her mistress saw him she would not dare to
expose him; for the sins of mistresses entail this mischief among others;
they make themselves the slaves of their own servants, and are obliged to
hide their laxities and depravities; as was the case with Camilla, who
though she perceived, not once but many times, that Leonela was with her
lover in some room of the house, not only did not dare to chide her, but
afforded her opportunities for concealing him and removed all
difficulties, lest he should be seen by her husband. She was unable,
however, to prevent him from being seen on one occasion, as he sallied
