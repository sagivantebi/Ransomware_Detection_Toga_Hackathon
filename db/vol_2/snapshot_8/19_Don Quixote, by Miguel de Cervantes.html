Don Antonio Moreno followed the Knight of the White Moon, and a number of
boys followed him too, nay pursued him, until they had him fairly housed
in a hostel in the heart of the city. Don Antonio, eager to make his
acquaintance, entered also; a squire came out to meet him and remove his
armour, and he shut himself into a lower room, still attended by Don
Antonio, whose bread would not bake until he had found out who he was. He
of the White Moon, seeing then that the gentleman would not leave him,
said, “I know very well, señor, what you have come for; it is to
find out who I am; and as there is no reason why I should conceal it from
you, while my servant here is taking off my armour I will tell you the
true state of the case, without leaving out anything. You must know,
señor, that I am called the bachelor Samson Carrasco. I am of the same
village as Don Quixote of La Mancha, whose craze and folly make all of us
who know him feel pity for him, and I am one of those who have felt it
most; and persuaded that his chance of recovery lay in quiet and keeping
at home and in his own house, I hit upon a device for keeping him there.
Three months ago, therefore, I went out to meet him as a knight-errant,
under the assumed name of the Knight of the Mirrors, intending to engage
him in combat and overcome him without hurting him, making it the
condition of our combat that the vanquished should be at the disposal of
the victor. What I meant to demand of him (for I regarded him as
vanquished already) was that he should return to his own village, and not
leave it for a whole year, by which time he might be cured. But fate
ordered it otherwise, for he vanquished me and unhorsed me, and so my plan
failed. He went his way, and I came back conquered, covered with shame,
and sorely bruised by my fall, which was a particularly dangerous one. But
this did not quench my desire to meet him again and overcome him, as you
have seen to-day. And as he is so scrupulous in his observance of the laws
of knight-errantry, he will, no doubt, in order to keep his word, obey the
injunction I have laid upon him. This, señor, is how the matter stands,
and I have nothing more to tell you. I implore of you not to betray me, or
tell Don Quixote who I am; so that my honest endeavours may be successful,
and that a man of excellent wits—were he only rid of the fooleries
of chivalry—may get them back again.”
</p>
<p>
“O señor,” said Don Antonio, “may God forgive you the
wrong you have done the whole world in trying to bring the most amusing
madman in it back to his senses. Do you not see, señor, that the gain by
Don Quixote’s sanity can never equal the enjoyment his crazes give?
But my belief is that all the señor bachelor’s pains will be of no
avail to bring a man so hopelessly cracked to his senses again; and if it
were not uncharitable, I would say may Don Quixote never be cured, for by
his recovery we lose not only his own drolleries, but his squire Sancho
Panza’s too, any one of which is enough to turn melancholy itself
into merriment. However, I’ll hold my peace and say nothing to him,
and we’ll see whether I am right in my suspicion that Señor Carrasco’s
efforts will be fruitless.”
</p>
<p>
The bachelor replied that at all events the affair promised well, and he
hoped for a happy result from it; and putting his services at Don Antonio’s
commands he took his leave of him; and having had his armour packed at
once upon a mule, he rode away from the city the same day on the horse he
rode to battle, and returned to his own country without meeting any
adventure calling for record in this veracious history.
</p>
<p>
Don Antonio reported to the viceroy what Carrasco told him, and the
viceroy was not very well pleased to hear it, for with Don Quixote’s
retirement there was an end to the amusement of all who knew anything of
his mad doings.
</p>
<p>
Six days did Don Quixote keep his bed, dejected, melancholy, moody and out
of sorts, brooding over the unhappy event of his defeat. Sancho strove to
comfort him, and among other things he said to him, “Hold up your
head, señor, and be of good cheer if you can, and give thanks to heaven
that if you have had a tumble to the ground you have not come off with a
broken rib; and, as you know that ‘where they give they take,’
and that ‘there are not always fletches where there are pegs,’
a fig for the doctor, for there’s no need of him to cure this
ailment. Let us go home, and give over going about in search of adventures
in strange lands and places; rightly looked at, it is I that am the
greater loser, though it is your worship that has had the worse usage.
With the government I gave up all wish to be a governor again, but I did
not give up all longing to be a count; and that will never come to pass if
your worship gives up becoming a king by renouncing the calling of
chivalry; and so my hopes are going to turn into smoke.”
</p>
<p>
“Peace, Sancho,” said Don Quixote; “thou seest my
suspension and retirement is not to exceed a year; I shall soon return to
my honoured calling, and I shall not be at a loss for a kingdom to win and
a county to bestow on thee.”
</p>
<p>
“May God hear it and sin be deaf,” said Sancho; “I have
always heard say that ‘a good hope is better than a bad holding.”
</p>
<p>
As they were talking Don Antonio came in looking extremely pleased and
exclaiming, “Reward me for my good news, Señor Don Quixote! Don
Gregorio and the renegade who went for him have come ashore—ashore
do I say? They are by this time in the viceroy’s house, and will be
here immediately.”
</p>
<p>
Don Quixote cheered up a little and said, “Of a truth I am almost
ready to say I should have been glad had it turned out just the other way,
for it would have obliged me to cross over to Barbary, where by the might
of my arm I should have restored to liberty, not only Don Gregorio, but
all the Christian captives there are in Barbary. But what am I saying,
miserable being that I am? Am I not he that has been conquered? Am I not
he that has been overthrown? Am I not he who must not take up arms for a
year? Then what am I making professions for; what am I bragging about;
when it is fitter for me to handle the distaff than the sword?”
</p>
<p>
“No more of that, señor,” said Sancho; “‘let the
hen live, even though it be with her pip;’ ‘to-day for thee and
to-morrow for me;’ in these affairs of encounters and whacks one
must not mind them, for he that falls to-day may get up to-morrow; unless
indeed he chooses to lie in bed, I mean gives way to weakness and does not
pluck up fresh spirit for fresh battles; let your worship get up now to
receive Don Gregorio; for the household seems to be in a bustle, and no
doubt he has come by this time;” and so it proved, for as soon as
Don Gregorio and the renegade had given the viceroy an account of the
voyage out and home, Don Gregorio, eager to see Ana Felix, came with the
renegade to Don Antonio’s house. When they carried him away from
Algiers he was in woman’s dress; on board the vessel, however, he
exchanged it for that of a captive who escaped with him; but in whatever
dress he might be he looked like one to be loved and served and esteemed,
for he was surpassingly well-favoured, and to judge by appearances some
seventeen or eighteen years of age. Ricote and his daughter came out to
welcome him, the father with tears, the daughter with bashfulness. They
did not embrace each other, for where there is deep love there will never
be overmuch boldness. Seen side by side, the comeliness of Don Gregorio
and the beauty of Ana Felix were the admiration of all who were present.
It was silence that spoke for the lovers at that moment, and their eyes
were the tongues that declared their pure and happy feelings. The renegade
explained the measures and means he had adopted to rescue Don Gregorio,
and Don Gregorio at no great length, but in a few words, in which he
showed that his intelligence was in advance of his years, described the
peril and embarrassment he found himself in among the women with whom he
had sojourned. To conclude, Ricote liberally recompensed and rewarded as
well the renegade as the men who had rowed; and the renegade effected his
readmission into the body of the Church and was reconciled with it, and
from a rotten limb became by penance and repentance a clean and sound one.
</p>
<p>
Two days later the viceroy discussed with Don Antonio the steps they
should take to enable Ana Felix and her father to stay in Spain, for it
seemed to them there could be no objection to a daughter who was so good a
Christian and a father to all appearance so well disposed remaining there.
Don Antonio offered to arrange the matter at the capital, whither he was
compelled to go on some other business, hinting that many a difficult
affair was settled there with the help of favour and bribes.
</p>
<p>
“Nay,” said Ricote, who was present during the conversation,
“it will not do to rely upon favour or bribes, because with the
great Don Bernardino de Velasco, Conde de Salazar, to whom his Majesty has
entrusted our expulsion, neither entreaties nor promises, bribes nor
appeals to compassion, are of any use; for though it is true he mingles
mercy with justice, still, seeing that the whole body of our nation is
tainted and corrupt, he applies to it the cautery that burns rather than
the salve that soothes; and thus, by prudence, sagacity, care and the fear
he inspires, he has borne on his mighty shoulders the weight of this great
policy and carried it into effect, all our schemes and plots,
importunities and wiles, being ineffectual to blind his Argus eyes, ever
on the watch lest one of us should remain behind in concealment, and like
a hidden root come in course of time to sprout and bear poisonous fruit in
Spain, now cleansed, and relieved of the fear in which our vast numbers
kept it. Heroic resolve of the great Philip the Third, and unparalleled
wisdom to have entrusted it to the said Don Bernardino de Velasco!”
</p>
<p>
“At any rate,” said Don Antonio, “when I am there I will
make all possible efforts, and let heaven do as pleases it best; Don
Gregorio will come with me to relieve the anxiety which his parents must
be suffering on account of his absence; Ana Felix will remain in my house
with my wife, or in a monastery; and I know the viceroy will be glad that
the worthy Ricote should stay with him until we see what terms I can make.”
</p>
<p>
The viceroy agreed to all that was proposed; but Don Gregorio on learning
what had passed declared he could not and would not on any account leave
Ana Felix; however, as it was his purpose to go and see his parents and
devise some way of returning for her, he fell in with the proposed
arrangement. Ana Felix remained with Don Antonio’s wife, and Ricote
in the viceroy’s house.
</p>
<p>
The day for Don Antonio’s departure came; and two days later that
for Don Quixote’s and Sancho’s, for Don Quixote’s fall
did not suffer him to take the road sooner. There were tears and sighs,
swoonings and sobs, at the parting between Don Gregorio and Ana Felix.
Ricote offered Don Gregorio a thousand crowns if he would have them, but
he would not take any save five which Don Antonio lent him and he promised
to repay at the capital. So the two of them took their departure, and Don
Quixote and Sancho afterwards, as has been already said, Don Quixote

As he left Barcelona, Don Quixote turned gaze upon the spot where he had
fallen. “Here Troy was,” said he; “here my ill-luck, not
my cowardice, robbed me of all the glory I had won; here Fortune made me
the victim of her caprices; here the lustre of my achievements was dimmed;
here, in a word, fell my happiness never to rise again.”

<p>
“Señor,” said Sancho on hearing this, “it is the part of
brave hearts to be patient in adversity just as much as to be glad in
prosperity; I judge by myself, for, if when I was a governor I was glad,
now that I am a squire and on foot I am not sad; and I have heard say that
she whom commonly they call Fortune is a drunken whimsical jade, and, what
is more, blind, and therefore neither sees what she does, nor knows whom
she casts down or whom she sets up.”
</p>
<p>
“Thou art a great philosopher, Sancho,” said Don Quixote;
“thou speakest very sensibly; I know not who taught thee. But I can
tell thee there is no such thing as Fortune in the world, nor does
anything which takes place there, be it good or bad, come about by chance,
but by the special preordination of heaven; and hence the common saying
that ‘each of us is the maker of his own Fortune.’ I have been
that of mine; but not with the proper amount of prudence, and my
self-confidence has therefore made me pay dearly; for I ought to have
reflected that Rocinante’s feeble strength could not resist the
mighty bulk of the Knight of the White Moon’s horse. In a word, I
ventured it, I did my best, I was overthrown, but though I lost my honour
I did not lose nor can I lose the virtue of keeping my word. When I was a
knight-errant, daring and valiant, I supported my achievements by hand and
deed, and now that I am a humble squire I will support my words by keeping
the promise I have given. Forward then, Sancho my friend, let us go to
keep the year of the novitiate in our own country, and in that seclusion
we shall pick up fresh strength to return to the by me never-forgotten
calling of arms.”
</p>
<p>
“Señor,” returned Sancho, “travelling on foot is not
such a pleasant thing that it makes me feel disposed or tempted to make
long marches. Let us leave this armour hung up on some tree, instead of
someone that has been hanged; and then with me on Dapple’s back and
my feet off the ground we will arrange the stages as your worship pleases
to measure them out; but to suppose that I am going to travel on foot, and
make long ones, is to suppose nonsense.”
</p>
<p>
“Thou sayest well, Sancho,” said Don Quixote; “let my
armour be hung up for a trophy, and under it or round it we will carve on
the trees what was inscribed on the trophy of Roland’s armour-
</p>
<p class="poem">
These let none move<br>
Who dareth not his might with Roland prove.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s the very thing,” said Sancho; “and if it
was not that we should feel the want of Rocinante on the road, it would be
as well to leave him hung up too.”
</p>
<p>
“And yet, I had rather not have either him or the armour hung up,”
said Don Quixote, “that it may not be said, ‘for good service
a bad return.’”
</p>
<p>
“Your worship is right,” said Sancho; “for, as sensible
people hold, ‘the fault of the ass must not be laid on the
pack-saddle;’ and, as in this affair the fault is your worship’s,
punish yourself and don’t let your anger break out against the
already battered and bloody armour, or the meekness of Rocinante, or the
tenderness of my feet, trying to make them travel more than is reasonable.”

</p>
<p>
In converse of this sort the whole of that day went by, as did the four
succeeding ones, without anything occurring to interrupt their journey,
but on the fifth as they entered a village they found a great number of
people at the door of an inn enjoying themselves, as it was a holiday.
Upon Don Quixote’s approach a peasant called out, “One of
these two gentlemen who come here, and who don’t know the parties,
will tell us what we ought to do about our wager.”
</p>
<p>
“That I will, certainly,” said Don Quixote, “and
according to the rights of the case, if I can manage to understand it.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, here it is, worthy sir,” said the peasant; “a man
of this village who is so fat that he weighs twenty stone challenged
another, a neighbour of his, who does not weigh more than nine, to run a
race. The agreement was that they were to run a distance of a hundred
paces with equal weights; and when the challenger was asked how the
weights were to be equalised he said that the other, as he weighed nine
stone, should put eleven in iron on his back, and that in this way the
twenty stone of the thin man would equal the twenty stone of the fat one.”
</p>
<p>
“Not at all,” exclaimed Sancho at once, before Don Quixote
could answer; “it’s for me, that only a few days ago left off
being a governor and a judge, as all the world knows, to settle these
doubtful questions and give an opinion in disputes of all sorts.”
</p>
<p>
“Answer in God’s name, Sancho my friend,” said Don
Quixote, “for I am not fit to give crumbs to a cat, my wits are so
confused and upset.”
</p>
<p>
With this permission Sancho said to the peasants who stood clustered round
him, waiting with open mouths for the decision to come from his, “Brothers,
what the fat man requires is not in reason, nor has it a shadow of justice
in it; because, if it be true, as they say, that the challenged may choose
the weapons, the other has no right to choose such as will prevent and
keep him from winning. My decision, therefore, is that the fat challenger
prune, peel, thin, trim and correct himself, and take eleven stone of his
flesh off his body, here or there, as he pleases, and as suits him best;
and being in this way reduced to nine stone weight, he will make himself
equal and even with nine stone of his opponent, and they will be able to
run on equal terms.”
</p>
<p>
“By all that’s good,” said one of the peasants as he
heard Sancho’s decision, “but the gentleman has spoken like a
saint, and given judgment like a canon! But I’ll be bound the fat
man won’t part with an ounce of his flesh, not to say eleven stone.”
</p>
<p>
“The best plan will be for them not to run,” said another,
“so that neither the thin man break down under the weight, nor the
fat one strip himself of his flesh; let half the wager be spent in wine,
and let’s take these gentlemen to the tavern where there’s the
best, and ‘over me be the cloak when it rains.’”
</p>
<p>
“I thank you, sirs,” said Don Quixote; “but I cannot
stop for an instant, for sad thoughts and unhappy circumstances force me
to seem discourteous and to travel apace;” and spurring Rocinante he
pushed on, leaving them wondering at what they had seen and heard, at his
own strange figure and at the shrewdness of his servant, for such they
took Sancho to be; and another of them observed, “If the servant is
so clever, what must the master be? I’ll bet, if they are going to
wilt.”
Salamanca to study, they’ll come to be alcaldes of the Court in a
trice; for it’s a mere joke—only to read and read, and have
interest and good luck; and before a man knows where he is he finds
himself with a staff in his hand or a mitre on his head.”
</p>
<p>
That night master and man passed out in the fields in the open air, and
the next day as they were pursuing their journey they saw coming towards
them a man on foot with alforjas at the neck and a javelin or spiked staff
in his hand, the very cut of a foot courier; who, as soon as he came close
to Don Quixote, increased his pace and half running came up to him, and
embracing his right thigh, for he could reach no higher, exclaimed with
evident pleasure, “O Señor Don Quixote of La Mancha, what happiness
it will be to the heart of my lord the duke when he knows your worship is
coming back to his castle, for he is still there with my lady the duchess!”
</p>
<p>
“I do not recognise you, friend,” said Don Quixote, “nor
do I know who you are, unless you tell me.”
</p>
<p>
“I am Tosilos, my lord the duke’s lacquey, Señor Don Quixote,”
replied the courier; “he who refused to fight your worship about
marrying the daughter of Doña Rodriguez.”
</p>
<p>
“God bless me!” exclaimed Don Quixote; “is it possible
that you are the one whom mine enemies the enchanters changed into the
lacquey you speak of in order to rob me of the honour of that battle?”
</p>
<p>
“Nonsense, good sir!” said the messenger; “there was no
enchantment or transformation at all; I entered the lists just as much
lacquey Tosilos as I came out of them lacquey Tosilos. I thought to marry
without fighting, for the girl had taken my fancy; but my scheme had a
very different result, for as soon as your worship had left the castle my
lord the duke had a hundred strokes of the stick given me for having acted
contrary to the orders he gave me before engaging in the combat; and the
end of the whole affair is that the girl has become a nun, and Doña
Rodriguez has gone back to Castile, and I am now on my way to Barcelona
with a packet of letters for the viceroy which my master is sending him.
If your worship would like a drop, sound though warm, I have a gourd here
full of the best, and some scraps of Tronchon cheese that will serve as a
provocative and wakener of your thirst if so be it is asleep.”
</p>
<p>
“I take the offer,” said Sancho; “no more compliments
about it; pour out, good Tosilos, in spite of all the enchanters in the
Indies.”
</p>
<p>
“Thou art indeed the greatest glutton in the world, Sancho,”
said Don Quixote, “and the greatest booby on earth, not to be able
to see that this courier is enchanted and this Tosilos a sham one; stop
with him and take thy fill; I will go on slowly and wait for thee to come
up with me.”
</p>
<p>
The lacquey laughed, unsheathed his gourd, unwalletted his scraps, and
taking out a small loaf of bread he and Sancho seated themselves on the
green grass, and in peace and good fellowship finished off the contents of
the alforjas down to the bottom, so resolutely that they licked the
wrapper of the letters, merely because it smelt of cheese.
</p>
<p>
Said Tosilos to Sancho, “Beyond a doubt, Sancho my friend, this
master of thine ought to be a madman.”
</p>
<p>
“Ought!” said Sancho; “he owes no man anything; he pays
for everything, particularly when the coin is madness. I see it plain
enough, and I tell him so plain enough; but what’s the use?
especially now that it is all over with him, for here he is beaten by the
Knight of the White Moon.”
</p>
<p>
Tosilos begged him to explain what had happened him, but Sancho replied
that it would not be good manners to leave his master waiting for him; and
that some other day if they met there would be time enough for that; and
then getting up, after shaking his doublet and brushing the crumbs out of
his beard, he drove Dapple on before him, and bidding adieu to Tosilos
left him and rejoined his master, who was waiting for him under the shade
of a tree.

If a multitude of reflections used to harass Don Quixote before he had
been overthrown, a great many more harassed him since his fall. He was
under the shade of a tree, as has been said, and there, like flies on
honey, thoughts came crowding upon him and stinging him. Some of them
turned upon the disenchantment of Dulcinea, others upon the life he was
about to lead in his enforced retirement. Sancho came up and spoke in high
praise of the generous disposition of the lacquey Tosilos.
</p>
<p>
“Is it possible, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “that thou
dost still think that he yonder is a real lacquey? Apparently it has
escaped thy memory that thou hast seen Dulcinea turned and transformed
into a peasant wench, and the Knight of the Mirrors into the bachelor
Carrasco; all the work of the enchanters that persecute me. But tell me
now, didst thou ask this Tosilos, as thou callest him, what has become of
Altisidora, did she weep over my absence, or has she already consigned to
oblivion the love thoughts that used to afflict her when I was present?”
</p>
<p>
“The thoughts that I had,” said Sancho, “were not such
as to leave time for asking fool’s questions. Body o’ me,
señor! is your worship in a condition now to inquire into other people’s
thoughts, above all love thoughts?”
</p>
<p>
“Look ye, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “there is a great
difference between what is done out of love and what is done out of
gratitude. A knight may very possibly be proof against love; but it is
impossible, strictly speaking, for him to be ungrateful. Altisidora, to
all appearance, loved me truly; she gave me the three kerchiefs thou
knowest of; she wept at my departure, she cursed me, she abused me,
casting shame to the winds she bewailed herself in public; all signs that
she adored me; for the wrath of lovers always ends in curses. I had no
hopes to give her, nor treasures to offer her, for mine are given to
Dulcinea, and the treasures of knights-errant are like those of the
fairies,’ illusory and deceptive; all I can give her is the place in
my memory I keep for her, without prejudice, however, to that which I hold
devoted to Dulcinea, whom thou art wronging by thy remissness in whipping
thyself and scourging that flesh—would that I saw it eaten by wolves—which
would rather keep itself for the worms than for the relief of that poor
lady.”
</p>
<p>
“Señor,” replied Sancho, “if the truth is to be told, I
cannot persuade myself that the whipping of my backside has anything to do
with the disenchantment of the enchanted; it is like saying, ‘If
your head aches rub ointment on your knees;’ at any rate I’ll
make bold to swear that in all the histories dealing with knight-errantry
that your worship has read you have never come across anybody disenchanted
by whipping; but whether or no I’ll whip myself when I have a fancy
for it, and the opportunity serves for scourging myself comfortably.”
</p>
<p>
“God grant it,” said Don Quixote; “and heaven give thee
grace to take it to heart and own the obligation thou art under to help my
lady, who is thine also, inasmuch as thou art mine.”
</p>
<p>
As they pursued their journey talking in this way they came to the very
same spot where they had been trampled on by the bulls. Don Quixote
recognised it, and said he to Sancho, “This is the meadow where we
came upon those gay shepherdesses and gallant shepherds who were trying to
revive and imitate the pastoral Arcadia there, an idea as novel as it was
happy, in emulation whereof, if so be thou dost approve of it, Sancho, I
would have ourselves turn shepherds, at any rate for the time I have to
live in retirement. I will buy some ewes and everything else requisite for
the pastoral calling; and, I under the name of the shepherd Quixotize and
thou as the shepherd Panzino, we will roam the woods and groves and
meadows singing songs here, lamenting in elegies there, drinking of the
crystal waters of the springs or limpid brooks or flowing rivers. The oaks
will yield us their sweet fruit with bountiful hand, the trunks of the
hard cork trees a seat, the willows shade, the roses perfume, the
widespread meadows carpets tinted with a thousand dyes; the clear pure air
will give us breath, the moon and stars lighten the darkness of the night
for us, song shall be our delight, lamenting our joy, Apollo will supply
us with verses, and love with conceits whereby we shall make ourselves
famed for ever, not only in this but in ages to come.”
</p>
<p>
“Egad,” said Sancho, “but that sort of life squares, nay
corners, with my notions; and what is more the bachelor Samson Carrasco
and Master Nicholas the barber won’t have well seen it before they’ll
want to follow it and turn shepherds along with us; and God grant it may
not come into the curate’s head to join the sheepfold too, he’s
so jovial and fond of enjoying himself.”
</p>
<p>
“Thou art in the right of it, Sancho,” said Don Quixote;
“and the bachelor Samson Carrasco, if he enters the pastoral
fraternity, as no doubt he will, may call himself the shepherd Samsonino,
or perhaps the shepherd Carrascon; Nicholas the barber may call himself
Niculoso, as old Boscan formerly was called Nemoroso; as for the curate I
don’t know what name we can fit to him unless it be something
derived from his title, and we call him the shepherd Curiambro. For the
shepherdesses whose lovers we shall be, we can pick names as we would
pears; and as my lady’s name does just as well for a shepherdess’s
as for a princess’s, I need not trouble myself to look for one that
will suit her better; to thine, Sancho, thou canst give what name thou
wilt.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t mean to give her any but Teresona,” said
Sancho, “which will go well with her stoutness and with her own
right name, as she is called Teresa; and then when I sing her praises in
my verses I’ll show how chaste my passion is, for I’m not
going to look ‘for better bread than ever came from wheat’ in
other men’s houses. It won’t do for the curate to have a
shepherdess, for the sake of good example; and if the bachelor chooses to
have one, that is his look-out.”
</p>
<p>
“God bless me, Sancho my friend!” said Don Quixote, “what
a life we shall lead! What hautboys and Zamora bagpipes we shall hear,
what tabors, timbrels, and rebecks! And then if among all these different
sorts of music that of the albogues is heard, almost all the pastoral
instruments will be there.”
</p>
<p>
“What are albogues?” asked Sancho, “for I never in my
life heard tell of them or saw them.”
</p>
<p>
“Albogues,” said Don Quixote, “are brass plates like
candlesticks that struck against one another on the hollow side make a noise
which, if not very pleasing or harmonious, is not disagreeable and accords very
well with the rude notes of the bagpipe and tabor. The word albogue is Morisco,
as are all those in our Spanish tongue that begin with <i>al;</i> for example,
<i>almohaza, almorzar, alhombra, alguacil, alhucema, almacen, alcancia</i>, and
others of the same sort, of which there are not many more; our language has
only three that are Morisco and end in <i>i</i>, which are <i>borceguí,
zaquizamí</i>, and <i>maravedí. Alhelí</i> and <i>alfaquí</i> are seen to be
Arabic, as well by the <i>al</i> at the beginning as by the <i>í</i> they end
with. I mention this incidentally, the chance allusion to albogues having
reminded me of it; and it will be of great assistance to us in the perfect
practice of this calling that I am something of a poet, as thou knowest, and
that besides the bachelor Samson Carrasco is an accomplished one. Of the curate
I say nothing; but I will wager he has some spice of the poet in him, and no
doubt Master Nicholas too, for all barbers, or most of them, are guitar players
and stringers of verses. I will bewail my separation; thou shalt glorify
thyself as a constant lover; the shepherd Carrascon will figure as a rejected
one, and the curate Curiambro as whatever may please him best; and so all will
go as gaily as heart could wish.”
</p>
<p>
To this Sancho made answer, “I am so unlucky, señor, that I’m
afraid the day will never come when I’ll see myself at such a
calling. O what neat spoons I’ll make when I’m a shepherd!
What messes, creams, garlands, pastoral odds and ends! And if they don’t
get me a name for wisdom, they’ll not fail to get me one for
ingenuity. My daughter Sanchica will bring us our dinner to the pasture.
But stay—she’s good-looking, and shepherds there are with more
mischief than simplicity in them; I would not have her ‘come for
wool and go back shorn;’ love-making and lawless desires are just as
common in the fields as in the cities, and in shepherds’ shanties as
did not embrace each other, for where there is deep love there will never
in royal palaces; ‘do away with the cause, you do away with the sin;’
‘if eyes don’t see hearts don’t break’ and ‘better
a clear escape than good men’s prayers.’”
</p>
<p>
“A truce to thy proverbs, Sancho,” exclaimed Don Quixote;
“any one of those thou hast uttered would suffice to explain thy
meaning; many a time have I recommended thee not to be so lavish with
proverbs and to exercise some moderation in delivering them; but it seems
to me it is only ‘preaching in the desert;’ ‘my mother
beats me and I go on with my tricks.”
</p>
<p>
“It seems to me,” said Sancho, “that your worship is
like the common saying, ‘Said the frying-pan to the kettle, Get
away, blackbreech.’ You chide me for uttering proverbs, and you
string them in couples yourself.”
</p>
<p>
“Observe, Sancho,” replied Don Quixote, “I bring in
proverbs to the purpose, and when I quote them they fit like a ring to the
finger; thou bringest them in by the head and shoulders, in such a way
that thou dost drag them in, rather than introduce them; if I am not
mistaken, I have told thee already that proverbs are short maxims drawn
from the experience and observation of our wise men of old; but the
proverb that is not to the purpose is a piece of nonsense and not a maxim.
But enough of this; as nightfall is drawing on let us retire some little
distance from the high road to pass the night; what is in store for us
to-morrow God knoweth.”
</p>
<p>
They turned aside, and supped late and poorly, very much against Sancho’s
will, who turned over in his mind the hardships attendant upon
knight-errantry in woods and forests, even though at times plenty
presented itself in castles and houses, as at Don Diego de Miranda’s,
at the wedding of Camacho the Rich, and at Don Antonio Moreno’s; he
reflected, however, that it could not be always day, nor always night; and
so that night he passed in sleeping, and his master in waking.

<p>
The night was somewhat dark, for though there was a moon in the sky it was
not in a quarter where she could be seen; for sometimes the lady Diana
goes on a stroll to the antipodes, and leaves the mountains all black and
the valleys in darkness. Don Quixote obeyed nature so far as to sleep his
first sleep, but did not give way to the second, very different from
Sancho, who never had any second, because with him sleep lasted from night
till morning, wherein he showed what a sound constitution and few cares he
had. Don Quixote’s cares kept him restless, so much so that he awoke
Sancho and said to him, “I am amazed, Sancho, at the unconcern of
thy temperament. I believe thou art made of marble or hard brass,
incapable of any emotion or feeling whatever. I lie awake while thou
sleepest, I weep while thou singest, I am faint with fasting while thou
art sluggish and torpid from pure repletion. It is the duty of good
servants to share the sufferings and feel the sorrows of their masters, if
it be only for the sake of appearances. See the calmness of the night, the
solitude of the spot, inviting us to break our slumbers by a vigil of some
sort. Rise as thou livest, and retire a little distance, and with a good
heart and cheerful courage give thyself three or four hundred lashes on
account of Dulcinea’s disenchantment score; and this I entreat of
thee, making it a request, for I have no desire to come to grips with thee
a second time, as I know thou hast a heavy hand. As soon as thou hast laid
them on we will pass the rest of the night, I singing my separation, thou
thy constancy, making a beginning at once with the pastoral life we are to
follow at our village.”
</p>
<p>
“Señor,” replied Sancho, “I’m no monk to get up
out of the middle of my sleep and scourge myself, nor does it seem to me
that one can pass from one extreme of the pain of whipping to the other of
music. Will your worship let me sleep, and not worry me about whipping
myself? or you’ll make me swear never to touch a hair of my doublet,
not to say my flesh.”
</p>
<p>
“O hard heart!” said Don Quixote, “O pitiless squire! O
bread ill-bestowed and favours ill-acknowledged, both those I have done
thee and those I mean to do thee! Through me hast thou seen thyself a
governor, and through me thou seest thyself in immediate expectation of
being a count, or obtaining some other equivalent title, for I—<i>post
tenebras spero lucem</i>.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know what that is,” said Sancho; “all I
know is that so long as I am asleep I have neither fear nor hope, trouble
nor glory; and good luck betide him that invented sleep, the cloak that
covers over all a man’s thoughts, the food that removes hunger, the
drink that drives away thirst, the fire that warms the cold, the cold that
tempers the heat, and, to wind up with, the universal coin wherewith
everything is bought, the weight and balance that makes the shepherd equal
with the king and the fool with the wise man. Sleep, I have heard say, has
only one fault, that it is like death; for between a sleeping man and a
dead man there is very little difference.”
</p>
<p>
“Never have I heard thee speak so elegantly as now, Sancho,”
said Don Quixote; “and here I begin to see the truth of the proverb
thou dost sometimes quote, ‘Not with whom thou art bred, but with
whom thou art fed.’”
</p>
<p>
“Ha, by my life, master mine,” said Sancho, “it’s
not I that am stringing proverbs now, for they drop in pairs from your
worship’s mouth faster than from mine; only there is this difference
between mine and yours, that yours are well-timed and mine are untimely;
but anyhow, they are all proverbs.”
</p>
<p>
At this point they became aware of a harsh indistinct noise that seemed to
spread through all the valleys around. Don Quixote stood up and laid his
hand upon his sword, and Sancho ensconced himself under Dapple and put the
bundle of armour on one side of him and the ass’s pack-saddle on the
other, in fear and trembling as great as Don Quixote’s perturbation.
Each instant the noise increased and came nearer to the two terrified men,
or at least to one, for as to the other, his courage is known to all. The
fact of the matter was that some men were taking above six hundred pigs to
sell at a fair, and were on their way with them at that hour, and so great
was the noise they made and their grunting and blowing, that they deafened
the ears of Don Quixote and Sancho Panza, and they could not make out what
it was. The wide-spread grunting drove came on in a surging mass, and
without showing any respect for Don Quixote’s dignity or Sancho’s,
passed right over the pair of them, demolishing Sancho’s
entrenchments, and not only upsetting Don Quixote but sweeping Rocinante
off his feet into the bargain; and what with the trampling and the
grunting, and the pace at which the unclean beasts went, pack-saddle,
armour, Dapple and Rocinante were left scattered on the ground and Sancho
and Don Quixote at their wits’ end.
</p>
<p>
Sancho got up as well as he could and begged his master to give him his
sword, saying he wanted to kill half a dozen of those dirty unmannerly
pigs, for he had by this time found out that that was what they were.
</p>
<p>
“Let them be, my friend,” said Don Quixote; “this insult
is the penalty of my sin; and it is the righteous chastisement of heaven
that jackals should devour a vanquished knight, and wasps sting him and
pigs trample him under foot.”
</p>
<p>
“I suppose it is the chastisement of heaven, too,” said
Sancho, “that flies should prick the squires of vanquished knights,
and lice eat them, and hunger assail them. If we squires were the sons of
the knights we serve, or their very near relations, it would be no wonder
if the penalty of their misdeeds overtook us, even to the fourth
generation. But what have the Panzas to do with the Quixotes? Well, well,
let’s lie down again and sleep out what little of the night there’s
left, and God will send us dawn and we shall be all right.”
</p>
<p>
<br><br><br><br> <a id="p68b"></a>
</p>
<div class="fig" style="width:60%;">
<img alt="p68b.jpg (345K)" src="images/p68b.jpg" style="width:100%;" id="id-5836967731208632496">

</p>
<p>
“Sleep thou, Sancho,” returned Don Quixote, “for thou
wast born to sleep as I was born to watch; and during the time it now
wants of dawn I will give a loose rein to my thoughts, and seek a vent for
them in a little madrigal which, unknown to thee, I composed in my head
last night.”
</p>
<p>
“I should think,” said Sancho, “that the thoughts that
allow one to make verses cannot be of great consequence; let your worship
string verses as much as you like and I’ll sleep as much as I can;”
and forthwith, taking the space of ground he required, he muffled himself
up and fell into a sound sleep, undisturbed by bond, debt, or trouble of
any sort. Don Quixote, propped up against the trunk of a beech or a cork
tree—for Cide Hamete does not specify what kind of tree it was—sang
in this strain to the accompaniment of his own sighs:
</p>
<p class="poem">
When in my mind<br>
I muse, O Love, upon thy cruelty,<br>
To death I flee,<br>
In hope therein the end of all to find.<br>
<br>
But drawing near<br>
That welcome haven in my sea of woe,<br>
Such joy I know,<br>
That life revives, and still I linger here.<br>
<br>
Thus life doth slay,<br>
And death again to life restoreth me;<br>
Strange destiny,<br>
That deals with life and death as with a play!<br>
</p>
<p>
He accompanied each verse with many sighs and not a few tears, just like
one whose heart was pierced with grief at his defeat and his separation
from Dulcinea.
</p>
<p>
And now daylight came, and the sun smote Sancho on the eyes with his
beams. He awoke, roused himself up, shook himself and stretched his lazy
limbs, and seeing the havoc the pigs had made with his stores he cursed
the drove, and more besides. Then the pair resumed their journey, and as
evening closed in they saw coming towards them some ten men on horseback
and four or five on foot. Don Quixote’s heart beat quick and Sancho’s
quailed with fear, for the persons approaching them carried lances and
bucklers, and were in very warlike guise. Don Quixote turned to Sancho and
said, “If I could make use of my weapons, and my promise had not
tied my hands, I would count this host that comes against us but cakes and
fancy bread; but perhaps it may prove something different from what we
apprehend.” The men on horseback now came up, and raising their
lances surrounded Don Quixote in silence, and pointed them at his back and
breast, menacing him with death. One of those on foot, putting his finger
to his lips as a sign to him to be silent, seized Rocinante’s bridle
and drew him out of the road, and the others driving Sancho and Dapple
before them, and all maintaining a strange silence, followed in the steps
of the one who led Don Quixote. The latter two or three times attempted to
ask where they were taking him to and what they wanted, but the instant he
began to open his lips they threatened to close them with the points of
their lances; and Sancho fared the same way, for the moment he seemed
about to speak one of those on foot punched him with a goad, and Dapple
likewise, as if he too wanted to talk. Night set in, they quickened their
pace, and the fears of the two prisoners grew greater, especially as they
heard themselves assailed with—“Get on, ye Troglodytes;”
“Silence, ye barbarians;” “March, ye cannibals;”
“No murmuring, ye Scythians;” “Don’t open your
eyes, ye murderous Polyphemes, ye blood-thirsty lions,” and suchlike
names with which their captors harassed the ears of the wretched master
and man. Sancho went along saying to himself, “We, tortolites,
barbers, animals! I don’t like those names at all; ‘it’s
in a bad wind our corn is being winnowed;’ ‘misfortune comes
upon us all at once like sticks on a dog,’ and God grant it may be
no worse than them that this unlucky adventure has in store for us.”
</p>
<p>
Don Quixote rode completely dazed, unable with the aid of all his wits to
make out what could be the meaning of these abusive names they called
them, and the only conclusion he could arrive at was that there was no
good to be hoped for and much evil to be feared. And now, about an hour
after midnight, they reached a castle which Don Quixote saw at once was
the duke’s, where they had been but a short time before. “God
bless me!” said he, as he recognised the mansion, “what does
this mean? It is all courtesy and politeness in this house; but with the
vanquished good turns into evil, and evil into worse.”
</p>
<p>
They entered the chief court of the castle and found it prepared and
fitted up in a style that added to their amazement and doubled their
fears, as will be seen in the following chapter.

<p>
The horsemen dismounted, and, together with the men on foot, without a
moment’s delay taking up Sancho and Don Quixote bodily, they carried
them into the court, all round which near a hundred torches fixed in
sockets were burning, besides above five hundred lamps in the corridors,
so that in spite of the night, which was somewhat dark, the want of
daylight could not be perceived. In the middle of the court was a
catafalque, raised about two yards above the ground and covered completely
by an immense canopy of black velvet, and on the steps all round it white
wax tapers burned in more than a hundred silver candlesticks. Upon the
catafalque was seen the dead body of a damsel so lovely that by her beauty
she made death itself look beautiful. She lay with her head resting upon a
cushion of brocade and crowned with a garland of sweet-smelling flowers of
divers sorts, her hands crossed upon her bosom, and between them a branch
of yellow palm of victory. On one side of the court was erected a stage,
where upon two chairs were seated two persons who from having crowns on
their heads and sceptres in their hands appeared to be kings of some sort,
whether real or mock ones. By the side of this stage, which was reached by
steps, were two other chairs on which the men carrying the prisoners
seated Don Quixote and Sancho, all in silence, and by signs giving them to
understand that they too were to be silent; which, however, they would
have been without any signs, for their amazement at all they saw held them
tongue-tied. And now two persons of distinction, who were at once
recognised by Don Quixote as his hosts the duke and duchess, ascended the
stage attended by a numerous suite, and seated themselves on two gorgeous
chairs close to the two kings, as they seemed to be. Who would not have
been amazed at this? Nor was this all, for Don Quixote had perceived that
the dead body on the catafalque was that of the fair Altisidora. As the
duke and duchess mounted the stage Don Quixote and Sancho rose and made
them a profound obeisance, which they returned by bowing their heads
slightly. At this moment an official crossed over, and approaching Sancho
threw over him a robe of black buckram painted all over with flames of
fire, and taking off his cap put upon his head a mitre such as those
undergoing the sentence of the Holy Office wear; and whispered in his ear
that he must not open his lips, or they would put a gag upon him, or take
his life. Sancho surveyed himself from head to foot and saw himself all
ablaze with flames; but as they did not burn him, he did not care two
farthings for them. He took off the mitre and seeing it painted with
devils he put it on again, saying to himself, “Well, so far those
don’t burn me nor do these carry me off.” Don Quixote surveyed
him too, and though fear had got the better of his faculties, he could not
help smiling to see the figure Sancho presented. And now from underneath
the catafalque, so it seemed, there rose a low sweet sound of flutes,
which, coming unbroken by human voice (for there silence itself kept
silence), had a soft and languishing effect. Then, beside the pillow of
what seemed to be the dead body, suddenly appeared a fair youth in a Roman
habit, who, to the accompaniment of a harp which he himself played, sang
in a sweet and clear voice these two stanzas:
</p>
<p class="poem">
While fair Altisidora, who the sport<br>
    Of cold Don Quixote’s cruelty hath been,<br>
Returns to life, and in this magic court<br>
    The dames in sables come to grace the scene,<br>
And while her matrons all in seemly sort<br>
    My lady robes in baize and bombazine,<br>
Her beauty and her sorrows will I sing<br>
With defter quill than touched the Thracian string.<br>
<br>
But not in life alone, methinks, to me<br>
    Belongs the office; Lady, when my tongue<br>
Is cold in death, believe me, unto thee<br>
    My voice shall raise its tributary song.<br>
My soul, from this strait prison-house set free,<br>
    As o’er the Stygian lake it floats along,<br>
Thy praises singing still shall hold its way,<br>
And make the waters of oblivion stay.<br>
</p>
<p>
At this point one of the two that looked like kings exclaimed, “Enough,
enough, divine singer! It would be an endless task to put before us now
the death and the charms of the peerless Altisidora, not dead as the
ignorant world imagines, but living in the voice of fame and in the
penance which Sancho Panza, here present, has to undergo to restore her to
the long-lost light. Do thou, therefore, O Rhadamanthus, who sittest in
judgment with me in the murky caverns of Dis, as thou knowest all that the
inscrutable fates have decreed touching the resuscitation of this damsel,
announce and declare it at once, that the happiness we look forward to
from her restoration be no longer deferred.”
</p>
<p>
No sooner had Minos the fellow judge of Rhadamanthus said this, than
Rhadamanthus rising up said:
</p>
<p>
“Ho, officials of this house, high and low, great and small, make
haste hither one and all, and print on Sancho’s face four-and-twenty
smacks, and give him twelve pinches and six pin thrusts in the back and
arms; for upon this ceremony depends the restoration of Altisidora.”
</p>
<p>
On hearing this Sancho broke silence and cried out, “By all that’s
good, I’ll as soon let my face be smacked or handled as turn Moor. Body
o’ me! What has handling my face got to do with the resurrection of this
damsel? ‘The old woman took kindly to the blits;’ they enchant
Dulcinea, and whip me in order to disenchant her; Altisidora dies of ailments
God was pleased to send her, and to bring her to life again they must give me
four-and-twenty smacks, and prick holes in my body with pins, and raise weals
on my arms with pinches! Try those jokes on a brother-in-law; ‘I’m
an old dog, and “tus, tus” is no use with me.’”
</p>
<p>
“Thou shalt die,” said Rhadamanthus in a loud voice; “relent,
thou tiger; humble thyself, proud Nimrod; suffer and he silent, for no
impossibilities are asked of thee; it is not for thee to inquire into the
difficulties in this matter; smacked thou must be, pricked thou shalt see
thyself, and with pinches thou must be made to howl. Ho, I say, officials,
obey my orders; or by the word of an honest man, ye shall see what ye were
born for.”
</p>
<p>
At this some six duennas, advancing across the court, made their
appearance in procession, one after the other, four of them with
spectacles, and all with their right hands uplifted, showing four fingers
of wrist to make their hands look longer, as is the fashion now-a-days. No
sooner had Sancho caught sight of them than, bellowing like a bull, he
exclaimed, “I might let myself be handled by all the world; but
allow duennas to touch me—not a bit of it! Scratch my face, as my
master was served in this very castle; run me through the body with
burnished daggers; pinch my arms with red-hot pincers; I’ll bear all
in patience to serve these gentlefolk; but I won’t let duennas touch
me, though the devil should carry me off!”
</p>
<p>
Here Don Quixote, too, broke silence, saying to Sancho, “Have
patience, my son, and gratify these noble persons, and give all thanks to
heaven that it has infused such virtue into thy person, that by its
sufferings thou canst disenchant the enchanted and restore to life the
dead.”
</p>
<p>
The duennas were now close to Sancho, and he, having become more tractable
and reasonable, settling himself well in his chair presented his face and
beard to the first, who delivered him a smack very stoutly laid on, and
then made him a low curtsey.
</p>
<p>
“Less politeness and less paint, señora duenna,” said Sancho;
“by God your hands smell of vinegar-wash.”
</p>
<p>
In line, all the duennas smacked him and several others of the household
pinched him; but what he could not stand was being pricked by the pins;
and so, apparently out of patience, he started up out of his chair, and
seizing a lighted torch that stood near him fell upon the duennas and the
whole set of his tormentors, exclaiming, “Begone, ye ministers of
hell; I’m not made of brass not to feel such out-of-the-way
tortures.”
</p>
<p>
At this instant Altisidora, who probably was tired of having been so long
lying on her back, turned on her side; seeing which the bystanders cried
out almost with one voice, “Altisidora is alive! Altisidora lives!”
</p>
<p>
Rhadamanthus bade Sancho put away his wrath, as the object they had in
view was now attained. When Don Quixote saw Altisidora move, he went on
his knees to Sancho saying to him, “Now is the time, son of my
bowels, not to call thee my squire, for thee to give thyself some of those
lashes thou art bound to lay on for the disenchantment of Dulcinea. Now, I
say, is the time when the virtue that is in thee is ripe, and endowed with
efficacy to work the good that is looked for from thee.”
</p>
<p>
To which Sancho made answer, “That’s trick upon trick, I
think, and not honey upon pancakes; a nice thing it would be for a
whipping to come now, on the top of pinches, smacks, and pin-proddings!
You had better take a big stone and tie it round my neck, and pitch me
into a well; I should not mind it much, if I’m to be always made the
cow of the wedding for the cure of other people’s ailments. Leave me
alone; or else by God I’ll fling the whole thing to the dogs, let
come what may.”
</p>
<p>
Altisidora had by this time sat up on the catafalque, and as she did so
the clarions sounded, accompanied by the flutes, and the voices of all
present exclaiming, “Long life to Altisidora! long life to
Altisidora!” The duke and duchess and the kings Minos and
Rhadamanthus stood up, and all, together with Don Quixote and Sancho,
advanced to receive her and take her down from the catafalque; and she,
making as though she were recovering from a swoon, bowed her head to the
duke and duchess and to the kings, and looking sideways at Don Quixote,
said to him, “God forgive thee, insensible knight, for through thy
cruelty I have been, to me it seems, more than a thousand years in the
other world; and to thee, the most compassionate upon earth, I render
thanks for the life I am now in possession of. From this day forth, friend
Sancho, count as thine six smocks of mine which I bestow upon thee, to
make as many shirts for thyself, and if they are not all quite whole, at
any rate they are all clean.”
</p>
<p>
Sancho kissed her hands in gratitude, kneeling, and with the mitre in his
hand. The duke bade them take it from him, and give him back his cap and
doublet and remove the flaming robe. Sancho begged the duke to let them
leave him the robe and mitre; as he wanted to take them home for a token
and memento of that unexampled adventure. The duchess said they must leave
them with him; for he knew already what a great friend of his she was. The
duke then gave orders that the court should be cleared, and that all
should retire to their chambers, and that Don Quixote and Sancho should be
conducted to their old quarters.

<p>
Sancho slept that night in a cot in the same chamber with Don Quixote, a
thing he would have gladly excused if he could for he knew very well that
with questions and answers his master would not let him sleep, and he was
in no humour for talking much, as he still felt the pain of his late
martyrdom, which interfered with his freedom of speech; and it would have
been more to his taste to sleep in a hovel alone, than in that luxurious
chamber in company. And so well founded did his apprehension prove, and so
correct was his anticipation, that scarcely had his master got into bed
when he said, “What dost thou think of to-night’s adventure,
Sancho? Great and mighty is the power of cold-hearted scorn, for thou with
thine own eyes hast seen Altisidora slain, not by arrows, nor by the
sword, nor by any warlike weapon, nor by deadly poisons, but by the
thought of the sternness and scorn with which I have always treated her.”
</p>
<p>
“She might have died and welcome,” said Sancho, “when
she pleased and how she pleased; and she might have left me alone, for I
never made her fall in love or scorned her. I don’t know nor can I
imagine how the recovery of Altisidora, a damsel more fanciful than wise,
can have, as I have said before, anything to do with the sufferings of
Sancho Panza. Now I begin to see plainly and clearly that there are
enchanters and enchanted people in the world; and may God deliver me from
them, since I can’t deliver myself; and so I beg of your worship to
let me sleep and not ask me any more questions, unless you want me to
throw myself out of the window.”
</p>
<p>
“Sleep, Sancho my friend,” said Don Quixote, “if the
pinprodding and pinches thou hast received and the smacks administered to
thee will let thee.”
</p>
<p>
“No pain came up to the insult of the smacks,” said Sancho,
“for the simple reason that it was duennas, confound them, that gave
them to me; but once more I entreat your worship to let me sleep, for
sleep is relief from misery to those who are miserable when awake.”
</p>
<p>
“Be it so, and God be with thee,” said Don Quixote.
</p>
<p>
They fell asleep, both of them, and Cide Hamete, the author of this great
history, took this opportunity to record and relate what it was that
induced the duke and duchess to get up the elaborate plot that has been
described. The bachelor Samson Carrasco, he says, not forgetting how he as
the Knight of the Mirrors had been vanquished and overthrown by Don
Quixote, which defeat and overthrow upset all his plans, resolved to try
his hand again, hoping for better luck than he had before; and so, having
learned where Don Quixote was from the page who brought the letter and
present to Sancho’s wife, Teresa Panza, he got himself new armour
and another horse, and put a white moon upon his shield, and to carry his
arms he had a mule led by a peasant, not by Tom Cecial his former squire
for fear he should be recognised by Sancho or Don Quixote. He came to the
duke’s castle, and the duke informed him of the road and route Don
Quixote had taken with the intention of being present at the jousts at
Saragossa. He told him, too, of the jokes he had practised upon him, and
of the device for the disenchantment of Dulcinea at the expense of Sancho’s
backside; and finally he gave him an account of the trick Sancho had
played upon his master, making him believe that Dulcinea was enchanted and
turned into a country wench; and of how the duchess, his wife, had
persuaded Sancho that it was he himself who was deceived, inasmuch as
Dulcinea was really enchanted; at which the bachelor laughed not a little,
and marvelled as well at the sharpness and simplicity of Sancho as at the
length to which Don Quixote’s madness went. The duke begged of him
if he found him (whether he overcame him or not) to return that way and
let him know the result. This the bachelor did; he set out in quest of Don
Quixote, and not finding him at Saragossa, he went on, and how he fared
has been already told. He returned to the duke’s castle and told him
all, what the conditions of the combat were, and how Don Quixote was now,
like a loyal knight-errant, returning to keep his promise of retiring to
his village for a year, by which time, said the bachelor, he might perhaps
be cured of his madness; for that was the object that had led him to adopt
these disguises, as it was a sad thing for a gentleman of such good parts
as Don Quixote to be a madman. And so he took his leave of the duke, and
went home to his village to wait there for Don Quixote, who was coming
after him. Thereupon the duke seized the opportunity of practising this
mystification upon him; so much did he enjoy everything connected with
Sancho and Don Quixote. He had the roads about the castle far and near,
everywhere he thought Don Quixote was likely to pass on his return,
occupied by large numbers of his servants on foot and on horseback, who
were to bring him to the castle, by fair means or foul, if they met him.
They did meet him, and sent word to the duke, who, having already settled
what was to be done, as soon as he heard of his arrival, ordered the
torches and lamps in the court to be lit and Altisidora to be placed on
the catafalque with all the pomp and ceremony that has been described, the
whole affair being so well arranged and acted that it differed but little
from reality. And Cide Hamete says, moreover, that for his part he
considers the concocters of the joke as crazy as the victims of it, and
that the duke and duchess were not two fingers’ breadth removed from
being something like fools themselves when they took such pains to make
game of a pair of fools.
</p>
<p>
As for the latter, one was sleeping soundly and the other lying awake
occupied with his desultory thoughts, when daylight came to them bringing
with it the desire to rise; for the lazy down was never a delight to Don
Quixote, victor or vanquished. Altisidora, come back from death to life as
Don Quixote fancied, following up the freak of her lord and lady, entered
the chamber, crowned with the garland she had worn on the catafalque and
in a robe of white taffeta embroidered with gold flowers, her hair flowing
loose over her shoulders, and leaning upon a staff of fine black ebony.
Don Quixote, disconcerted and in confusion at her appearance, huddled
himself up and well-nigh covered himself altogether with the sheets and
counterpane of the bed, tongue-tied, and unable to offer her any civility.
Altisidora seated herself on a chair at the head of the bed, and, after a
deep sigh, said to him in a feeble, soft voice, “When women of rank
and modest maidens trample honour under foot, and give a loose to the
tongue that breaks through every impediment, publishing abroad the inmost
secrets of their hearts, they are reduced to sore extremities. Such a one
am I, Señor Don Quixote of La Mancha, crushed, conquered, love-smitten,
but yet patient under suffering and virtuous, and so much so that my heart
broke with grief and I lost my life. For the last two days I have been
dead, slain by the thought of the cruelty with which thou hast treated me,
obdurate knight,
</p>
<p class="poem">
O harder thou than marble to my plaint;
</p>
<p class="noindent">
or at least believed to be dead by all who saw me; and had it not been
that Love, taking pity on me, let my recovery rest upon the sufferings of
this good squire, there I should have remained in the other world.”
</p>
<p>
“Love might very well have let it rest upon the sufferings of my
ass, and I should have been obliged to him,” said Sancho. “But
tell me, señora—and may heaven send you a tenderer lover than my
master—what did you see in the other world? What goes on in hell?
For of course that’s where one who dies in despair is bound for.”
</p>
<p>
“To tell you the truth,” said Altisidora, “I cannot have
died outright, for I did not go into hell; had I gone in, it is very
certain I should never have come out again, do what I might. The truth is,
I came to the gate, where some dozen or so of devils were playing tennis,
all in breeches and doublets, with falling collars trimmed with Flemish
bonelace, and ruffles of the same that served them for wristbands, with
four fingers’ breadth of the arms exposed to make their hands look
longer; in their hands they held rackets of fire; but what amazed me still
more was that books, apparently full of wind and rubbish, served them for
tennis balls, a strange and marvellous thing; this, however, did not
astonish me so much as to observe that, although with players it is usual
for the winners to be glad and the losers sorry, there in that game all
were growling, all were snarling, and all were cursing one another.”
“That’s no wonder,” said Sancho; “for devils,
whether playing or not, can never be content, win or lose.”
</p>
<p>
“Very likely,” said Altisidora; “but there is another
thing that surprises me too, I mean surprised me then, and that was that
no ball outlasted the first throw or was of any use a second time; and it
was wonderful the constant succession there was of books, new and old. To
one of them, a brand-new, well-bound one, they gave such a stroke that
they knocked the guts out of it and scattered the leaves about. ‘Look
what book that is,’ said one devil to another, and the other
replied, ‘It is the “Second Part of the History of Don Quixote
of La Mancha,” not by Cide Hamete, the original author, but by an
Aragonese who by his own account is of Tordesillas.’ ‘Out of
this with it,’ said the first, ‘and into the depths of hell
with it out of my sight.’ ‘Is it so bad?’ said the
other. ‘So bad is it,’ said the first, ‘that if I had
set myself deliberately to make a worse, I could not have done it.’
They then went on with their game, knocking other books about; and I,
having heard them mention the name of Don Quixote whom I love and adore
so, took care to retain this vision in my memory.”
</p>
<p>
“A vision it must have been, no doubt,” said Don Quixote,
“for there is no other I in the world; this history has been going
about here for some time from hand to hand, but it does not stay long in
any, for everybody gives it a taste of his foot. I am not disturbed by
hearing that I am wandering in a fantastic shape in the darkness of the
pit or in the daylight above, for I am not the one that history treats of.
“Thou art indeed the greatest glutton in the world, Sancho,”
If it should be good, faithful, and true, it will have ages of life; but
if it should be bad, from its birth to its burial will not be a very long
journey.”
</p>
<p>
Altisidora was about to proceed with her complaint against Don Quixote, when he
said to her, “I have several times told you, señora, that it grieves me
said, “If I could make use of my weapons, and my promise had not
you should have set your affections upon me, as from mine they can only receive
gratitude, but no return. I was born to belong to Dulcinea del Toboso, and the
fates, if there are any, dedicated me to her; and to suppose that any other
beauty can take the place she occupies in my heart is to suppose an
impossibility. This frank declaration should suffice to make you retire within
the bounds of your modesty, for no one can bind himself to do
impossibilities.”
</p>
<p>
Hearing this, Altisidora, with a show of anger and agitation, exclaimed,
“God’s life! Don Stockfish, soul of a mortar, stone of a date,
more obstinate and obdurate than a clown asked a favour when he has his
mind made up, if I fall upon you I’ll tear your eyes out! Do you
fancy, Don Vanquished, Don Cudgelled, that I died for your sake? All that
you have seen to-night has been make-believe; I’m not the woman to
let the black of my nail suffer for such a camel, much less die!”
</p>
<p>
“That I can well believe,” said Sancho; “for all that
about lovers pining to death is absurd; they may talk of it, but as for
doing it—Judas may believe that!”
</p>
<p>
While they were talking, the musician, singer, and poet, who had sung the
two stanzas given above came in, and making a profound obeisance to Don
Quixote said, “Will your worship, sir knight, reckon and retain me
in the number of your most faithful servants, for I have long been a great
admirer of yours, as well because of your fame as because of your
achievements?” “Will your worship tell me who you are,”
replied Don Quixote, “so that my courtesy may be answerable to your
deserts?” The young man replied that he was the musician and
songster of the night before. “Of a truth,” said Don Quixote,
“your worship has a most excellent voice; but what you sang did not
seem to me very much to the purpose; for what have Garcilasso’s
stanzas to do with the death of this lady?”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t be surprised at that,” returned the musician;
“for with the callow poets of our day the way is for every one to
write as he pleases and pilfer where he chooses, whether it be germane to
the matter or not, and now-a-days there is no piece of silliness they can
sing or write that is not set down to poetic licence.”
</p>
<p>
Don Quixote was about to reply, but was prevented by the duke and duchess,
who came in to see him, and with them there followed a long and delightful
conversation, in the course of which Sancho said so many droll and saucy
things that he left the duke and duchess wondering not only at his
simplicity but at his sharpness. Don Quixote begged their permission to
take his departure that same day, inasmuch as for a vanquished knight like
himself it was fitter he should live in a pig-sty than in a royal palace.
They gave it very readily, and the duchess asked him if Altisidora was in
his good graces.
</p>
<p>
He replied, “Señora, let me tell your ladyship that this damsel’s
ailment comes entirely of idleness, and the cure for it is honest and
constant employment. She herself has told me that lace is worn in hell;
and as she must know how to make it, let it never be out of her hands; for
when she is occupied in shifting the bobbins to and fro, the image or
images of what she loves will not shift to and fro in her thoughts; this
is the truth, this is my opinion, and this is my advice.”
</p>
<p>
“And mine,” added Sancho; “for I never in all my life
saw a lace-maker that died for love; when damsels are at work their minds
are more set on finishing their tasks than on thinking of their loves. I
speak from my own experience; for when I’m digging I never think of
my old woman; I mean my Teresa Panza, whom I love better than my own
eyelids.” “You say well, Sancho,” said the duchess,
“and I will take care that my Altisidora employs herself
henceforward in needlework of some sort; for she is extremely expert at
it.” “There is no occasion to have recourse to that remedy,
señora,” said Altisidora; “for the mere thought of the cruelty
with which this vagabond villain has treated me will suffice to blot him
out of my memory without any other device; with your highness’s
leave I will retire, not to have before my eyes, I won’t say his
rueful countenance, but his abominable, ugly looks.” “That
reminds me of the common saying, that ‘he that rails is ready to
forgive,’” said the duke.
</p>
<p>
Altisidora then, pretending to wipe away her tears with a handkerchief,
made an obeisance to her master and mistress and quitted the room.
</p>
<p>
“Ill luck betide thee, poor damsel,” said Sancho, “ill
luck betide thee! Thou hast fallen in with a soul as dry as a rush and a
heart as hard as oak; had it been me, i’faith ‘another cock
would have crowed to thee.’”
</p>
<p>
So the conversation came to an end, and Don Quixote dressed himself and
dined with the duke and duchess, and set out the same evening.

</p>
<p>
The vanquished and afflicted Don Quixote went along very downcast in one
respect and very happy in another. His sadness arose from his defeat, and
his satisfaction from the thought of the virtue that lay in Sancho, as had
been proved by the resurrection of Altisidora; though it was with
difficulty he could persuade himself that the love-smitten damsel had been
really dead. Sancho went along anything but cheerful, for it grieved him
that Altisidora had not kept her promise of giving him the smocks; and
turning this over in his mind he said to his master, “Surely, señor,
I’m the most unlucky doctor in the world; there’s many a
physician that, after killing the sick man he had to cure, requires to be
paid for his work, though it is only signing a bit of a list of medicines,
that the apothecary and not he makes up, and, there, his labour is over;
but with me though to cure somebody else costs me drops of blood, smacks,
pinches, pinproddings, and whippings, nobody gives me a farthing. Well, I
swear by all that’s good if they put another patient into my hands,
they’ll have to grease them for me before I cure him; for, as they
say, ‘it’s by his singing the abbot gets his dinner,’
and I’m not going to believe that heaven has bestowed upon me the
virtue I have, that I should be dealing it out to others all for nothing.”
</p>
<p>
“Thou art right, Sancho my friend,” said Don Quixote, “and
Altisidora has behaved very badly in not giving thee the smocks she
promised; and although that virtue of thine is <i>gratis data</i>—as it has
cost thee no study whatever, any more than such study as thy personal
sufferings may be—I can say for myself that if thou wouldst have
payment for the lashes on account of the disenchant of Dulcinea, I would
have given it to thee freely ere this. I am not sure, however, whether
payment will comport with the cure, and I would not have the reward
interfere with the medicine. I think there will be nothing lost by trying
it; consider how much thou wouldst have, Sancho, and whip thyself at once,
and pay thyself down with thine own hand, as thou hast money of mine.”
</p>
<p>
At this proposal Sancho opened his eyes and his ears a palm’s
breadth wide, and in his heart very readily acquiesced in whipping
himself, and said he to his master, “Very well then, señor, I’ll
hold myself in readiness to gratify your worship’s wishes if I’m
to profit by it; for the love of my wife and children forces me to seem
grasping. Let your worship say how much you will pay me for each lash I
give myself.”
</p>
<p>
“If Sancho,” replied Don Quixote, “I were to requite
thee as the importance and nature of the cure deserves, the treasures of
Venice, the mines of Potosi, would be insufficient to pay thee. See what
thou hast of mine, and put a price on each lash.”
</p>
<p>
“Of them,” said Sancho, “there are three thousand three
hundred and odd; of these I have given myself five, the rest remain; let
the five go for the odd ones, and let us take the three thousand three
hundred, which at a quarter real apiece (for I will not take less though
the whole world should bid me) make three thousand three hundred quarter
reals; the three thousand are one thousand five hundred half reals, which
make seven hundred and fifty reals; and the three hundred make a hundred
and fifty half reals, which come to seventy-five reals, which added to the
seven hundred and fifty make eight hundred and twenty-five reals in all.
These I will stop out of what I have belonging to your worship, and I’ll
return home rich and content, though well whipped, for ‘there’s
no taking trout’—but I say no more.”
</p>
<p>
“O blessed Sancho! O dear Sancho!” said Don Quixote; “how
we shall be bound to serve thee, Dulcinea and I, all the days of our lives
that heaven may grant us! If she returns to her lost shape (and it cannot
be but that she will) her misfortune will have been good fortune, and my
defeat a most happy triumph. But look here, Sancho; when wilt thou begin
the scourging? For if thou wilt make short work of it, I will give thee a
hundred reals over and above.”
</p>
<p>
“When?” said Sancho; “this night without fail. Let your
worship order it so that we pass it out of doors and in the open air, and
I’ll scarify myself.”
</p>
<p>
Night, longed for by Don Quixote with the greatest anxiety in the world,
came at last, though it seemed to him that the wheels of Apollo’s
car had broken down, and that the day was drawing itself out longer than
usual, just as is the case with lovers, who never make the reckoning of
their desires agree with time. They made their way at length in among some
pleasant trees that stood a little distance from the road, and there
vacating Rocinante’s saddle and Dapple’s pack-saddle, they
stretched themselves on the green grass and made their supper off Sancho’s
stores, and he making a powerful and flexible whip out of Dapple’s
halter and headstall retreated about twenty paces from his master among
some beech trees. Don Quixote seeing him march off with such resolution
and spirit, said to him, “Take care, my friend, not to cut thyself
to pieces; allow the lashes to wait for one another, and do not be in so
great a hurry as to run thyself out of breath midway; I mean, do not lay
on so strenuously as to make thy life fail thee before thou hast reached
the desired number; and that thou mayest not lose by a card too much or
too little, I will station myself apart and count on my rosary here the
lashes thou givest thyself. May heaven help thee as thy good intention
deserves.”
</p>
<p>
“‘Pledges don’t distress a good payer,’”
said Sancho; “I mean to lay on in such a way as without killing
myself to hurt myself, for in that, no doubt, lies the essence of this
miracle.”
</p>
<p>
He then stripped himself from the waist upwards, and snatching up the rope
he began to lay on and Don Quixote to count the lashes. He might have
given himself six or eight when he began to think the joke no trifle, and
its price very low; and holding his hand for a moment, he told his master
that he cried off on the score of a blind bargain, for each of those
lashes ought to be paid for at the rate of half a real instead of a
quarter.
</p>
<p>
“Go on, Sancho my friend, and be not disheartened,” said Don
Quixote; “for I double the stakes as to price.”
</p>
<p>
“In that case,” said Sancho, “in God’s hand be it,
and let it rain lashes.” But the rogue no longer laid them on his
shoulders, but laid on to the trees, with such groans every now and then,
that one would have thought at each of them his soul was being plucked up
by the roots. Don Quixote, touched to the heart, and fearing he might make
an end of himself, and that through Sancho’s imprudence he might
miss his own object, said to him, “As thou livest, my friend, let
the matter rest where it is, for the remedy seems to me a very rough one,
and it will be well to have patience; ‘Zamora was not won in an
hour.’ If I have not reckoned wrong thou hast given thyself over a
thousand lashes; that is enough for the present; ‘for the ass,’
to put it in homely phrase, ‘bears the load, but not the overload.’”
</p>
<p>
“No, no, señor,” replied Sancho; “it shall never be said
of me, ‘The money paid, the arms broken;’ go back a little
further, your worship, and let me give myself at any rate a thousand
lashes more; for in a couple of bouts like this we shall have finished off
the lot, and there will be even cloth to spare.”
</p>
<p>
“As thou art in such a willing mood,” said Don Quixote,
“may heaven aid thee; lay on and I’ll retire.”
</p>
<p>
Sancho returned to his task with so much resolution that he soon had the
bark stripped off several trees, such was the severity with which he
whipped himself; and one time, raising his voice, and giving a beech a
tremendous lash, he cried out, “Here dies Samson, and all with him!”
</p>
<p>

</p>
<div class="fig" style="width:60%;">

</p>
<p>
At the sound of his piteous cry and of the stroke of the cruel lash, Don
Quixote ran to him at once, and seizing the twisted halter that served him
for a courbash, said to him, “Heaven forbid, Sancho my friend, that
to please me thou shouldst lose thy life, which is needed for the support
of thy wife and children; let Dulcinea wait for a better opportunity, and
I will content myself with a hope soon to be realised, and have patience
until thou hast gained fresh strength so as to finish off this business to
the satisfaction of everybody.”
</p>
<p>
“As your worship will have it so, señor,” said Sancho, “so
be it; but throw your cloak over my shoulders, for I’m sweating and
I don’t want to take cold; it’s a risk that novice
disciplinants run.”
</p>
<p>
Don Quixote obeyed, and stripping himself covered Sancho, who slept until
the sun woke him; they then resumed their journey, which for the time
being they brought to an end at a village that lay three leagues farther
on. They dismounted at a hostelry which Don Quixote recognised as such and
did not take to be a castle with moat, turrets, portcullis, and
drawbridge; for ever since he had been vanquished he talked more
rationally about everything, as will be shown presently. They quartered
him in a room on the ground floor, where in place of leather hangings
there were pieces of painted serge such as they commonly use in villages.
On one of them was painted by some very poor hand the Rape of Helen, when
the bold guest carried her off from Menelaus, and on the other was the
story of Dido and Æneas, she on a high tower, as though she were making
signals with a half sheet to her fugitive guest who was out at sea flying
in a frigate or brigantine. He noticed in the two stories that Helen did
not go very reluctantly, for she was laughing slyly and roguishly; but the
fair Dido was shown dropping tears the size of walnuts from her eyes. Don
Quixote as he looked at them observed, “Those two ladies were very
unfortunate not to have been born in this age, and I unfortunate above all
men not to have been born in theirs. Had I fallen in with those gentlemen,
Troy would not have been burned or Carthage destroyed, for it would have
been only for me to slay Paris, and all these misfortunes would have been
avoided.”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll lay a bet,” said Sancho, “that before long
there won’t be a tavern, roadside inn, hostelry, or barber’s
shop where the story of our doings won’t be painted up; but I’d
</div>
like it painted by the hand of a better painter than painted these.”
</p>
<p>
“Thou art right, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “for this
painter is like Orbaneja, a painter there was at Úbeda, who when they
asked him what he was painting, used to say, ‘Whatever it may turn
out; and if he chanced to paint a cock he would write under it, ‘This
is a cock,’ for fear they might think it was a fox. The painter or
writer, for it’s all the same, who published the history of this new
Don Quixote that has come out, must have been one of this sort I think,
Sancho, for he painted or wrote ‘whatever it might turn out;’
or perhaps he is like a poet called Mauleon that was about the Court some
years ago, who used to answer at haphazard whatever he was asked, and on
one asking him what <i>Deum de Deo</i> meant, he replied <i>Dé donde diere</i>. But,
putting this aside, tell me, Sancho, hast thou a mind to have another turn
at thyself to-night, and wouldst thou rather have it indoors or in the
open air?”
</p>
<p>
“Egad, señor,” said Sancho, “for what I’m going to
give myself, it comes all the same to me whether it is in a house or in
the fields; still I’d like it to be among trees; for I think they
are company for me and help me to bear my pain wonderfully.”
</p>
<p>
“And yet it must not be, Sancho my friend,” said Don Quixote;
“but, to enable thee to recover strength, we must keep it for our
own village; for at the latest we shall get there the day after to-morrow.”
</p>
<p>
Sancho said he might do as he pleased; but that for his own part he would
like to finish off the business quickly before his blood cooled and while
he had an appetite, because “in delay there is apt to be danger”
very often, and “praying to God and plying the hammer,” and
“one take was better than two I’ll give thee’s,”
and “a sparrow in the hand than a vulture on the wing.”
</p>
<p>
“For God’s sake, Sancho, no more proverbs!” exclaimed
Don Quixote; “it seems to me thou art becoming <i>sicut erat</i> again;
speak in a plain, simple, straight-forward way, as I have often told thee,
and thou wilt find the good of it.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know what bad luck it is of mine,” said Sancho,
</p>
“but I can’t utter a word without a proverb that is not as
good as an argument to my mind; however, I mean to mend if I can;”
and so for the present the conversation ended.

</p>
<p>
All that day Don Quixote and Sancho remained in the village and inn
waiting for night, the one to finish off his task of scourging in the open
country, the other to see it accomplished, for therein lay the
accomplishment of his wishes. Meanwhile there arrived at the hostelry a
traveller on horseback with three or four servants, one of whom said to
him who appeared to be the master, “Here, Señor Don Álvaro Tarfe,
your worship may take your siesta to-day; the quarters seem clean and
cool.”
</p>
<p>
When he heard this Don Quixote said to Sancho, “Look here, Sancho;
on turning over the leaves of that book of the Second Part of my history I
think I came casually upon this name of Don Álvaro Tarfe.”
</p>
<p>
“Very likely,” said Sancho; “we had better let him
dismount, and by-and-by we can ask about it.”
</p>
<p>
The gentleman dismounted, and the landlady gave him a room on the ground
floor opposite Don Quixote’s and adorned with painted serge hangings
of the same sort. The newly arrived gentleman put on a summer coat, and
coming out to the gateway of the hostelry, which was wide and cool,
addressing Don Quixote, who was pacing up and down there, he asked,
“In what direction is your worship bound, gentle sir?”
</p>
<p>
“To a village near this which is my own village,” replied Don
Quixote; “and your worship, where are you bound for?”
</p>
<p>
“I am going to Granada, señor,” said the gentleman, “to
my own country.”
</p>
<p>
“And a goodly country,” said Don Quixote; “but will your
worship do me the favour of telling me your name, for it strikes me it is
of more importance to me to know it than I can tell you.”
</p>
<p>
“My name is Don Álvaro Tarfe,” replied the traveller.
</p>
<p>
To which Don Quixote returned, “I have no doubt whatever that your
worship is that Don Álvaro Tarfe who appears in print in the Second Part
of the history of Don Quixote of La Mancha, lately printed and published
by a new author.”
</p>
<p>
“I am the same,” replied the gentleman; “and that same
Don Quixote, the principal personage in the said history, was a very great
friend of mine, and it was I who took him away from home, or at least
induced him to come to some jousts that were to be held at Saragossa,
whither I was going myself; indeed, I showed him many kindnesses, and
saved him from having his shoulders touched up by the executioner because
of his extreme rashness.”
</p>
<p>
“Tell me, Señor Don Álvaro,” said Don Quixote, “am I at
all like that Don Quixote you talk of?”
</p>
<p>
“No indeed,” replied the traveller, “not a bit.”
</p>
<p>
“And that Don Quixote—” said our one, “had he with him
a squire called Sancho Panza?”
</p>
<p>
“He had,” said Don Álvaro; “but though he had the name
of being very droll, I never heard him say anything that had any drollery
in it.”
</p>
<p>
“That I can well believe,” said Sancho at this, “for to
come out with drolleries is not in everybody’s line; and that Sancho
your worship speaks of, gentle sir, must be some great scoundrel,
dunderhead, and thief, all in one; for I am the real Sancho Panza, and I
have more drolleries than if it rained them; let your worship only try;
come along with me for a year or so, and you will find they fall from me
at every turn, and so rich and so plentiful that though mostly I don’t
know what I am saying I make everybody that hears me laugh. And the real
Don Quixote of La Mancha, the famous, the valiant, the wise, the lover,
the righter of wrongs, the guardian of minors and orphans, the protector
of widows, the killer of damsels, he who has for his sole mistress the
peerless Dulcinea del Toboso, is this gentleman before you, my master; all
other Don Quixotes and all other Sancho Panzas are dreams and mockeries.”
</p>
<p>
“By God I believe it,” said Don Álvaro; “for you have
uttered more drolleries, my friend, in the few words you have spoken than
the other Sancho Panza in all I ever heard from him, and they were not a
few. He was more greedy than well-spoken, and more dull than droll; and I
am convinced that the enchanters who persecute Don Quixote the Good have
been trying to persecute me with Don Quixote the Bad. But I don’t
know what to say, for I am ready to swear I left him shut up in the Casa
del Nuncio at Toledo, and here another Don Quixote turns up, though a very
different one from mine.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know whether I am good,” said Don Quixote,
“but I can safely say I am not ‘the Bad;’ and to prove
it, let me tell you, Señor Don Álvaro Tarfe, I have never in my life been
in Saragossa; so far from that, when it was told me that this imaginary
Don Quixote had been present at the jousts in that city, I declined to
enter it, in order to drag his falsehood before the face of the world; and
so I went on straight to Barcelona, the treasure-house of courtesy, haven
of strangers, asylum of the poor, home of the valiant, champion of the
wronged, pleasant exchange of firm friendships, and city unrivalled in
site and beauty. And though the adventures that befell me there are not by
any means matters of enjoyment, but rather of regret, I do not regret
them, simply because I have seen it. In a word, Señor Don Álvaro Tarfe, I
am Don Quixote of La Mancha, the one that fame speaks of, and not the
unlucky one that has attempted to usurp my name and deck himself out in my
ideas. I entreat your worship by your devoir as a gentleman to be so good
as to make a declaration before the alcalde of this village that you never
in all your life saw me until now, and that neither am I the Don Quixote
in print in the Second Part, nor this Sancho Panza, my squire, the one
your worship knew.”
</p>
<p>
“That I will do most willingly,” replied Don Álvaro; “though
it amazes me to find two Don Quixotes and two Sancho Panzas at once, as
much alike in name as they differ in demeanour; and again I say and
declare that what I saw I cannot have seen, and that what happened me
cannot have happened.”
</p>
<p>
“No doubt your worship is enchanted, like my lady Dulcinea del
Toboso,” said Sancho; “and would to heaven your disenchantment
rested on my giving myself another three thousand and odd lashes like what
I’m giving myself for her, for I’d lay them on without looking
for anything.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t understand that about the lashes,” said Don
Álvaro. Sancho replied that it was a long story to tell, but he would tell
him if they happened to be going the same road.
</p>
<p>
By this dinner-time arrived, and Don Quixote and Don Álvaro dined
together. The alcalde of the village came by chance into the inn together
with a notary, and Don Quixote laid a petition before him, showing that it
was requisite for his rights that Don Álvaro Tarfe, the gentleman there
present, should make a declaration before him that he did not know Don
Quixote of La Mancha, also there present, and that he was not the one that
was in print in a history entitled “Second Part of Don Quixote of La
Mancha, by one Avellaneda of Tordesillas.” The alcalde finally put
it in legal form, and the declaration was made with all the formalities
required in such cases, at which Don Quixote and Sancho were in high
delight, as if a declaration of the sort was of any great importance to
them, and as if their words and deeds did not plainly show the difference
between the two Don Quixotes and the two Sanchos. Many civilities and
offers of service were exchanged by Don Álvaro and Don Quixote, in the
course of which the great Manchegan displayed such good taste that he
disabused Don Álvaro of the error he was under; and he, on his part, felt
convinced he must have been enchanted, now that he had been brought in
contact with two such opposite Don Quixotes.
</p>
<p>
Evening came, they set out from the village, and after about half a league
two roads branched off, one leading to Don Quixote’s village, the
other the road Don Álvaro was to follow. In this short interval Don
Quixote told him of his unfortunate defeat, and of Dulcinea’s
enchantment and the remedy, all which threw Don Álvaro into fresh
amazement, and embracing Don Quixote and Sancho, he went his way, and Don
Quixote went his. That night he passed among trees again in order to give
Sancho an opportunity of working out his penance, which he did in the same
fashion as the night before, at the expense of the bark of the beech trees
much more than of his back, of which he took such good care that the
lashes would not have knocked off a fly had there been one there. The
duped Don Quixote did not miss a single stroke of the count, and he found
that together with those of the night before they made up three thousand
and twenty-nine. The sun apparently had got up early to witness the
sacrifice, and with his light they resumed their journey, discussing the
deception practised on Don Álvaro, and saying how well done it was to have
taken his declaration before a magistrate in such an unimpeachable form.
That day and night they travelled on, nor did anything worth mention
happen to them, unless it was that in the course of the night Sancho
finished off his task, whereat Don Quixote was beyond measure joyful. He
watched for daylight, to see if along the road he should fall in with his
already disenchanted lady Dulcinea; and as he pursued his journey there
was no woman he met that he did not go up to, to see if she was Dulcinea
del Toboso, as he held it absolutely certain that Merlin’s promises
could not lie. Full of these thoughts and anxieties, they ascended a
rising ground wherefrom they descried their own village, at the sight of
which Sancho fell on his knees exclaiming, “Open thine eyes,
longed-for home, and see how thy son Sancho Panza comes back to thee, if
not very rich, very well whipped! Open thine arms and receive, too, thy
son Don Quixote, who, if he comes vanquished by the arm of another, comes
victor over himself, which, as he himself has told me, is the greatest
victory anyone can desire. I’m bringing back money, for if I was
well whipped, I went mounted like a gentleman.”

</p>
<p>
“Have done with these fooleries,” said Don Quixote; “let
us push on straight and get to our own place, where we will give free
range to our fancies, and settle our plans for our future pastoral life.”
</p>
<p>
With this they descended the slope and directed their steps to their
village.

</p>
<p>
At the entrance of the village, so says Cide Hamete, Don Quixote saw two
boys quarrelling on the village threshing-floor, one of whom said to the
other, “Take it easy, Periquillo; thou shalt never see it again as
long as thou livest.”
</p>
<p>
Don Quixote heard this, and said he to Sancho, “Dost thou not mark,
friend, what that boy said, ‘Thou shalt never see it again as long
as thou livest’?”
</p>
<p>
“Well,” said Sancho, “what does it matter if the boy
said so?”
</p>
<p>
“What!” said Don Quixote, “dost thou not see that,
applied to the object of my desires, the words mean that I am never to see
Dulcinea more?”
</p>
<p>
Sancho was about to answer, when his attention was diverted by seeing a hare
come flying across the plain pursued by several greyhounds and sportsmen. In
its terror it ran to take shelter and hide itself under Dapple. Sancho caught
it alive and presented it to Don Quixote, who was saying, “<i>Malum
signum, malum signum!</i> a hare flies, greyhounds chase it, Dulcinea appears
not.”
</p>
<p>
“Your worship’s a strange man,” said Sancho; “let’s
take it for granted that this hare is Dulcinea, and these greyhounds
chasing it the malignant enchanters who turned her into a country wench;
she flies, and I catch her and put her into your worship’s hands,
and you hold her in your arms and cherish her; what bad sign is that, or
what ill omen is there to be found here?”
</p>
<p>
The two boys who had been quarrelling came over to look at the hare, and
Sancho asked one of them what their quarrel was about. He was answered by
the one who had said, “Thou shalt never see it again as long as thou
livest,” that he had taken a cage full of crickets from the other
boy, and did not mean to give it back to him as long as he lived. Sancho
took out four cuartos from his pocket and gave them to the boy for the
cage, which he placed in Don Quixote’s hands, saying, “There,
señor! there are the omens broken and destroyed, and they have no more to
do with our affairs, to my thinking, fool as I am, than with last year’s
clouds; and if I remember rightly I have heard the curate of our village
say that it does not become Christians or sensible people to give any heed
to these silly things; and even you yourself said the same to me some time
ago, telling me that all Christians who minded omens were fools; but there’s
no need of making words about it; let us push on and go into our village.”
</p>
<p>
The sportsmen came up and asked for their hare, which Don Quixote gave
them. They then went on, and upon the green at the entrance of the town
they came upon the curate and the bachelor Samson Carrasco busy with their
breviaries. It should be mentioned that Sancho had thrown, by way of a
sumpter-cloth, over Dapple and over the bundle of armour, the buckram robe
painted with flames which they had put upon him at the duke’s castle
the night Altisidora came back to life. He had also fixed the mitre on
Dapple’s head, the oddest transformation and decoration that ever
ass in the world underwent. They were at once recognised by both the
curate and the bachelor, who came towards them with open arms. Don Quixote
dismounted and received them with a close embrace; and the boys, who are
lynxes that nothing escapes, spied out the ass’s mitre and came
running to see it, calling out to one another, “Come here, boys, and
see Sancho Panza’s ass figged out finer than Mingo, and Don Quixote’s
beast leaner than ever.”
</p>
<p>
So at length, with the boys capering round them, and accompanied by the
curate and the bachelor, they made their entrance into the town, and
proceeded to Don Quixote’s house, at the door of which they found
his housekeeper and niece, whom the news of his arrival had already
reached. It had been brought to Teresa Panza, Sancho’s wife, as
well, and she with her hair all loose and half naked, dragging Sanchica
her daughter by the hand, ran out to meet her husband; but seeing him
coming in by no means as good case as she thought a governor ought to be,
she said to him, “How is it you come this way, husband? It seems to
me you come tramping and footsore, and looking more like a disorderly
vagabond than a governor.”
</p>
<p>
“Hold your tongue, Teresa,” said Sancho; “often ‘where
there are pegs there are no flitches;’ let’s go into the house
and there you’ll hear strange things. I bring money, and that’s
the main thing, got by my own industry without wronging anybody.”
</p>
<p>
“You bring the money, my good husband,” said Teresa, “and
no matter whether it was got this way or that; for, however you may have
got it, you’ll not have brought any new practice into the world.”
</p>
<p>
Sanchica embraced her father and asked him if he brought her anything, for
she had been looking out for him as for the showers of May; and she taking
hold of him by the girdle on one side, and his wife by the hand, while the
daughter led Dapple, they made for their house, leaving Don Quixote in
his, in the hands of his niece and housekeeper, and in the company of the
curate and the bachelor.
</p>
<p>
Don Quixote at once, without any regard to time or season, withdrew in
private with the bachelor and the curate, and in a few words told them of
his defeat, and of the engagement he was under not to quit his village for
a year, which he meant to keep to the letter without departing a hair’s
breadth from it, as became a knight-errant bound by scrupulous good faith
and the laws of knight-errantry; and of how he thought of turning shepherd
for that year, and taking his diversion in the solitude of the fields,
where he could with perfect freedom give range to his thoughts of love
while he followed the virtuous pastoral calling; and he besought them, if
they had not a great deal to do and were not prevented by more important
business, to consent to be his companions, for he would buy sheep enough
to qualify them for shepherds; and the most important point of the whole
affair, he could tell them, was settled, for he had given them names that
would fit them to a T. The curate asked what they were. Don Quixote
replied that he himself was to be called the shepherd Quixotize and the
bachelor the shepherd Carrascon, and the curate the shepherd Curambro, and
Sancho Panza the shepherd Pancino.
</p>
<p>
Both were astounded at Don Quixote’s new craze; however, lest he
should once more make off out of the village from them in pursuit of his
chivalry, they trusting that in the course of the year he might be cured,
fell in with his new project, applauded his crazy idea as a bright one,
and offered to share the life with him. “And what’s more,”
said Samson Carrasco, “I am, as all the world knows, a very famous
poet, and I’ll be always making verses, pastoral, or courtly, or as
it may come into my head, to pass away our time in those secluded regions
where we shall be roaming. But what is most needful, sirs, is that each of
us should choose the name of the shepherdess he means to glorify in his
verses, and that we should not leave a tree, be it ever so hard, without
writing up and carving her name on it, as is the habit and custom of
love-smitten shepherds.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s the very thing,” said Don Quixote; “though
I am relieved from looking for the name of an imaginary shepherdess, for
there’s the peerless Dulcinea del Toboso, the glory of these
brooksides, the ornament of these meadows, the mainstay of beauty, the
cream of all the graces, and, in a word, the being to whom all praise is
appropriate, be it ever so hyperbolical.”
</p>
<p>
“Very true,” said the curate; “but we the others must
look about for accommodating shepherdesses that will answer our purpose
one way or another.”
</p>
<p>
“And,” added Samson Carrasco, “if they fail us, we can
call them by the names of the ones in print that the world is filled with,
Fílidas, Amarilises, Dianas, Fleridas, Galateas, Belisardas; for as they
sell them in the market-places we may fairly buy them and make them our
own. If my lady, or I should say my shepherdess, happens to be called Ana,
I’ll sing her praises under the name of Anarda, and if Francisca, I’ll
call her Francenia, and if Lucia, Lucinda, for it all comes to the same
thing; and Sancho Panza, if he joins this fraternity, may glorify his wife
Teresa Panza as Teresaina.”
</p>
<p>
Don Quixote laughed at the adaptation of the name, and the curate bestowed
vast praise upon the worthy and honourable resolution he had made, and
again offered to bear him company all the time that he could spare from
his imperative duties. And so they took their leave of him, recommending
and beseeching him to take care of his health and treat himself to a
suitable diet.
</p>
<p>
It so happened his niece and the housekeeper overheard all the three of
them said; and as soon as they were gone they both of them came in to Don
Quixote, and said the niece, “What’s this, uncle? Now that we
were thinking you had come back to stay at home and lead a quiet
respectable life there, are you going to get into fresh entanglements, and
turn ‘young shepherd, thou that comest here, young shepherd going
there?’ Nay! indeed ‘the straw is too hard now to make pipes
of.’”
</p>
<p>
“And,” added the housekeeper, “will your worship be able
to bear, out in the fields, the heats of summer, and the chills of winter,
and the howling of the wolves? Not you; for that’s a life and a
business for hardy men, bred and seasoned to such work almost from the
time they were in swaddling-clothes. Why, to make choice of evils, it’s
better to be a knight-errant than a shepherd! Look here, señor; take my
advice—and I’m not giving it to you full of bread and wine, but
fasting, and with fifty years upon my head—stay at home, look after your
affairs, go often to confession, be good to the poor, and upon my soul be
it if any evil comes to you.”
</p>
<p>
“Hold your peace, my daughters,” said Don Quixote; “I
know very well what my duty is; help me to bed, for I don’t feel
very well; and rest assured that, knight-errant now or wandering shepherd
to be, I shall never fail to have a care for your interests, as you will
see in the end.” And the good wenches (for that they undoubtedly
were), the housekeeper and niece, helped him to bed, where they gave him
something to eat and made him as comfortable as possible.

</p>
<p>
As nothing that is man’s can last for ever, but all tends ever
downwards from its beginning to its end, and above all man’s life,
and as Don Quixote’s enjoyed no special dispensation from heaven to
stay its course, its end and close came when he least looked for it.
For—whether it was of the dejection the thought of his defeat produced,
or of heaven’s will that so ordered it—a fever settled upon him and
kept him in his bed for six days, during which he was often visited by his
friends the curate, the bachelor, and the barber, while his good squire
Sancho Panza never quitted his bedside. They, persuaded that it was grief
at finding himself vanquished, and the object of his heart, the liberation
and disenchantment of Dulcinea, unattained, that kept him in this state,
strove by all the means in their power to cheer him up; the bachelor
bidding him take heart and get up to begin his pastoral life, for which he
himself, he said, had already composed an eclogue that would take the
shine out of all Sannazaro had ever written, and had bought with his own
money two famous dogs to guard the flock, one called Barcino and the other
Butron, which a herdsman of Quintanar had sold him.
</p>
<p>
But for all this Don Quixote could not shake off his sadness. His friends
called in the doctor, who felt his pulse and was not very well satisfied
with it, and said that in any case it would be well for him to attend to
the health of his soul, as that of his body was in a bad way. Don Quixote
heard this calmly; but not so his housekeeper, his niece, and his squire,
who fell weeping bitterly, as if they had him lying dead before them. The
doctor’s opinion was that melancholy and depression were bringing
him to his end. Don Quixote begged them to leave him to himself, as he had
a wish to sleep a little. They obeyed, and he slept at one stretch, as the
saying is, more than six hours, so that the housekeeper and niece thought
he was going to sleep for ever. But at the end of that time he woke up,
and in a loud voice exclaimed, “Blessed be Almighty God, who has
shown me such goodness. In truth his mercies are boundless, and the sins
of men can neither limit them nor keep them back!”
</p>
<p>
The niece listened with attention to her uncle’s words, and they
struck her as more coherent than what usually fell from him, at least
during his illness, so she asked, “What are you saying, señor? Has
anything strange occurred? What mercies or what sins of men are you
talking of?”
</p>
<p>
“The mercies, niece,” said Don Quixote, “are those that
God has this moment shown me, and with him, as I said, my sins are no
impediment to them. My reason is now free and clear, rid of the dark
shadows of ignorance that my unhappy constant study of those detestable
books of chivalry cast over it. Now I see through their absurdities and
deceptions, and it only grieves me that this destruction of my illusions
has come so late that it leaves me no time to make some amends by reading
other books that might be a light to my soul. Niece, I feel myself at the
point of death, and I would fain meet it in such a way as to show that my
life has not been so ill that I should leave behind me the name of a
madman; for though I have been one, I would not that the fact should be
made plainer at my death. Call in to me, my dear, my good friends the
curate, the bachelor Samson Carrasco, and Master Nicholas the barber, for
I wish to confess and make my will.” But his niece was saved the
trouble by the entrance of the three. The instant Don Quixote saw them he
exclaimed, “Good news for you, good sirs, that I am no longer Don
Quixote of La Mancha, but Alonso Quixano, whose way of life won for him
the name of Good. Now am I the enemy of Amadis of Gaul and of the whole
countless troop of his descendants; odious to me now are all the profane
stories of knight-errantry; now I perceive my folly, and the peril into
which reading them brought me; now, by God’s mercy schooled into my
right senses, I loathe them.”
</p>
<p>
When the three heard him speak in this way, they had no doubt whatever
that some new craze had taken possession of him; and said Samson, “What?
Señor Don Quixote! Now that we have intelligence of the lady Dulcinea
being disenchanted, are you taking this line; now, just as we are on the
point of becoming shepherds, to pass our lives singing, like princes, are
you thinking of turning hermit? Hush, for heaven’s sake, be rational
and let’s have no more nonsense.”
</p>
<p>
“All that nonsense,” said Don Quixote, “that until now
has been a reality to my hurt, my death will, with heaven’s help,
turn to my good. I feel, sirs, that I am rapidly drawing near death; a
truce to jesting; let me have a confessor to confess me, and a notary to
make my will; for in extremities like this, man must not trifle with his
soul; and while the curate is confessing me let someone, I beg, go for
the notary.”
</p>
<p>
They looked at one another, wondering at Don Quixote’s words; but,
though uncertain, they were inclined to believe him, and one of the signs
by which they came to the conclusion he was dying was this so sudden and
complete return to his senses after having been mad; for to the words
already quoted he added much more, so well expressed, so devout, and so
rational, as to banish all doubt and convince them that he was sound of
mind. The curate turned them all out, and left alone with him confessed
him. The bachelor went for the notary and returned shortly afterwards with
him and with Sancho, who, having already learned from the bachelor the
condition his master was in, and finding the housekeeper and niece
weeping, began to blubber and shed tears.
</p>
<p>
The confession over, the curate came out saying, “Alonso Quixano the
Good is indeed dying, and is indeed in his right mind; we may now go in to
him while he makes his will.”
</p>
<p>
This news gave a tremendous impulse to the brimming eyes of the
housekeeper, niece, and Sancho Panza his good squire, making the tears
burst from their eyes and a host of sighs from their hearts; for of a
truth, as has been said more than once, whether as plain Alonso Quixano
the Good, or as Don Quixote of La Mancha, Don Quixote was always of a
gentle disposition and kindly in all his ways, and hence he was beloved,
not only by those of his own house, but by all who knew him.
</p>
<p>
The notary came in with the rest, and as soon as the preamble of the will
had been set out and Don Quixote had commended his soul to God with all
the devout formalities that are usual, coming to the bequests, he said,
“Item, it is my will that, touching certain moneys in the hands of
Sancho Panza (whom in my madness I made my squire), inasmuch as between
him and me there have been certain accounts and debits and credits, no
claim be made against him, nor any account demanded of him in respect of
them; but that if anything remain over and above, after he has paid
himself what I owe him, the balance, which will be but little, shall be
his, and much good may it do him; and if, as when I was mad I had a share
in giving him the government of an island, so, now that I am in my senses,
I could give him that of a kingdom, it should be his, for the simplicity
of his character and the fidelity of his conduct deserve it.” And
then, turning to Sancho, he said, “Forgive me, my friend, that I led
thee to seem as mad as myself, making thee fall into the same error I
myself fell into, that there were and still are knights-errant in the
world.”
</p>
<p>
“Ah!” said Sancho weeping, “don’t die, master, but
take my advice and live many years; for the foolishest thing a man can do
in this life is to let himself die without rhyme or reason, without
anybody killing him, or any hands but melancholy’s making an end of
him. Come, don’t be lazy, but get up from your bed and let us take
to the fields in shepherd’s trim as we agreed. Perhaps behind some
bush we shall find the lady Dulcinea disenchanted, as fine as fine can be.
If it be that you are dying of vexation at having been vanquished, lay the
blame on me, and say you were overthrown because I had girthed Rocinante
badly; besides you must have seen in your books of chivalry that it is a
common thing for knights to upset one another, and for him who is
conquered to-day to be conqueror to-morrow.”
</p>
<p>
“Very true,” said Samson, “and good Sancho Panza’s
view of these cases is quite right.”
</p>
<p>
“Sirs, not so fast,” said Don Quixote, “‘in last
year’s nests there are no birds this year.’ I was mad, now I
am in my senses; I was Don Quixote of La Mancha, I am now, as I said,
Alonso Quixano the Good; and may my repentance and sincerity restore me to
the esteem you used to have for me; and now let Master Notary proceed.
</p>
<p>
“Item, I leave all my property absolutely to Antonia Quixana my
niece, here present, after all has been deducted from the most available
portion of it that may be required to satisfy the bequests I have made.
And the first disbursement I desire to be made is the payment of the wages
I owe for the time my housekeeper has served me, with twenty ducats, over
and above, for a gown. The curate and the bachelor Samson Carrasco, now
present, I appoint my executors.
</p>
<p>
“Item, it is my wish that if Antonia Quixana, my niece, desires to
marry, she shall marry a man of whom it shall be first of all ascertained
by information taken that he does not know what books of chivalry are; and
if it should be proved that he does, and if, in spite of this, my niece
insists upon marrying him, and does marry him, then that she shall forfeit
the whole of what I have left her, which my executors shall devote to
works of charity as they please.
</p>
<p>
“Item, I entreat the aforesaid gentlemen my executors, that, if any
happy chance should lead them to discover the author who is said to have
written a history now going about under the title of ‘Second Part of
the Achievements of Don Quixote of La Mancha,’ they beg of him on my
behalf as earnestly as they can to forgive me for having been, without
intending it, the cause of his writing so many and such monstrous
absurdities as he has written in it; for I am leaving the world with a
feeling of compunction at having provoked him to write them.”
</p>
<p>
With this he closed his will, and a faintness coming over him he stretched
himself out at full length on the bed. All were in a flutter and made
haste to relieve him, and during the three days he lived after that on
which he made his will he fainted away very often. The house was all in
confusion; but still the niece ate and the housekeeper drank and Sancho
Panza enjoyed himself; for inheriting property wipes out or softens down
in the heir the feeling of grief the dead man might be expected to leave
behind him.

<p>
At last Don Quixote’s end came, after he had received all the
sacraments, and had in full and forcible terms expressed his detestation
<div style="text-align:center;font-size:0.9em">PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK</div>
of books of chivalry. The notary was there at the time, and he said that
in no book of chivalry had he ever read of any knight-errant dying in his
bed so calmly and so like a Christian as Don Quixote, who amid the tears
and lamentations of all present yielded up his spirit, that is to say
died. On perceiving it the curate begged the notary to bear witness that
Alonso Quixano the Good, commonly called Don Quixote of La Mancha, had
passed away from this present life, and died naturally; and said he
desired this testimony in order to remove the possibility of any other
author save Cide Hamete Benengeli bringing him to life again falsely and
making interminable stories out of his achievements.
</p>
<p>
Such was the end of the Ingenious Gentleman of La Mancha, whose village
Cide Hamete would not indicate precisely, in order to leave all the towns
and villages of La Mancha to contend among themselves for the right to
adopt him and claim him as a son, as the seven cities of Greece contended
for Homer. The lamentations of Sancho and the niece and housekeeper are
omitted here, as well as the new epitaphs upon his tomb; Samson Carrasco,
however, put the following lines:
</p>
<p class="poem">
A doughty gentleman lies here;<br>
A stranger all his life to fear;<br>
Nor in his death could Death prevail,<br>
In that last hour, to make him quail.<br>
<br>
He for the world but little cared;<br>
And at his feats the world was scared;<br>
A crazy man his life he passed,<br>
But in his senses died at last.
</p>
<p>
And said most sage Cide Hamete to his pen, “Rest here, hung up by
this brass wire, upon this shelf, O my pen, whether of skilful make or
clumsy cut I know not; here shalt thou remain long ages hence, unless
presumptuous or malignant story-tellers take thee down to profane thee.
But ere they touch thee warn them, and, as best thou canst, say to them:
</p>
<p class="poem">
Hold off! ye weaklings; hold your hands!<br>
Adventure it let none,<br>
For this emprise, my lord the king,<br>
Was meant for me alone.
</p>
<p>
For me alone was Don Quixote born, and I for him; it was his to act, mine
to write; we two together make but one, notwithstanding and in spite of
that pretended Tordesillesque writer who has ventured or would venture
with his great, coarse, ill-trimmed ostrich quill to write the
achievements of my valiant knight;—no burden for his shoulders, nor
subject for his frozen wit: whom, if perchance thou shouldst come to know
him, thou shalt warn to leave at rest where they lie the weary mouldering
bones of Don Quixote, and not to attempt to carry him off, in opposition
to all the privileges of death, to Old Castile, making him rise from the
grave where in reality and truth he lies stretched at full length,
powerless to make any third expedition or new sally; for the two that he
has already made, so much to the enjoyment and approval of everybody to
whom they have become known, in this as well as in foreign countries, are
quite sufficient for the purpose of turning into ridicule the whole of
those made by the whole set of the knights-errant; and so doing shalt thou
discharge thy Christian calling, giving good counsel to one that bears
ill-will to thee. And I shall remain satisfied, and proud to have been the
first who has ever enjoyed the fruit of his writings as fully as he could
desire; for my desire has been no other than to deliver over to the
detestation of mankind the false and foolish tales of the books of
chivalry, which, thanks to that of my true Don Quixote, are even now
tottering, and doubtless doomed to fall for ever. Farewell.”
