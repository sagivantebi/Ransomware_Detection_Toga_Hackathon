      EXPLANATORY
    </p>
    <p>
      In this book a number of dialects are used, to wit: the Missouri
      negro dialect; the extremest form of the backwoods Southwestern dialect;
      the ordinary &ldquo;Pike County&rdquo; dialect; and four modified
      varieties of this last. The shadings have not been done in a haphazard
      fashion, or by guesswork; but painstakingly, and with the trustworthy
      guidance and support of personal familiarity with these several forms of
      speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      I make this explanation for the reason that without it many readers would
      suppose that all these characters were trying to talk alike and not
      succeeding.

      CHAPTER I.
    </p>
    <p>
      You don&rsquo;t know about me without you have read a book by the name of
      The Adventures of Tom Sawyer; but that ain&rsquo;t no matter. That
      book was made by Mr. Mark Twain, and he told the truth, mainly. There
      was things which he stretched, but mainly he told the truth. That is
      nothing. I never seen anybody but lied one time or another, without
      it was Aunt Polly, or the widow, or maybe Mary. Aunt Polly&mdash;Tom&rsquo;s
      Aunt Polly, she is&mdash;and Mary, and the Widow Douglas is all told about
      in that book, which is mostly a true book, with some stretchers, as I said
      before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the way that the book winds up is this: Tom and me found the
      money that the robbers hid in the cave, and it made us rich. We got
      six thousand dollars apiece&mdash;all gold. It was an awful sight of
      money when it was piled up. Well, Judge Thatcher he took it and put
      it out at interest, and it fetched us a dollar a day apiece all the year
      round&mdash;more than a body could tell what to do with. The Widow
      Douglas she took me for her son, and allowed she would sivilize me; but it
      was rough living in the house all the time, considering how dismal regular
      and decent the widow was in all her ways; and so when I couldn&rsquo;t
      stand it no longer I lit out. I got into my old rags and my
      sugar-hogshead again, and was free and satisfied. But Tom Sawyer he
      hunted me up and said he was going to start a band of robbers, and I might
      join if I would go back to the widow and be respectable. So I went
      back.
    </p>
    <p>
      The widow she cried over me, and called me a poor lost lamb, and she
      called me a lot of other names, too, but she never meant no harm by it.
      She put me in them new clothes again, and I couldn&rsquo;t do nothing but
      sweat and sweat, and feel all cramped up. Well, then, the old thing
      commenced again. The widow rung a bell for supper, and you had to
      come to time. When you got to the table you couldn&rsquo;t go right to
      eating, but you had to wait for the widow to tuck down her head and
      grumble a little over the victuals, though there warn&rsquo;t really
      anything the matter with them,&mdash;that is, nothing only everything was
      cooked by itself. In a barrel of odds and ends it is different;
      things get mixed up, and the juice kind of swaps around, and the things go
      better.
    </p>
    <p>
      After supper she got out her book and learned me about Moses and the
      Bulrushers, and I was in a sweat to find out all about him; but by and by
      she let it out that Moses had been dead a considerable long time; so then
      I didn&rsquo;t care no more about him, because I don&rsquo;t take no stock
      in dead people.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <a name="c01-18" id="c01-18"></a><br /> <br />
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:60%">
      <img alt="c01-18.jpg (67K)" src="images/c01-18.jpg" style="width:100%;" /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Pretty soon I wanted to smoke, and asked the widow to let me. But
      she wouldn&rsquo;t. She said it was a mean practice and wasn&rsquo;t
      clean, and I must try to not do it any more. That is just the way
      with some people. They get down on a thing when they don&rsquo;t
      know nothing about it. Here she was a-bothering about Moses, which
      was no kin to her, and no use to anybody, being gone, you see, yet finding
      a power of fault with me for doing a thing that had some good in it.
      And she took snuff, too; of course that was all right, because she
      done it herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her sister, Miss Watson, a tolerable slim old maid, with goggles on, had
      just come to live with her, and took a set at me now with a spelling-book.
      She worked me middling hard for about an hour, and then the widow made her
      ease up. I couldn&rsquo;t stood it much longer. Then for an
      hour it was deadly dull, and I was fidgety. Miss Watson would say,
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t put your feet up there, Huckleberry;&rdquo; and &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
      scrunch up like that, Huckleberry&mdash;set up straight;&rdquo; and pretty
      soon she would say, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t gap and stretch like that,
      Huckleberry&mdash;why don&rsquo;t you try to behave?&rdquo; Then she
      told me all about the bad place, and I said I wished I was there. She got
      mad then, but I didn&rsquo;t mean no harm. All I wanted was to go
      somewheres; all I wanted was a change, I warn&rsquo;t particular. She
      said it was wicked to say what I said; said she wouldn&rsquo;t say it for
      the whole world; she was going to live so as to go to the good place.
      Well, I couldn&rsquo;t see no advantage in going where she was
      going, so I made up my mind I wouldn&rsquo;t try for it. But I never
      said so, because it would only make trouble, and wouldn&rsquo;t do no
      good.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <a name="c01-19" id="c01-19"></a><br /> <br />
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:60%">
      <img alt="c01-19.jpg (46K)" src="images/c01-19.jpg" style="width:100%;" /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Now she had got a start, and she went on and told me all about the good
      place. She said all a body would have to do there was to go around
      all day long with a harp and sing, forever and ever. So I didn&rsquo;t
      think much of it. But I never said so. I asked her if she reckoned
      Tom Sawyer would go there, and she said not by a considerable sight.
      I was glad about that, because I wanted him and me to be together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Watson she kept pecking at me, and it got tiresome and lonesome.
      By and by they fetched the niggers in and had prayers, and then
      everybody was off to bed. I went up to my room with a piece of
      candle, and put it on the table. Then I set down in a chair by the
      window and tried to think of something cheerful, but it warn&rsquo;t no
      use. I felt so lonesome I most wished I was dead. The stars
      were shining, and the leaves rustled in the woods ever so mournful; and I
      heard an owl, away off, who-whooing about somebody that was dead, and a
      whippowill and a dog crying about somebody that was going to die; and the
      wind was trying to whisper something to me, and I couldn&rsquo;t make out
      what it was, and so it made the cold shivers run over me. Then away out in
      the woods I heard that kind of a sound that a ghost makes when it wants to
      tell about something that&rsquo;s on its mind and can&rsquo;t make itself
      understood, and so can&rsquo;t rest easy in its grave, and has to go about
      that way every night grieving. I got so down-hearted and scared I
      did wish I had some company. Pretty soon a spider went crawling up
      my shoulder, and I flipped it off and it lit in the candle; and before I
      could budge it was all shriveled up. I didn&rsquo;t need anybody to
      tell me that that was an awful bad sign and would fetch me some bad luck,
      so I was scared and most shook the clothes off of me. I got up and turned
      around in my tracks three times and crossed my breast every time; and then
      I tied up a little lock of my hair with a thread to keep witches away.
      But I hadn&rsquo;t no confidence. You do that when you&rsquo;ve
      lost a horseshoe that you&rsquo;ve found, instead of nailing it up over
      the door, but I hadn&rsquo;t ever heard anybody say it was any way to keep
      off bad luck when you&rsquo;d killed a spider.
    </p>
    <p>
      I set down again, a-shaking all over, and got out my pipe for a smoke; for
      the house was all as still as death now, and so the widow wouldn&rsquo;t
      know. Well, after a long time I heard the clock away off in the town go
      boom&mdash;boom&mdash;boom&mdash;twelve licks; and all still again&mdash;stiller
      than ever. Pretty soon I heard a twig snap down in the dark amongst the
      trees&mdash;something was a stirring. I set still and listened.
      Directly I could just barely hear a &ldquo;me-yow! me-yow!&rdquo;
      down there. That was good! Says I, &ldquo;me-yow! me-yow!&rdquo;
      as soft as I could, and then I put out the light and scrambled out of the
      window on to the shed. Then I slipped down to the ground and crawled
      in among the trees, and, sure enough, there was Tom Sawyer waiting for me.

      <br /> <br /> CHAPTER II.
    </p>
    <p>
      We went tiptoeing along a path amongst the trees back towards the end of
      the widow&rsquo;s garden, stooping down so as the branches wouldn&rsquo;t
      scrape our heads. When we was passing by the kitchen I fell over a root
      and made a noise. We scrouched down and laid still. Miss
      Watson&rsquo;s big nigger, named Jim, was setting in the kitchen door; we
      could see him pretty clear, because there was a light behind him. He
      got up and stretched his neck out about a minute, listening. Then he
      says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who dah?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He listened some more; then he come tiptoeing down and stood right between
      us; we could a touched him, nearly. Well, likely it was minutes and
      minutes that there warn&rsquo;t a sound, and we all there so close
      together. There was a place on my ankle that got to itching, but I
      dasn&rsquo;t scratch it; and then my ear begun to itch; and next my back,
      right between my shoulders. Seemed like I&rsquo;d die if I couldn&rsquo;t
      scratch. Well, I&rsquo;ve noticed that thing plenty times since.
      If you are with the quality, or at a funeral, or trying to go to
      sleep when you ain&rsquo;t sleepy&mdash;if you are anywheres where it won&rsquo;t
      do for you to scratch, why you will itch all over in upwards of a thousand
      places. Pretty soon Jim says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, who is you? Whar is you? Dog my cats ef I didn&rsquo; 
      hear sumf&rsquo;n. Well, I know what I&rsquo;s gwyne to do: I&rsquo;s
      gwyne to set down here and listen tell I hears it agin.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <a name="c02-24" id="c02-24"></a><br /> <br />
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:60%">
      <img alt="c02-24.jpg (38K)" src="images/c02-24.jpg" style="width:100%;" /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      So he set down on the ground betwixt me and Tom. He leaned his back
      up against a tree, and stretched his legs out till one of them most
      touched one of mine. My nose begun to itch. It itched till the
      tears come into my eyes. But I dasn&rsquo;t scratch. Then it
      begun to itch on the inside. Next I got to itching underneath. I
      didn&rsquo;t know how I was going to set still. This miserableness went on
      as much as six or seven minutes; but it seemed a sight longer than that.
      I was itching in eleven different places now. I reckoned I
      couldn&rsquo;t stand it more&rsquo;n a minute longer, but I set my teeth
      hard and got ready to try. Just then Jim begun to breathe heavy;
      next he begun to snore&mdash;and then I was pretty soon comfortable again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom he made a sign to me&mdash;kind of a little noise with his mouth&mdash;and
      we went creeping away on our hands and knees. When we was ten foot
      off Tom whispered to me, and wanted to tie Jim to the tree for fun. But
      I said no; he might wake and make a disturbance, and then they&rsquo;d
      find out I warn&rsquo;t in. Then Tom said he hadn&rsquo;t got candles
      enough, and he would slip in the kitchen and get some more. I didn&rsquo;t
      want him to try. I said Jim might wake up and come. But Tom
      wanted to resk it; so we slid in there and got three candles, and Tom laid
      five cents on the table for pay. Then we got out, and I was in a sweat to
      get away; but nothing would do Tom but he must crawl to where Jim was, on
      his hands and knees, and play something on him. I waited, and it
      seemed a good while, everything was so still and lonesome.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as Tom was back we cut along the path, around the garden fence,
      and by and by fetched up on the steep top of the hill the other side of
      the house. Tom said he slipped Jim&rsquo;s hat off of his head and
      hung it on a limb right over him, and Jim stirred a little, but he didn&rsquo;t
      wake. Afterwards Jim said the witches be witched him and put him in a
      trance, and rode him all over the State, and then set him under the trees
      again, and hung his hat on a limb to show who done it. And next time
      Jim told it he said they rode him down to New Orleans; and, after that,
      every time he told it he spread it more and more, till by and by he said
      they rode him all over the world, and tired him most to death, and his
      back was all over saddle-boils. Jim was monstrous proud about it,
      and he got so he wouldn&rsquo;t hardly notice the other niggers. Niggers
      would come miles to hear Jim tell about it, and he was more looked up to
      than any nigger in that country. Strange niggers would stand with
      their mouths open and look him all over, same as if he was a wonder.
      Niggers is always talking about witches in the dark by the kitchen
      fire; but whenever one was talking and letting on to know all about such
      things, Jim would happen in and say, &ldquo;Hm! What you know
      &rsquo;bout witches?&rdquo; and that nigger was corked up and had to take
      a back seat. Jim always kept that five-center piece round his neck
      with a string, and said it was a charm the devil give to him with his own
      hands, and told him he could cure anybody with it and fetch witches
      whenever he wanted to just by saying something to it; but he never told
      what it was he said to it. Niggers would come from all around there
      and give Jim anything they had, just for a sight of that five-center
      piece; but they wouldn&rsquo;t touch it, because the devil had had his
      hands on it. Jim was most ruined for a servant, because he got stuck
      up on account of having seen the devil and been rode by witches.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, when Tom and me got to the edge of the hilltop we looked away down
      into the village and could see three or four lights twinkling, where there
      was sick folks, maybe; and the stars over us was sparkling ever so fine;
      and down by the village was the river, a whole mile broad, and awful still
      and grand. We went down the hill and found Jo Harper and Ben Rogers,
      and two or three more of the boys, hid in the old tanyard. So we
      unhitched a skiff and pulled down the river two mile and a half, to the
      big scar on the hillside, and went ashore.
    </p>
    <p>
      We went to a clump of bushes, and Tom made everybody swear to keep the
      secret, and then showed them a hole in the hill, right in the thickest
      part of the bushes. Then we lit the candles, and crawled in on our
      hands and knees. We went about two hundred yards, and then the cave
      opened up. Tom poked about amongst the passages, and pretty soon ducked
      under a wall where you wouldn&rsquo;t a noticed that there was a hole.
      We went along a narrow place and got into a kind of room, all damp
      and sweaty and cold, and there we stopped. Tom says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, we&rsquo;ll start this band of robbers and call it Tom Sawyer&rsquo;s
      Gang. Everybody that wants to join has got to take an oath, and write his
      name in blood.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <a name="c02-25" id="c02-25"></a><br /> <br />
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:60%">
      <img alt="c02-25.jpg (68K)" src="images/c02-25.jpg" style="width:100%;" /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Everybody was willing. So Tom got out a sheet of paper that he had
      wrote the oath on, and read it. It swore every boy to stick to the
      band, and never tell any of the secrets; and if anybody done anything to
      any boy in the band, whichever boy was ordered to kill that person and his
      family must do it, and he mustn&rsquo;t eat and he mustn&rsquo;t sleep
      till he had killed them and hacked a cross in their breasts, which was the
      sign of the band. And nobody that didn&rsquo;t belong to the band could
      use that mark, and if he did he must be sued; and if he done it again he
      must be killed. And if anybody that belonged to the band told the
      secrets, he must have his throat cut, and then have his carcass burnt up
      and the ashes scattered all around, and his name blotted off of the list
      with blood and never mentioned again by the gang, but have a curse put on
      it and be forgot forever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everybody said it was a real beautiful oath, and asked Tom if he got it
      out of his own head. He said, some of it, but the rest was out of
      pirate-books and robber-books, and every gang that was high-toned had it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some thought it would be good to kill the <i>families</i> of boys that
      told the secrets. Tom said it was a good idea, so he took a pencil
      and wrote it in. Then Ben Rogers says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s Huck Finn, he hain&rsquo;t got no family; what you
      going to do &rsquo;bout him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, hain&rsquo;t he got a father?&rdquo; says Tom Sawyer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he&rsquo;s got a father, but you can&rsquo;t never find him
      these days. He used to lay drunk with the hogs in the tanyard, but
      he hain&rsquo;t been seen in these parts for a year or more.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They talked it over, and they was going to rule me out, because they said
      every boy must have a family or somebody to kill, or else it wouldn&rsquo;t
      be fair and square for the others. Well, nobody could think of
      anything to do&mdash;everybody was stumped, and set still. I was
      most ready to cry; but all at once I thought of a way, and so I offered
      them Miss Watson&mdash;they could kill her. Everybody said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, she&rsquo;ll do. That&rsquo;s all right. Huck can
      come in.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then they all stuck a pin in their fingers to get blood to sign with, and
      I made my mark on the paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; says Ben Rogers, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the line of
      business of this Gang?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing only robbery and murder,&rdquo; Tom said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But who are we going to rob?&mdash;houses, or cattle, or&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stuff! stealing cattle and such things ain&rsquo;t robbery; it&rsquo;s
      burglary,&rdquo; says Tom Sawyer. &ldquo;We ain&rsquo;t burglars. That
      ain&rsquo;t no sort of style. We are highwaymen. We stop
      stages and carriages on the road, with masks on, and kill the people and
      take their watches and money.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Must we always kill the people?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, certainly. It&rsquo;s best. Some authorities think
      different, but mostly it&rsquo;s considered best to kill them&mdash;except
      some that you bring to the cave here, and keep them till they&rsquo;re
      ransomed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ransomed? What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. But that&rsquo;s what they do. I&rsquo;ve
      seen it in books; and so of course that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ve got to
      do.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how can we do it if we don&rsquo;t know what it is?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, blame it all, we&rsquo;ve <i>got</i> to do it. Don&rsquo;t
      I tell you it&rsquo;s in the books? Do you want to go to doing
      different from what&rsquo;s in the books, and get things all muddled up?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s all very fine to <i>say</i>, Tom Sawyer, but how
      in the nation are these fellows going to be ransomed if we don&rsquo;t
      know how to do it to them?&mdash;that&rsquo;s the thing I want to get at.
      Now, what do you reckon it is?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know. But per&rsquo;aps if we keep them
      till they&rsquo;re ransomed, it means that we keep them till they&rsquo;re
      dead.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, that&rsquo;s something <i>like</i>. That&rsquo;ll
      answer. Why couldn&rsquo;t you said that before? We&rsquo;ll
      keep them till they&rsquo;re ransomed to death; and a bothersome lot they&rsquo;ll
      be, too&mdash;eating up everything, and always trying to get loose.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How you talk, Ben Rogers. How can they get loose when there&rsquo;s
      a guard over them, ready to shoot them down if they move a peg?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A guard! Well, that <i>is</i> good. So somebody&rsquo;s
      got to set up all night and never get any sleep, just so as to watch them.
      I think that&rsquo;s foolishness. Why can&rsquo;t a body take a club
      and ransom them as soon as they get here?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because it ain&rsquo;t in the books so&mdash;that&rsquo;s why.
      Now, Ben Rogers, do you want to do things regular, or don&rsquo;t
      you?&mdash;that&rsquo;s the idea. Don&rsquo;t you reckon that the
      people that made the books knows what&rsquo;s the correct thing to do?
      Do you reckon <i>you</i> can learn &rsquo;em anything? Not by
      a good deal. No, sir, we&rsquo;ll just go on and ransom them in the
      regular way.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right. I don&rsquo;t mind; but I say it&rsquo;s a fool
      way, anyhow. Say, do we kill the women, too?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Ben Rogers, if I was as ignorant as you I wouldn&rsquo;t let
      on. Kill the women? No; nobody ever saw anything in the books
      like that. You fetch them to the cave, and you&rsquo;re always as
      polite as pie to them; and by and by they fall in love with you, and never
      want to go home any more.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if that&rsquo;s the way I&rsquo;m agreed, but I don&rsquo;t
      take no stock in it. Mighty soon we&rsquo;ll have the cave so cluttered up
      with women, and fellows waiting to be ransomed, that there won&rsquo;t be
      no place for the robbers. But go ahead, I ain&rsquo;t got nothing to say.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Tommy Barnes was asleep now, and when they waked him up he was
      scared, and cried, and said he wanted to go home to his ma, and didn&rsquo;t
      want to be a robber any more.
    </p>
    <p>
      So they all made fun of him, and called him cry-baby, and that made him
      mad, and he said he would go straight and tell all the secrets. But
      Tom give him five cents to keep quiet, and said we would all go home and
      meet next week, and rob somebody and kill some people.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ben Rogers said he couldn&rsquo;t get out much, only Sundays, and so he
      wanted to begin next Sunday; but all the boys said it would be wicked to
      do it on Sunday, and that settled the thing. They agreed to get
      together and fix a day as soon as they could, and then we elected Tom
      Sawyer first captain and Jo Harper second captain of the Gang, and so
      started home.
    </p>
    <p>
      I clumb up the shed and crept into my window just before day was breaking.
      My new clothes was all greased up and clayey, and I was dog-tired.

      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> CHAPTER III.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, I got a good going-over in the morning from old Miss Watson on
      account of my clothes; but the widow she didn&rsquo;t scold, but only
      cleaned off the grease and clay, and looked so sorry that I thought I
      would behave awhile if I could. Then Miss Watson she took me in the
      closet and prayed, but nothing come of it. She told me to pray every
      day, and whatever I asked for I would get it. But it warn&rsquo;t
      so. I tried it. Once I got a fish-line, but no hooks. It warn&rsquo;t
      any good to me without hooks. I tried for the hooks three or four
      times, but somehow I couldn&rsquo;t make it work. By and by, one
      day, I asked Miss Watson to try for me, but she said I was a fool. She
      never told me why, and I couldn&rsquo;t make it out no way.
    </p>
    <p>
      I set down one time back in the woods, and had a long think about it.
      I says to myself, if a body can get anything they pray for, why don&rsquo;t
      Deacon Winn get back the money he lost on pork? Why can&rsquo;t the
      widow get back her silver snuffbox that was stole? Why can&rsquo;t
      Miss Watson fat up? No, says I to my self, there ain&rsquo;t nothing in
      it. I went and told the widow about it, and she said the thing a
      body could get by praying for it was &ldquo;spiritual gifts.&rdquo; This
      was too many for me, but she told me what she meant&mdash;I must help
      other people, and do everything I could for other people, and look out for
      them all the time, and never think about myself. This was including Miss
      Watson, as I took it. I went out in the woods and turned it over in
      my mind a long time, but I couldn&rsquo;t see no advantage about it&mdash;except
      for the other people; so at last I reckoned I wouldn&rsquo;t worry about
      it any more, but just let it go. Sometimes the widow would take me
      one side and talk about Providence in a way to make a body&rsquo;s mouth
      water; but maybe next day Miss Watson would take hold and knock it all
      down again. I judged I could see that there was two Providences, and
      a poor chap would stand considerable show with the widow&rsquo;s
      Providence, but if Miss Watson&rsquo;s got him there warn&rsquo;t no help
      for him any more. I thought it all out, and reckoned I would belong
      to the widow&rsquo;s if he wanted me, though I couldn&rsquo;t make out how
      he was a-going to be any better off then than what he was before, seeing I
      was so ignorant, and so kind of low-down and ornery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pap he hadn&rsquo;t been seen for more than a year, and that was
      comfortable for me; I didn&rsquo;t want to see him no more. He used
      to always whale me when he was sober and could get his hands on me; though
      I used to take to the woods most of the time when he was around. Well,
      about this time he was found in the river drownded, about twelve mile
      above town, so people said. They judged it was him, anyway; said
      this drownded man was just his size, and was ragged, and had uncommon long
      hair, which was all like pap; but they couldn&rsquo;t make nothing out of
      the face, because it had been in the water so long it warn&rsquo;t much
      like a face at all. They said he was floating on his back in the
      water. They took him and buried him on the bank. But I warn&rsquo;t
      comfortable long, because I happened to think of something. I knowed
      mighty well that a drownded man don&rsquo;t float on his back, but on his
      face. So I knowed, then, that this warn&rsquo;t pap, but a woman
      dressed up in a man&rsquo;s clothes. So I was uncomfortable again.
      I judged the old man would turn up again by and by, though I wished
      he wouldn&rsquo;t.
    </p>
    <p>
      We played robber now and then about a month, and then I resigned. All
      the boys did. We hadn&rsquo;t robbed nobody, hadn&rsquo;t killed any
      people, but only just pretended. We used to hop out of the woods and
      go charging down on hog-drivers and women in carts taking garden stuff to
      market, but we never hived any of them. Tom Sawyer called the hogs
      &ldquo;ingots,&rdquo; and he called the turnips and stuff &ldquo;julery,&rdquo;
      and we would go to the cave and powwow over what we had done, and how many
      people we had killed and marked. But I couldn&rsquo;t see no profit
      in it. One time Tom sent a boy to run about town with a blazing
      stick, which he called a slogan (which was the sign for the Gang to get
      together), and then he said he had got secret news by his spies that next
      day a whole parcel of Spanish merchants and rich A-rabs was going to camp
      in Cave Hollow with two hundred elephants, and six hundred camels, and
      over a thousand &ldquo;sumter&rdquo; mules, all loaded down with di&rsquo;monds,
      and they didn&rsquo;t have only a guard of four hundred soldiers, and so
      we would lay in ambuscade, as he called it, and kill the lot and scoop the
      things. He said we must slick up our swords and guns, and get ready.
      He never could go after even a turnip-cart but he must have the
      swords and guns all scoured up for it, though they was only lath and
      broomsticks, and you might scour at them till you rotted, and then they
      warn&rsquo;t worth a mouthful of ashes more than what they was before.
      I didn&rsquo;t believe we could lick such a crowd of Spaniards and
      A-rabs, but I wanted to see the camels and elephants, so I was on hand
      next day, Saturday, in the ambuscade; and when we got the word we rushed
      out of the woods and down the hill. But there warn&rsquo;t no
      Spaniards and A-rabs, and there warn&rsquo;t no camels nor no elephants.
      It warn&rsquo;t anything but a Sunday-school picnic, and only a
      primer-class at that. We busted it up, and chased the children up
      the hollow; but we never got anything but some doughnuts and jam, though
      Ben Rogers got a rag doll, and Jo Harper got a hymn-book and a tract; and
      then the teacher charged in, and made us drop everything and cut.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <a name="c03-31" id="c03-31"></a><br /> <br />
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:60%">
      <img alt="c03-31.jpg (68K)" src="images/c03-31.jpg" style="width:100%;" /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      I didn&rsquo;t see no di&rsquo;monds, and I told Tom Sawyer so.
      He said there was loads of them there, anyway; and he said there was
      A-rabs there, too, and elephants and things. I said, why couldn&rsquo;t
      we see them, then? He said if I warn&rsquo;t so ignorant, but had
      read a book called Don Quixote, I would know without asking. He said
      it was all done by enchantment. He said there was hundreds of
      soldiers there, and elephants and treasure, and so on, but we had enemies
      which he called magicians; and they had turned the whole thing into an
      infant Sunday-school, just out of spite. I said, all right; then the
      thing for us to do was to go for the magicians. Tom Sawyer said I
      was a numskull.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;a magician could call up a lot of
      genies, and they would hash you up like nothing before you could say Jack
      Robinson. They are as tall as a tree and as big around as a church.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;s&rsquo;pose we got some genies to help
      <i>us</i>&mdash;can&rsquo;t we lick the other crowd then?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How you going to get them?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. How do <i>they</i> get them?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, they rub an old tin lamp or an iron ring, and then the genies
      come tearing in, with the thunder and lightning a-ripping around and the
      smoke a-rolling, and everything they&rsquo;re told to do they up and do
      it. They don&rsquo;t think nothing of pulling a shot-tower up by the
      roots, and belting a Sunday-school superintendent over the head with it&mdash;or
      any other man.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who makes them tear around so?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, whoever rubs the lamp or the ring. They belong to
      whoever rubs the lamp or the ring, and they&rsquo;ve got to do whatever he
      says. If he tells them to build a palace forty miles long out of di&rsquo;monds,
      and fill it full of chewing-gum, or whatever you want, and fetch an
      emperor&rsquo;s daughter from China for you to marry, they&rsquo;ve got to
      do it&mdash;and they&rsquo;ve got to do it before sun-up next morning,
      too. And more: they&rsquo;ve got to waltz that palace around
      over the country wherever you want it, you understand.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;I think they are a pack of flat-heads
      for not keeping the palace themselves &rsquo;stead of fooling them away
      like that. And what&rsquo;s more&mdash;if I was one of them I would
      see a man in Jericho before I would drop my business and come to him for
      the rubbing of an old tin lamp.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How you talk, Huck Finn. Why, you&rsquo;d <i>have</i> to come
      when he rubbed it, whether you wanted to or not.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! and I as high as a tree and as big as a church? All
      right, then; I <i>would</i> come; but I lay I&rsquo;d make that man climb
      the highest tree there was in the country.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shucks, it ain&rsquo;t no use to talk to you, Huck Finn. You
      don&rsquo;t seem to know anything, somehow&mdash;perfect saphead.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I thought all this over for two or three days, and then I reckoned I would
      see if there was anything in it. I got an old tin lamp and an iron
      ring, and went out in the woods and rubbed and rubbed till I sweat like an
      Injun, calculating to build a palace and sell it; but it warn&rsquo;t no
      use, none of the genies come. So then I judged that all that stuff
      was only just one of Tom Sawyer&rsquo;s lies. I reckoned he believed
      in the A-rabs and the elephants, but as for me I think different. It
      had all the marks of a Sunday-school.

      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> CHAPTER IV.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, three or four months run along, and it was well into the winter now.
      I had been to school most all the time and could spell and read and write
      just a little, and could say the multiplication table up to six times
      seven is thirty-five, and I don&rsquo;t reckon I could ever get any
      further than that if I was to live forever. I don&rsquo;t take no
      stock in mathematics, anyway.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first I hated the school, but by and by I got so I could stand it.
      Whenever I got uncommon tired I played hookey, and the hiding I got next
      day done me good and cheered me up. So the longer I went to school
      the easier it got to be. I was getting sort of used to the widow&rsquo;s
      ways, too, and they warn&rsquo;t so raspy on me. Living in a house
      and sleeping in a bed pulled on me pretty tight mostly, but before the
      cold weather I used to slide out and sleep in the woods sometimes, and so
      that was a rest to me. I liked the old ways best, but I was getting
      so I liked the new ones, too, a little bit. The widow said I was coming
      along slow but sure, and doing very satisfactory. She said she warn&rsquo;t
      ashamed of me.
    </p>
    <p>
      One morning I happened to turn over the salt-cellar at breakfast. I
      reached for some of it as quick as I could to throw over my left shoulder
      and keep off the bad luck, but Miss Watson was in ahead of me, and crossed
      me off. She says, &ldquo;Take your hands away, Huckleberry; what a mess
      you are always making!&rdquo; The widow put in a good word for me,
      but that warn&rsquo;t going to keep off the bad luck, I knowed that well
      enough. I started out, after breakfast, feeling worried and shaky,
      and wondering where it was going to fall on me, and what it was going to
      be. There is ways to keep off some kinds of bad luck, but this wasn&rsquo;t
      one of them kind; so I never tried to do anything, but just poked along
      low-spirited and on the watch-out.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went down to the front garden and clumb over the stile where you go
      through the high board fence. There was an inch of new snow on the
      ground, and I seen somebody&rsquo;s tracks. They had come up from
      the quarry and stood around the stile a while, and then went on around the
      garden fence. It was funny they hadn&rsquo;t come in, after standing
      around so. I couldn&rsquo;t make it out. It was very curious,
      somehow. I was going to follow around, but I stooped down to look at
      the tracks first. I didn&rsquo;t notice anything at first, but next
      I did. There was a cross in the left boot-heel made with big nails,
      to keep off the devil.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was up in a second and shinning down the hill. I looked over my
      shoulder every now and then, but I didn&rsquo;t see nobody. I was at
      Judge Thatcher&rsquo;s as quick as I could get there. He said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, my boy, you are all out of breath. Did you come for your
      interest?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; I says; &ldquo;is there some for me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, a half-yearly is in last night&mdash;over a hundred and
      fifty dollars. Quite a fortune for you. You had better let me
      invest it along with your six thousand, because if you take it you&rsquo;ll
      spend it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to spend it.
      I don&rsquo;t want it at all&mdash;nor the six thousand, nuther.
      I want you to take it; I want to give it to you&mdash;the six
      thousand and all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <a name="c04-36" id="c04-36"></a><br /> <br />
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:60%">

    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked surprised. He couldn&rsquo;t seem to make it out. He
      says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, what can you mean, my boy?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I says, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you ask me no questions about it, please.
      You&rsquo;ll take it&mdash;won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m puzzled. Is something the matter?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please take it,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;and don&rsquo;t ask me
      nothing&mdash;then I won&rsquo;t have to tell no lies.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He studied a while, and then he says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oho-o! I think I see. You want to <i>sell</i> all your
      property to me&mdash;not give it. That&rsquo;s the correct idea.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he wrote something on a paper and read it over, and says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There; you see it says &lsquo;for a consideration.&rsquo; That
      means I have bought it of you and paid you for it. Here&rsquo;s a
      dollar for you. Now you sign it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So I signed it, and left.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Watson&rsquo;s nigger, Jim, had a hair-ball as big as your fist,
      which had been took out of the fourth stomach of an ox, and he used to do
      magic with it. He said there was a spirit inside of it, and it
      knowed everything. So I went to him that night and told him pap was
      here again, for I found his tracks in the snow. What I wanted to
      know was, what he was going to do, and was he going to stay? Jim got
      out his hair-ball and said something over it, and then he held it up and
      dropped it on the floor. It fell pretty solid, and only rolled about
      an inch. Jim tried it again, and then another time, and it acted
      just the same. Jim got down on his knees, and put his ear against it
      and listened. But it warn&rsquo;t no use; he said it wouldn&rsquo;t
      talk. He said sometimes it wouldn&rsquo;t talk without money. I told
      him I had an old slick counterfeit quarter that warn&rsquo;t no good
      because the brass showed through the silver a little, and it wouldn&rsquo;t
      pass nohow, even if the brass didn&rsquo;t show, because it was so slick
      it felt greasy, and so that would tell on it every time. (I reckoned
      I wouldn&rsquo;t say nothing about the dollar I got from the judge.) I
      said it was pretty bad money, but maybe the hair-ball would take it,
      because maybe it wouldn&rsquo;t know the difference. Jim smelt it
      and bit it and rubbed it, and said he would manage so the hair-ball would
      think it was good. He said he would split open a raw Irish potato
      and stick the quarter in between and keep it there all night, and next
      morning you couldn&rsquo;t see no brass, and it wouldn&rsquo;t feel greasy
      no more, and so anybody in town would take it in a minute, let alone a
      hair-ball. Well, I knowed a potato would do that before, but I had
      forgot it.
    </p>

    </div>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Jim put the quarter under the hair-ball, and got down and listened again.
      This time he said the hair-ball was all right. He said it would tell
      my whole fortune if I wanted it to. I says, go on. So the
      hair-ball talked to Jim, and Jim told it to me. He says:
    </p>

      When I lit my candle and went up to my room that night there sat pap his

      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> CHAPTER V.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had shut the door to. Then I turned around and there he was.
      I used to be scared of him all the time, he tanned me so much.
      I reckoned I was scared now, too; but in a minute I see I was
      mistaken&mdash;that is, after the first jolt, as you may say, when my
      breath sort of hitched, he being so unexpected; but right away after I see
      I warn&rsquo;t scared of him worth bothring about.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was most fifty, and he looked it. His hair was long and tangled
      and greasy, and hung down, and you could see his eyes shining through like
      he was behind vines. It was all black, no gray; so was his long,
      mixed-up whiskers. There warn&rsquo;t no color in his face, where
      his face showed; it was white; not like another man&rsquo;s white, but a
      white to make a body sick, a white to make a body&rsquo;s flesh crawl&mdash;a
      tree-toad white, a fish-belly white. As for his clothes&mdash;just
      rags, that was all. He had one ankle resting on t&rsquo;other knee;
      the boot on that foot was busted, and two of his toes stuck through, and
      he worked them now and then. His hat was laying on the floor&mdash;an
      old black slouch with the top caved in, like a lid.
    </p>
    <p>
      I stood a-looking at him; he set there a-looking at me, with his chair
      tilted back a little. I set the candle down. I noticed the
      window was up; so he had clumb in by the shed. He kept a-looking me
      all over. By and by he says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Starchy clothes&mdash;very. You think you&rsquo;re a good
      deal of a big-bug, <i>don&rsquo;t</i> you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe I am, maybe I ain&rsquo;t,&rdquo; I says.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you give me none o&rsquo; your lip,&rdquo; says he.
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve put on considerable many frills since I been away.
      I&rsquo;ll take you down a peg before I get done with you. You&rsquo;re
      educated, too, they say&mdash;can read and write. You think you&rsquo;re
      better&rsquo;n your father, now, don&rsquo;t you, because he can&rsquo;t?
      <i>I&rsquo;ll</i> take it out of you. Who told you you might
      meddle with such hifalut&rsquo;n foolishness, hey?&mdash;who told you you
      could?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The widow. She told me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The widow, hey?&mdash;and who told the widow she could put in her
      shovel about a thing that ain&rsquo;t none of her business?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody never told her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll learn her how to meddle. And looky here&mdash;you
      drop that school, you hear? I&rsquo;ll learn people to bring up a
      boy to put on airs over his own father and let on to be better&rsquo;n
      what <i>he</i> is. You lemme catch you fooling around that school
      again, you hear? Your mother couldn&rsquo;t read, and she couldn&rsquo;t
      write, nuther, before she died. None of the family couldn&rsquo;t
      before <i>they</i> died. I can&rsquo;t; and here you&rsquo;re
      a-swelling yourself up like this. I ain&rsquo;t the man to stand it&mdash;you
      hear? Say, lemme hear you read.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I took up a book and begun something about General Washington and the
      wars. When I&rsquo;d read about a half a minute, he fetched the book a
      whack with his hand and knocked it across the house. He says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so. You can do it. I had my doubts when you
      told me. Now looky here; you stop that putting on frills. I
      won&rsquo;t have it. I&rsquo;ll lay for you, my smarty; and if I
      catch you about that school I&rsquo;ll tan you good. First you know you&rsquo;ll
      get religion, too. I never see such a son.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He took up a little blue and yaller picture of some cows and a boy, and
      says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s something they give me for learning my lessons good.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He tore it up, and says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you something better&mdash;I&rsquo;ll give you a
      cowhide.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He set there a-mumbling and a-growling a minute, and then he says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Ain&rsquo;t</i> you a sweet-scented dandy, though? A bed;
      and bedclothes; and a look&rsquo;n&rsquo;-glass; and a piece of carpet on
      the floor&mdash;and your own father got to sleep with the hogs in the
      tanyard. I never see such a son. I bet I&rsquo;ll take some o&rsquo; 
      these frills out o&rsquo; you before I&rsquo;m done with you. Why, there
      ain&rsquo;t no end to your airs&mdash;they say you&rsquo;re rich. Hey?&mdash;how&rsquo;s
      that?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <a name="c05-41" id="c05-41"></a><br /> <br />
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:60%">
      <img alt="c05-41.jpg (49K)" src="images/c05-41.jpg" style="width:100%;" /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They lie&mdash;that&rsquo;s how.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Looky here&mdash;mind how you talk to me; I&rsquo;m a-standing
      about all I can stand now&mdash;so don&rsquo;t gimme no sass. I&rsquo;ve
      been in town two days, and I hain&rsquo;t heard nothing but about you bein&rsquo; 
      rich. I heard about it away down the river, too. That&rsquo;s
      why I come. You git me that money to-morrow&mdash;I want it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hain&rsquo;t got no money.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a lie. Judge Thatcher&rsquo;s got it. You
      git it. I want it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hain&rsquo;t got no money, I tell you. You ask Judge
      Thatcher; he&rsquo;ll tell you the same.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right. I&rsquo;ll ask him; and I&rsquo;ll make him
      pungle, too, or I&rsquo;ll know the reason why. Say, how much you
      got in your pocket? I want it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hain&rsquo;t got only a dollar, and I want that to&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It don&rsquo;t make no difference what you want it for&mdash;you
      just shell it out.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He took it and bit it to see if it was good, and then he said he was going
      down town to get some whisky; said he hadn&rsquo;t had a drink all day.
      When he had got out on the shed he put his head in again, and cussed me
      for putting on frills and trying to be better than him; and when I
      reckoned he was gone he come back and put his head in again, and told me
      to mind about that school, because he was going to lay for me and lick me
      if I didn&rsquo;t drop that.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next day he was drunk, and he went to Judge Thatcher&rsquo;s and
      bullyragged him, and tried to make him give up the money; but he couldn&rsquo;t,
      and then he swore he&rsquo;d make the law force him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The judge and the widow went to law to get the court to take me away from
      him and let one of them be my guardian; but it was a new judge that had
      just come, and he didn&rsquo;t know the old man; so he said courts mustn&rsquo;t
      interfere and separate families if they could help it; said he&rsquo;d
      druther not take a child away from its father. So Judge Thatcher and
      the widow had to quit on the business.
    </p>
    <p>
      That pleased the old man till he couldn&rsquo;t rest. He said he&rsquo;d
      cowhide me till I was black and blue if I didn&rsquo;t raise some money
      for him. I borrowed three dollars from Judge Thatcher, and pap took
      it and got drunk, and went a-blowing around and cussing and whooping and
      carrying on; and he kept it up all over town, with a tin pan, till most
      midnight; then they jailed him, and next day they had him before court,
      and jailed him again for a week. But he said <i>he</i> was
      satisfied; said he was boss of his son, and he&rsquo;d make it warm for <i>him</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he got out the new judge said he was a-going to make a man of him. So
      he took him to his own house, and dressed him up clean and nice, and had
      him to breakfast and dinner and supper with the family, and was just old
      pie to him, so to speak. And after supper he talked to him about
      temperance and such things till the old man cried, and said he&rsquo;d
      been a fool, and fooled away his life; but now he was a-going to turn over
      a new leaf and be a man nobody wouldn&rsquo;t be ashamed of, and he hoped
      the judge would help him and not look down on him. The judge said he
      could hug him for them words; so he cried, and his wife she cried again;
      pap said he&rsquo;d been a man that had always been misunderstood before,
      and the judge said he believed it. The old man said that what a man
      wanted that was down was sympathy, and the judge said it was so; so they
      cried again. And when it was bedtime the old man rose up and held
      out his hand, and says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look at it, gentlemen and ladies all; take a-hold of it; shake it.
      There&rsquo;s a hand that was the hand of a hog; but it ain&rsquo;t so no
      more; it&rsquo;s the hand of a man that&rsquo;s started in on a new life,
      and&rsquo;ll die before he&rsquo;ll go back. You mark them words&mdash;don&rsquo;t
      forget I said them. It&rsquo;s a clean hand now; shake it&mdash;don&rsquo;t
      be afeard.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <a name="c05-43" id="c05-43"></a><br /> <br />
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:60%">
      <img alt="c05-43.jpg (51K)" src="images/c05-43.jpg" style="width:100%;" /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      So they shook it, one after the other, all around, and cried. The
      judge&rsquo;s wife she kissed it. Then the old man he signed a
      pledge&mdash;made his mark. The judge said it was the holiest time on
      record, or something like that. Then they tucked the old man into a
      beautiful room, which was the spare room, and in the night some time he
      got powerful thirsty and clumb out on to the porch-roof and slid down a
      stanchion and traded his new coat for a jug of forty-rod, and clumb back
      again and had a good old time; and towards daylight he crawled out again,
      drunk as a fiddler, and rolled off the porch and broke his left arm in two
      places, and was most froze to death when somebody found him after sun-up.
      And when they come to look at that spare room they had to take
      soundings before they could navigate it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The judge he felt kind of sore. He said he reckoned a body could
      reform the old man with a shotgun, maybe, but he didn&rsquo;t know no
      other way.

      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> CHAPTER VI.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, pretty soon the old man was up and around again, and then he went
      for Judge Thatcher in the courts to make him give up that money, and he
      went for me, too, for not stopping school. He catched me a couple of
      times and thrashed me, but I went to school just the same, and dodged him
      or outrun him most of the time. I didn&rsquo;t want to go to school
      much before, but I reckoned I&rsquo;d go now to spite pap. That law
      trial was a slow business&mdash;appeared like they warn&rsquo;t ever going
      to get started on it; so every now and then I&rsquo;d borrow two or three
      dollars off of the judge for him, to keep from getting a cowhiding. Every
      time he got money he got drunk; and every time he got drunk he raised Cain
      around town; and every time he raised Cain he got jailed. He was
      just suited&mdash;this kind of thing was right in his line.
    </p>
    <p>
      He got to hanging around the widow&rsquo;s too much and so she told him at
      last that if he didn&rsquo;t quit using around there she would make
      trouble for him. Well, <i>wasn&rsquo;t</i> he mad? He said he would
      show who was Huck Finn&rsquo;s boss. So he watched out for me one
      day in the spring, and catched me, and took me up the river about three
      mile in a skiff, and crossed over to the Illinois shore where it was woody
      and there warn&rsquo;t no houses but an old log hut in a place where the
      timber was so thick you couldn&rsquo;t find it if you didn&rsquo;t know
      where it was.
    </p>
    <p>
      He kept me with him all the time, and I never got a chance to run off. We
      lived in that old cabin, and he always locked the door and put the key
      under his head nights. He had a gun which he had stole, I reckon,
      and we fished and hunted, and that was what we lived on. Every
      little while he locked me in and went down to the store, three miles, to
      the ferry, and traded fish and game for whisky, and fetched it home and
      got drunk and had a good time, and licked me. The widow she found
      out where I was by and by, and she sent a man over to try to get hold of
      me; but pap drove him off with the gun, and it warn&rsquo;t long after
      that till I was used to being where I was, and liked it&mdash;all but the
      cowhide part.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was kind of lazy and jolly, laying off comfortable all day, smoking and
      fishing, and no books nor study. Two months or more run along, and
      my clothes got to be all rags and dirt, and I didn&rsquo;t see how I&rsquo;d
      ever got to like it so well at the widow&rsquo;s, where you had to wash,
      and eat on a plate, and comb up, and go to bed and get up regular, and be
      forever bothering over a book, and have old Miss Watson pecking at you all
      the time. I didn&rsquo;t want to go back no more. I had
      stopped cussing, because the widow didn&rsquo;t like it; but now I took to
      it again because pap hadn&rsquo;t no objections. It was pretty good
      times up in the woods there, take it all around.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <a name="c06-46" id="c06-46"></a><br /> <br />
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:60%">
      <img alt="c06-46.jpg (60K)" src="images/c06-46.jpg" style="width:100%;" /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      But by and by pap got too handy with his hick&rsquo;ry, and I couldn&rsquo;t
      stand it. I was all over welts. He got to going away so much, too,
      and locking me in. Once he locked me in and was gone three days.
      It was dreadful lonesome. I judged he had got drownded, and I
      wasn&rsquo;t ever going to get out any more. I was scared. I
      made up my mind I would fix up some way to leave there. I had tried
      to get out of that cabin many a time, but I couldn&rsquo;t find no way.
      There warn&rsquo;t a window to it big enough for a dog to get
      through. I couldn&rsquo;t get up the chimbly; it was too narrow.
      The door was thick, solid oak slabs. Pap was pretty careful
      not to leave a knife or anything in the cabin when he was away; I reckon I
      had hunted the place over as much as a hundred times; well, I was most all
      the time at it, because it was about the only way to put in the time.
      But this time I found something at last; I found an old rusty
      wood-saw without any handle; it was laid in between a rafter and the
      clapboards of the roof. I greased it up and went to work. There was
      an old horse-blanket nailed against the logs at the far end of the cabin
      behind the table, to keep the wind from blowing through the chinks and
      putting the candle out. I got under the table and raised the
      blanket, and went to work to saw a section of the big bottom log out&mdash;big
      enough to let me through. Well, it was a good long job, but I was
      getting towards the end of it when I heard pap&rsquo;s gun in the woods.
      I got rid of the signs of my work, and dropped the blanket and hid
      my saw, and pretty soon pap come in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pap warn&rsquo;t in a good humor&mdash;so he was his natural self. He
      said he was down town, and everything was going wrong. His lawyer
      said he reckoned he would win his lawsuit and get the money if they ever
      got started on the trial; but then there was ways to put it off a long
      time, and Judge Thatcher knowed how to do it. And he said people allowed
      there&rsquo;d be another trial to get me away from him and give me to the
      widow for my guardian, and they guessed it would win this time. This
      shook me up considerable, because I didn&rsquo;t want to go back to the
      widow&rsquo;s any more and be so cramped up and sivilized, as they called
      it. Then the old man got to cussing, and cussed everything and
      everybody he could think of, and then cussed them all over again to make
      sure he hadn&rsquo;t skipped any, and after that he polished off with a
      kind of a general cuss all round, including a considerable parcel of
      people which he didn&rsquo;t know the names of, and so called them what&rsquo;s-his-name
      when he got to them, and went right along with his cussing.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said he would like to see the widow get me. He said he would
      watch out, and if they tried to come any such game on him he knowed of a
      place six or seven mile off to stow me in, where they might hunt till they
      dropped and they couldn&rsquo;t find me. That made me pretty uneasy
      again, but only for a minute; I reckoned I wouldn&rsquo;t stay on hand
      till he got that chance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man made me go to the skiff and fetch the things he had got. There
      was a fifty-pound sack of corn meal, and a side of bacon, ammunition, and
      a four-gallon jug of whisky, and an old book and two newspapers for
      wadding, besides some tow. I toted up a load, and went back and set
      down on the bow of the skiff to rest. I thought it all over, and I
      reckoned I would walk off with the gun and some lines, and take to the
      woods when I run away. I guessed I wouldn&rsquo;t stay in one place,
      but just tramp right across the country, mostly night times, and hunt and
      fish to keep alive, and so get so far away that the old man nor the widow
      couldn&rsquo;t ever find me any more. I judged I would saw out and
      leave that night if pap got drunk enough, and I reckoned he would. I
      got so full of it I didn&rsquo;t notice how long I was staying till the
      old man hollered and asked me whether I was asleep or drownded.

    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      I got the things all up to the cabin, and then it was about dark. While
      I was cooking supper the old man took a swig or two and got sort of warmed
      up, and went to ripping again. He had been drunk over in town, and
      laid in the gutter all night, and he was a sight to look at. A body
      would a thought he was Adam&mdash;he was just all mud. Whenever his
      liquor begun to work he most always went for the govment, this time he
      says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Call this a govment! why, just look at it and see what it&rsquo;s
      like. Here&rsquo;s the law a-standing ready to take a man&rsquo;s son away
      from him&mdash;a man&rsquo;s own son, which he has had all the trouble and
      all the anxiety and all the expense of raising. Yes, just as that
      man has got that son raised at last, and ready to go to work and begin to
      do suthin&rsquo; for <i>him</i> and give him a rest, the law up and goes
      for him. And they call <i>that</i> govment! That ain&rsquo;t
      all, nuther. The law backs that old Judge Thatcher up and helps him
      to keep me out o&rsquo; my property. Here&rsquo;s what the law does:
      The law takes a man worth six thousand dollars and up&rsquo;ards,
      and jams him into an old trap of a cabin like this, and lets him go round
      in clothes that ain&rsquo;t fitten for a hog. They call that govment!
      A man can&rsquo;t get his rights in a govment like this. Sometimes I&rsquo;ve
      a mighty notion to just leave the country for good and all. Yes, and I <i>told</i>
      &rsquo;em so; I told old Thatcher so to his face. Lots of &rsquo;em
      heard me, and can tell what I said. Says I, for two cents I&rsquo;d
      leave the blamed country and never come a-near it agin. Them&rsquo;s
      the very words. I says look at my hat&mdash;if you call it a hat&mdash;but
      the lid raises up and the rest of it goes down till it&rsquo;s below my
      chin, and then it ain&rsquo;t rightly a hat at all, but more like my head
      was shoved up through a jint o&rsquo; stove-pipe. Look at it, says I&mdash;such
      a hat for me to wear&mdash;one of the wealthiest men in this town if I
      could git my rights.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, this is a wonderful govment, wonderful. Why, looky
      here. There was a free nigger there from Ohio&mdash;a mulatter, most as
      white as a white man. He had the whitest shirt on you ever see, too,
      and the shiniest hat; and there ain&rsquo;t a man in that town that&rsquo;s
      got as fine clothes as what he had; and he had a gold watch and chain, and
      a silver-headed cane&mdash;the awfulest old gray-headed nabob in the
      State. And what do you think? They said he was a p&rsquo;fessor
      in a college, and could talk all kinds of languages, and knowed
      everything. And that ain&rsquo;t the wust. They said he could <i>vote</i>
      when he was at home. Well, that let me out. Thinks I, what is the
      country a-coming to? It was &rsquo;lection day, and I was just about
      to go and vote myself if I warn&rsquo;t too drunk to get there; but when
      they told me there was a State in this country where they&rsquo;d let that
      nigger vote, I drawed out. I says I&rsquo;ll never vote agin. Them&rsquo;s
      the very words I said; they all heard me; and the country may rot for all
      me&mdash;I&rsquo;ll never vote agin as long as I live. And to see
      the cool way of that nigger&mdash;why, he wouldn&rsquo;t a give me the
      road if I hadn&rsquo;t shoved him out o&rsquo; the way. I says to
      the people, why ain&rsquo;t this nigger put up at auction and sold?&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      what I want to know. And what do you reckon they said? Why, they
      said he couldn&rsquo;t be sold till he&rsquo;d been in the State six
      months, and he hadn&rsquo;t been there that long yet. There, now&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      a specimen. They call that a govment that can&rsquo;t sell a free
      nigger till he&rsquo;s been in the State six months. Here&rsquo;s a
      govment that calls itself a govment, and lets on to be a govment, and
      thinks it is a govment, and yet&rsquo;s got to set stock-still for six
      whole months before it can take a hold of a prowling, thieving, infernal,
      white-shirted free nigger, and&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Pap was agoing on so he never noticed where his old limber legs was taking
      him to, so he went head over heels over the tub of salt pork and barked
      both shins, and the rest of his speech was all the hottest kind of
      language&mdash;mostly hove at the nigger and the govment, though he give
      the tub some, too, all along, here and there. He hopped around the
      cabin considerable, first on one leg and then on the other, holding first
      one shin and then the other one, and at last he let out with his left foot
      all of a sudden and fetched the tub a rattling kick. But it warn&rsquo;t
      good judgment, because that was the boot that had a couple of his toes
      leaking out of the front end of it; so now he raised a howl that fairly
      made a body&rsquo;s hair raise, and down he went in the dirt, and rolled
      there, and held his toes; and the cussing he done then laid over anything
      he had ever done previous. He said so his own self afterwards.
      He had heard old Sowberry Hagan in his best days, and he said it
      laid over him, too; but I reckon that was sort of piling it on, maybe.
    </p>
    <p>
      After supper pap took the jug, and said he had enough whisky there for two
      drunks and one delirium tremens. That was always his word. I
      judged he would be blind drunk in about an hour, and then I would steal
      the key, or saw myself out, one or t&rsquo;other. He drank and
      drank, and tumbled down on his blankets by and by; but luck didn&rsquo;t
      run my way. He didn&rsquo;t go sound asleep, but was uneasy. He
      groaned and moaned and thrashed around this way and that for a long time.
      At last I got so sleepy I couldn&rsquo;t keep my eyes open all I
      could do, and so before I knowed what I was about I was sound asleep, and
      the candle burning.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <a name="c06-51" id="c06-51"></a><br /> <br />
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:60%">
      <img alt="c06-51.jpg (64K)" src="images/c06-51.jpg" style="width:100%;" /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      I don&rsquo;t know how long I was asleep, but all of a sudden there was an
      awful scream and I was up. There was pap looking wild, and skipping
      around every which way and yelling about snakes. He said they was
      crawling up his legs; and then he would give a jump and scream, and say
      one had bit him on the cheek&mdash;but I couldn&rsquo;t see no snakes.
      He started and run round and round the cabin, hollering &ldquo;Take
      him off! take him off! he&rsquo;s biting me on the neck!&rdquo; I
      never see a man look so wild in the eyes. Pretty soon he was all fagged
      out, and fell down panting; then he rolled over and over wonderful fast,
      kicking things every which way, and striking and grabbing at the air with
      his hands, and screaming and saying there was devils a-hold of him. He
      wore out by and by, and laid still a while, moaning. Then he laid
      stiller, and didn&rsquo;t make a sound. I could hear the owls and
      the wolves away off in the woods, and it seemed terrible still. He
      was laying over by the corner. By and by he raised up part way and
      listened, with his head to one side. He says, very low:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tramp&mdash;tramp&mdash;tramp; that&rsquo;s the dead; tramp&mdash;tramp&mdash;tramp;
      they&rsquo;re coming after me; but I won&rsquo;t go. Oh, they&rsquo;re
      here! don&rsquo;t touch me&mdash;don&rsquo;t! hands off&mdash;they&rsquo;re
      cold; let go. Oh, let a poor devil alone!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he went down on all fours and crawled off, begging them to let him
      alone, and he rolled himself up in his blanket and wallowed in under the
      old pine table, still a-begging; and then he went to crying. I could
      hear him through the blanket.
    </p>
    <p>
      By and by he rolled out and jumped up on his feet looking wild, and he see
      me and went for me. He chased me round and round the place with a
      clasp-knife, calling me the Angel of Death, and saying he would kill me,
      and then I couldn&rsquo;t come for him no more. I begged, and told
      him I was only Huck; but he laughed <i>such</i> a screechy laugh, and
      roared and cussed, and kept on chasing me up. Once when I turned
      short and dodged under his arm he made a grab and got me by the jacket
      between my shoulders, and I thought I was gone; but I slid out of the
      jacket quick as lightning, and saved myself. Pretty soon he was all tired
      out, and dropped down with his back against the door, and said he would
      rest a minute and then kill me. He put his knife under him, and said he
      would sleep and get strong, and then he would see who was who.
    </p>
    <p>
      So he dozed off pretty soon. By and by I got the old split-bottom
      chair and clumb up as easy as I could, not to make any noise, and got down
      the gun. I slipped the ramrod down it to make sure it was loaded,
      then I laid it across the turnip barrel, pointing towards pap, and set
      down behind it to wait for him to stir. And how slow and still the
      time did drag along.

      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> CHAPTER VII.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Git up! What you &rsquo;bout?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I opened my eyes and looked around, trying to make out where I was. It
      was after sun-up, and I had been sound asleep. Pap was standing over
      me looking sour and sick, too. He says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What you doin&rsquo; with this gun?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I judged he didn&rsquo;t know nothing about what he had been doing, so I
      says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Somebody tried to get in, so I was laying for him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you roust me out?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I tried to, but I couldn&rsquo;t; I couldn&rsquo;t budge you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, all right. Don&rsquo;t stand there palavering all day,
      but out with you and see if there&rsquo;s a fish on the lines for
      breakfast. I&rsquo;ll be along in a minute.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He unlocked the door, and I cleared out up the river-bank. I noticed
      some pieces of limbs and such things floating down, and a sprinkling of
      bark; so I knowed the river had begun to rise. I reckoned I would
      have great times now if I was over at the town. The June rise used
      to be always luck for me; because as soon as that rise begins here comes
      cordwood floating down, and pieces of log rafts&mdash;sometimes a dozen
      logs together; so all you have to do is to catch them and sell them to the
      wood-yards and the sawmill.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went along up the bank with one eye out for pap and t&rsquo;other one
      out for what the rise might fetch along. Well, all at once here
      comes a canoe; just a beauty, too, about thirteen or fourteen foot long,
      riding high like a duck. I shot head-first off of the bank like a
      frog, clothes and all on, and struck out for the canoe. I just
      expected there&rsquo;d be somebody laying down in it, because people often
      done that to fool folks, and when a chap had pulled a skiff out most to it
      they&rsquo;d raise up and laugh at him. But it warn&rsquo;t so this
      time. It was a drift-canoe sure enough, and I clumb in and paddled
      her ashore. Thinks I, the old man will be glad when he sees this&mdash;she&rsquo;s
      worth ten dollars. But when I got to shore pap wasn&rsquo;t in sight
      yet, and as I was running her into a little creek like a gully, all hung
      over with vines and willows, I struck another idea: I judged I&rsquo;d
      hide her good, and then, &rsquo;stead of taking to the woods when I run
      off, I&rsquo;d go down the river about fifty mile and camp in one place
      for good, and not have such a rough time tramping on foot.
    </p>

    </div>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      It was pretty close to the shanty, and I thought I heard the old man
      coming all the time; but I got her hid; and then I out and looked around a
      bunch of willows, and there was the old man down the path a piece just
      drawing a bead on a bird with his gun. So he hadn&rsquo;t seen
      anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he got along I was hard at it taking up a &ldquo;trot&rdquo; line.
      He abused me a little for being so slow; but I told him I fell in
      the river, and that was what made me so long. I knowed he would see
      I was wet, and then he would be asking questions. We got five
      catfish off the lines and went home.
    </p>
    <p>
      While we laid off after breakfast to sleep up, both of us being about wore
      out, I got to thinking that if I could fix up some way to keep pap and the
      widow from trying to follow me, it would be a certainer thing than
      trusting to luck to get far enough off before they missed me; you see, all
      kinds of things might happen. Well, I didn&rsquo;t see no way for a
      while, but by and by pap raised up a minute to drink another barrel of
      water, and he says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another time a man comes a-prowling round here you roust me out,
      you hear? That man warn&rsquo;t here for no good. I&rsquo;d a shot
      him. Next time you roust me out, you hear?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he dropped down and went to sleep again; but what he had been saying
      give me the very idea I wanted. I says to myself, I can fix it now
      so nobody won&rsquo;t think of following me.
    </p>
    <p>
      About twelve o&rsquo;clock we turned out and went along up the bank.
      The river was coming up pretty fast, and lots of driftwood going by
      on the rise. By and by along comes part of a log raft&mdash;nine logs fast
      together. We went out with the skiff and towed it ashore. Then
      we had dinner. Anybody but pap would a waited and seen the day through, so
      as to catch more stuff; but that warn&rsquo;t pap&rsquo;s style. Nine
      logs was enough for one time; he must shove right over to town and sell.
      So he locked me in and took the skiff, and started off towing the
      raft about half-past three. I judged he wouldn&rsquo;t come back
      that night. I waited till I reckoned he had got a good start; then I
      out with my saw, and went to work on that log again. Before he was t&rsquo;other
      side of the river I was out of the hole; him and his raft was just a speck
      on the water away off yonder.
    </p>
    <p>
      I took the sack of corn meal and took it to where the canoe was hid, and
      shoved the vines and branches apart and put it in; then I done the same
      with the side of bacon; then the whisky-jug. I took all the coffee
      and sugar there was, and all the ammunition; I took the wadding; I took
      the bucket and gourd; I took a dipper and a tin cup, and my old saw and
      two blankets, and the skillet and the coffee-pot. I took fish-lines
      and matches and other things&mdash;everything that was worth a cent.
      I cleaned out the place. I wanted an axe, but there wasn&rsquo;t
      any, only the one out at the woodpile, and I knowed why I was going to
      leave that. I fetched out the gun, and now I was done.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had wore the ground a good deal crawling out of the hole and dragging
      out so many things. So I fixed that as good as I could from the
      outside by scattering dust on the place, which covered up the smoothness
      and the sawdust. Then I fixed the piece of log back into its place,
      and put two rocks under it and one against it to hold it there, for it was
      bent up at that place and didn&rsquo;t quite touch ground. If you
      stood four or five foot away and didn&rsquo;t know it was sawed, you
      wouldn&rsquo;t never notice it; and besides, this was the back of the
      cabin, and it warn&rsquo;t likely anybody would go fooling around there.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was all grass clear to the canoe, so I hadn&rsquo;t left a track.
      I followed around to see. I stood on the bank and looked out
      over the river. All safe. So I took the gun and went up a
      piece into the woods, and was hunting around for some birds when I see a
      wild pig; hogs soon went wild in them bottoms after they had got away from
      the prairie farms. I shot this fellow and took him into camp.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <a name="c07-56" id="c07-56"></a><br /> <br />
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:60%">
      <img alt="c07-56.jpg (62K)" src="images/c07-56.jpg" style="width:100%;" /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      I took the axe and smashed in the door. I beat it and hacked it
      considerable a-doing it. I fetched the pig in, and took him back
      nearly to the table and hacked into his throat with the axe, and laid him
      down on the ground to bleed; I say ground because it was ground&mdash;hard
      packed, and no boards. Well, next I took an old sack and put a lot
      of big rocks in it&mdash;all I could drag&mdash;and I started it from the
      pig, and dragged it to the door and through the woods down to the river
      and dumped it in, and down it sunk, out of sight. You could easy see
      that something had been dragged over the ground. I did wish Tom
      Sawyer was there; I knowed he would take an interest in this kind of
      business, and throw in the fancy touches. Nobody could spread
      himself like Tom Sawyer in such a thing as that.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, last I pulled out some of my hair, and blooded the axe good, and
      stuck it on the back side, and slung the axe in the corner. Then I
      took up the pig and held him to my breast with my jacket (so he couldn&rsquo;t
      drip) till I got a good piece below the house and then dumped him into the
      river. Now I thought of something else. So I went and got the
      bag of meal and my old saw out of the canoe, and fetched them to the
      house. I took the bag to where it used to stand, and ripped a hole
      in the bottom of it with the saw, for there warn&rsquo;t no knives and
      forks on the place&mdash;pap done everything with his clasp-knife about
      the cooking. Then I carried the sack about a hundred yards across
      the grass and through the willows east of the house, to a shallow lake
      that was five mile wide and full of rushes&mdash;and ducks too, you might
      say, in the season. There was a slough or a creek leading out of it
      on the other side that went miles away, I don&rsquo;t know where, but it
      didn&rsquo;t go to the river. The meal sifted out and made a little
      track all the way to the lake. I dropped pap&rsquo;s whetstone there
      too, so as to look like it had been done by accident. Then I tied up the
      rip in the meal sack with a string, so it wouldn&rsquo;t leak no more, and
      took it and my saw to the canoe again.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was about dark now; so I dropped the canoe down the river under some
      willows that hung over the bank, and waited for the moon to rise. I
      made fast to a willow; then I took a bite to eat, and by and by laid down
      in the canoe to smoke a pipe and lay out a plan. I says to myself,
      they&rsquo;ll follow the track of that sackful of rocks to the shore and
      then drag the river for me. And they&rsquo;ll follow that meal track
      to the lake and go browsing down the creek that leads out of it to find
      the robbers that killed me and took the things. They won&rsquo;t
      ever hunt the river for anything but my dead carcass. They&rsquo;ll soon
      get tired of that, and won&rsquo;t bother no more about me. All
      right; I can stop anywhere I want to. Jackson&rsquo;s Island is good
      enough for me; I know that island pretty well, and nobody ever comes
      there. And then I can paddle over to town nights, and slink around
      and pick up things I want. Jackson&rsquo;s Island&rsquo;s the place.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was pretty tired, and the first thing I knowed I was asleep. When
      I woke up I didn&rsquo;t know where I was for a minute. I set up and
      looked around, a little scared. Then I remembered. The river
      looked miles and miles across. The moon was so bright I could a
      counted the drift logs that went a-slipping along, black and still,
      hundreds of yards out from shore. Everything was dead quiet, and it looked
      late, and <i>smelt</i> late. You know what I mean&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know
      the words to put it in.
    </p>
    <p>
      I took a good gap and a stretch, and was just going to unhitch and start
      when I heard a sound away over the water. I listened. Pretty
      soon I made it out. It was that dull kind of a regular sound that
      comes from oars working in rowlocks when it&rsquo;s a still night. I
      peeped out through the willow branches, and there it was&mdash;a skiff,
      away across the water. I couldn&rsquo;t tell how many was in it.
      It kept a-coming, and when it was abreast of me I see there warn&rsquo;t
      but one man in it. Think&rsquo;s I, maybe it&rsquo;s pap, though I
      warn&rsquo;t expecting him. He dropped below me with the current,
      and by and by he came a-swinging up shore in the easy water, and he went
      by so close I could a reached out the gun and touched him. Well, it
      <i>was</i> pap, sure enough&mdash;and sober, too, by the way he laid his
      oars.
    </p>
    <p>
      I didn&rsquo;t lose no time. The next minute I was a-spinning down
      stream soft but quick in the shade of the bank. I made two mile and
      a half, and then struck out a quarter of a mile or more towards the middle
      of the river, because pretty soon I would be passing the ferry landing,
      and people might see me and hail me. I got out amongst the
      driftwood, and then laid down in the bottom of the canoe and let her
      float.
    </p>

    </div>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      I laid there, and had a good rest and a smoke out of my pipe,
      looking away into the sky; not a cloud in it. The sky looks ever so
      deep when you lay down on your back in the moonshine; I never knowed it
      before. And how far a body can hear on the water such nights! I
      heard people talking at the ferry landing. I heard what they said, too&mdash;every
      word of it. One man said it was getting towards the long days and
      the short nights now. T&rsquo;other one said <i>this</i> warn&rsquo;t
      one of the short ones, he reckoned&mdash;and then they laughed, and he
      said it over again, and they laughed again; then they waked up another
      fellow and told him, and laughed, but he didn&rsquo;t laugh; he ripped out
      something brisk, and said let him alone. The first fellow said he
      &rsquo;lowed to tell it to his old woman&mdash;she would think it was
      pretty good; but he said that warn&rsquo;t nothing to some things he had
      said in his time. I heard one man say it was nearly three o&rsquo;clock,
      and he hoped daylight wouldn&rsquo;t wait more than about a week longer.
      After that the talk got further and further away, and I couldn&rsquo;t
      make out the words any more; but I could hear the mumble, and now and then
      a laugh, too, but it seemed a long ways off.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was away below the ferry now. I rose up, and there was Jackson&rsquo;s
      Island, about two mile and a half down stream, heavy timbered and standing
      up out of the middle of the river, big and dark and solid, like a
      steamboat without any lights. There warn&rsquo;t any signs of the
      bar at the head&mdash;it was all under water now.
    </p>
    <p>
      It didn&rsquo;t take me long to get there. I shot past the head at a
      ripping rate, the current was so swift, and then I got into the dead water
      and landed on the side towards the Illinois shore. I run the canoe
      into a deep dent in the bank that I knowed about; I had to part the willow
      branches to get in; and when I made fast nobody could a seen the canoe
      from the outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went up and set down on a log at the head of the island, and looked out
      on the big river and the black driftwood and away over to the town, three
      mile away, where there was three or four lights twinkling. A
      monstrous big lumber-raft was about a mile up stream, coming along down,
      with a lantern in the middle of it. I watched it come creeping down,
      and when it was most abreast of where I stood I heard a man say, &ldquo;Stern
      oars, there! heave her head to stabboard!&rdquo; I heard that just
      as plain as if the man was by my side.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a little gray in the sky now; so I stepped into the woods, and
      laid down for a nap before breakfast.

      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> CHAPTER VIII.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun was up so high when I waked that I judged it was after eight o&rsquo;clock.
      I laid there in the grass and the cool shade thinking about things,
      and feeling rested and ruther comfortable and satisfied. I could see
      the sun out at one or two holes, but mostly it was big trees all about,
      and gloomy in there amongst them. There was freckled places on the
      ground where the light sifted down through the leaves, and the freckled
      places swapped about a little, showing there was a little breeze up there.
      A couple of squirrels set on a limb and jabbered at me very
      friendly.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was powerful lazy and comfortable&mdash;didn&rsquo;t want to get up and
      cook breakfast. Well, I was dozing off again when I thinks I hears a
      deep sound of &ldquo;boom!&rdquo; away up the river. I rouses up,
      and rests on my elbow and listens; pretty soon I hears it again. I
      hopped up, and went and looked out at a hole in the leaves, and I see a
      bunch of smoke laying on the water a long ways up&mdash;about abreast the
      ferry. And there was the ferryboat full of people floating along
      down. I knowed what was the matter now. &ldquo;Boom!&rdquo; I see
      the white smoke squirt out of the ferryboat&rsquo;s side. You see,
      they was firing cannon over the water, trying to make my carcass come to
      the top.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was pretty hungry, but it warn&rsquo;t going to do for me to start a
      fire, because they might see the smoke. So I set there and watched
      the cannon-smoke and listened to the boom. The river was a mile wide
      there, and it always looks pretty on a summer morning&mdash;so I was
      having a good enough time seeing them hunt for my remainders if I only had
      a bite to eat. Well, then I happened to think how they always put
      quicksilver in loaves of bread and float them off, because they always go
      right to the drownded carcass and stop there. So, says I, I&rsquo;ll
      keep a lookout, and if any of them&rsquo;s floating around after me I&rsquo;ll
      give them a show. I changed to the Illinois edge of the island to
      see what luck I could have, and I warn&rsquo;t disappointed. A big
      double loaf come along, and I most got it with a long stick, but my foot
      slipped and she floated out further. Of course I was where the
      current set in the closest to the shore&mdash;I knowed enough for that.
      But by and by along comes another one, and this time I won. I
      took out the plug and shook out the little dab of quicksilver, and set my
      teeth in. It was &ldquo;baker&rsquo;s bread&rdquo;&mdash;what the
      quality eat; none of your low-down corn-pone.
    </p>
    <p>
      I got a good place amongst the leaves, and set there on a log, munching
      the bread and watching the ferry-boat, and very well satisfied. And
      then something struck me. I says, now I reckon the widow or the
      parson or somebody prayed that this bread would find me, and here it has
      gone and done it. So there ain&rsquo;t no doubt but there is
      something in that thing&mdash;that is, there&rsquo;s something in it when
      a body like the widow or the parson prays, but it don&rsquo;t work for me,
      and I reckon it don&rsquo;t work for only just the right kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <a name="c08-63" id="c08-63"></a><br /> <br />
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:60%">
      <img alt="c08-63.jpg (79K)" src="images/c08-63.jpg" style="width:100%;" /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      I lit a pipe and had a good long smoke, and went on watching. The
      ferryboat was floating with the current, and I allowed I&rsquo;d have a
      chance to see who was aboard when she come along, because she would come
      in close, where the bread did. When she&rsquo;d got pretty well
      along down towards me, I put out my pipe and went to where I fished out
      the bread, and laid down behind a log on the bank in a little open place.
      Where the log forked I could peep through.
    </p>
    <p>
      By and by she come along, and she drifted in so close that they could a
      run out a plank and walked ashore. Most everybody was on the boat.
      Pap, and Judge Thatcher, and Bessie Thatcher, and Jo Harper, and Tom
      Sawyer, and his old Aunt Polly, and Sid and Mary, and plenty more. Everybody
      was talking about the murder, but the captain broke in and says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look sharp, now; the current sets in the closest here, and maybe he&rsquo;s
      washed ashore and got tangled amongst the brush at the water&rsquo;s edge.
      I hope so, anyway.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I didn&rsquo;t hope so. They all crowded up and leaned over the
      rails, nearly in my face, and kept still, watching with all their might.
      I could see them first-rate, but they couldn&rsquo;t see me. Then
      the captain sung out:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stand away!&rdquo; and the cannon let off such a blast right before
      me that it made me deef with the noise and pretty near blind with the
      smoke, and I judged I was gone. If they&rsquo;d a had some bullets
      in, I reckon they&rsquo;d a got the corpse they was after. Well, I
      see I warn&rsquo;t hurt, thanks to goodness. The boat floated on and went
      out of sight around the shoulder of the island. I could hear the
      booming now and then, further and further off, and by and by, after an
      hour, I didn&rsquo;t hear it no more. The island was three mile
      long. I judged they had got to the foot, and was giving it up.
      But they didn&rsquo;t yet a while. They turned around the foot
      of the island and started up the channel on the Missouri side, under
      steam, and booming once in a while as they went. I crossed over to
      that side and watched them. When they got abreast the head of the island
      they quit shooting and dropped over to the Missouri shore and went home to
      the town.
    </p>
    <p>
      I knowed I was all right now. Nobody else would come a-hunting after
      me. I got my traps out of the canoe and made me a nice camp in the thick
      woods. I made a kind of a tent out of my blankets to put my things
      under so the rain couldn&rsquo;t get at them. I catched a catfish
      and haggled him open with my saw, and towards sundown I started my camp
      fire and had supper. Then I set out a line to catch some fish for
      breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      When it was dark I set by my camp fire smoking, and feeling pretty well
      satisfied; but by and by it got sort of lonesome, and so I went and set on
      the bank and listened to the current swashing along, and counted the stars
      and drift logs and rafts that come down, and then went to bed; there ain&rsquo;t
      no better way to put in time when you are lonesome; you can&rsquo;t stay
      so, you soon get over it.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so for three days and nights. No difference&mdash;just the same
      thing. But the next day I went exploring around down through the island.
      I was boss of it; it all belonged to me, so to say, and I wanted to
      know all about it; but mainly I wanted to put in the time. I found
      plenty strawberries, ripe and prime; and green summer grapes, and green
      razberries; and the green blackberries was just beginning to show. They
      would all come handy by and by, I judged.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, I went fooling along in the deep woods till I judged I warn&rsquo;t
      far from the foot of the island. I had my gun along, but I hadn&rsquo;t
      shot nothing; it was for protection; thought I would kill some game nigh
      home. About this time I mighty near stepped on a good-sized snake, and it
      went sliding off through the grass and flowers, and I after it, trying to
      get a shot at it. I clipped along, and all of a sudden I bounded right on
      to the ashes of a camp fire that was still smoking.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <a name="c08-64" id="c08-64"></a><br /> <br />
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:60%">
      <img alt="c08-64.jpg (65K)" src="images/c08-64.jpg" style="width:100%;" /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      My heart jumped up amongst my lungs. I never waited for to look
      further, but uncocked my gun and went sneaking back on my tiptoes as fast
      as ever I could. Every now and then I stopped a second amongst the
      thick leaves and listened, but my breath come so hard I couldn&rsquo;t
      hear nothing else. I slunk along another piece further, then
      listened again; and so on, and so on. If I see a stump, I took it
      for a man; if I trod on a stick and broke it, it made me feel like a
      person had cut one of my breaths in two and I only got half, and the short
      half, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I got to camp I warn&rsquo;t feeling very brash, there warn&rsquo;t
      much sand in my craw; but I says, this ain&rsquo;t no time to be fooling
      around. So I got all my traps into my canoe again so as to have them
      out of sight, and I put out the fire and scattered the ashes around to
      look like an old last year&rsquo;s camp, and then clumb a tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      I reckon I was up in the tree two hours; but I didn&rsquo;t see nothing, I
      didn&rsquo;t hear nothing&mdash;I only <i>thought</i> I heard and seen as
      much as a thousand things. Well, I couldn&rsquo;t stay up there
      forever; so at last I got down, but I kept in the thick woods and on the
      lookout all the time. All I could get to eat was berries and what was left
      over from breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the time it was night I was pretty hungry. So when it was good
      and dark I slid out from shore before moonrise and paddled over to the
      Illinois bank&mdash;about a quarter of a mile. I went out in the
      woods and cooked a supper, and I had about made up my mind I would stay
      there all night when I hear a <i>plunkety-plunk, plunkety-plunk</i>, and
      says to myself, horses coming; and next I hear people&rsquo;s voices.
      I got everything into the canoe as quick as I could, and then went
      creeping through the woods to see what I could find out. I hadn&rsquo;t
      got far when I hear a man say:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We better camp here if we can find a good place; the horses is
      about beat out. Let&rsquo;s look around.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I didn&rsquo;t wait, but shoved out and paddled away easy. I tied up
      in the old place, and reckoned I would sleep in the canoe.
    </p>
    <p>
      I didn&rsquo;t sleep much. I couldn&rsquo;t, somehow, for thinking.
      And every time I waked up I thought somebody had me by the neck.
      So the sleep didn&rsquo;t do me no good. By and by I says to
      myself, I can&rsquo;t live this way; I&rsquo;m a-going to find out who it
      is that&rsquo;s here on the island with me; I&rsquo;ll find it out or
      bust. Well, I felt better right off.
    </p>
    <p>
      So I took my paddle and slid out from shore just a step or two, and then
      let the canoe drop along down amongst the shadows. The moon was
      shining, and outside of the shadows it made it most as light as day.
      I poked along well on to an hour, everything still as rocks and
      sound asleep. Well, by this time I was most down to the foot of the
      island. A little ripply, cool breeze begun to blow, and that was as
      good as saying the night was about done. I give her a turn with the
      paddle and brung her nose to shore; then I got my gun and slipped out and
      into the edge of the woods. I sat down there on a log, and looked
      out through the leaves. I see the moon go off watch, and the
      darkness begin to blanket the river. But in a little while I see a pale
      streak over the treetops, and knowed the day was coming. So I took
      my gun and slipped off towards where I had run across that camp fire,
      stopping every minute or two to listen. But I hadn&rsquo;t no luck
      somehow; I couldn&rsquo;t seem to find the place. But by and by,
      sure enough, I catched a glimpse of fire away through the trees. I
      went for it, cautious and slow. By and by I was close enough to have
      a look, and there laid a man on the ground. It most give me the
      fan-tods. He had a blanket around his head, and his head was nearly in the
      fire. I set there behind a clump of bushes, in about six foot of
      him, and kept my eyes on him steady. It was getting gray daylight
      now. Pretty soon he gapped and stretched himself and hove off the
      blanket, and it was Miss Watson&rsquo;s Jim! I bet I was glad to see
      him. I says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, Jim!&rdquo; and skipped out.
    </p>
    <p>
      He bounced up and stared at me wild. Then he drops down on his
      knees, and puts his hands together and says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doan&rsquo; hurt me&mdash;don&rsquo;t! I hain&rsquo;t ever
      done no harm to a ghos&rsquo;. I alwuz liked dead people, en done
      all I could for &rsquo;em. You go en git in de river agin, whah you
      b&rsquo;longs, en doan&rsquo; do nuffn to Ole Jim, &rsquo;at &rsquo;uz
      awluz yo&rsquo; fren&rsquo;.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <a name="c08-67" id="c08-67"></a><br /> <br />
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:60%">

    </div>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, I warn&rsquo;t long making him understand I warn&rsquo;t dead.
      I was ever so glad to see Jim. I warn&rsquo;t lonesome now.
      I told him I warn&rsquo;t afraid of <i>him</i> telling the people
      where I was. I talked along, but he only set there and looked at me;
      never said nothing. Then I says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s good daylight. Le&rsquo;s get breakfast. Make
      up your camp fire good.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s de use er makin&rsquo; up de camp fire to cook
      strawbries en sich truck? But you got a gun, hain&rsquo;t you? Den
      we kin git sumfn better den strawbries.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Strawberries and such truck,&rdquo; I says. &ldquo;Is that what you
      live on?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo; git nuffn else,&rdquo; he says.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, how long you been on the island, Jim?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I come heah de night arter you&rsquo;s killed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, all that time?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;indeedy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And ain&rsquo;t you had nothing but that kind of rubbage to eat?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sah&mdash;nuffn else.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you must be most starved, ain&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reck&rsquo;n I could eat a hoss. I think I could. How long
      you ben on de islan&rsquo;?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since the night I got killed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! W&rsquo;y, what has you lived on? But you got a
      gun. Oh, yes, you got a gun. Dat&rsquo;s good. Now you
      kill sumfn en I&rsquo;ll make up de fire.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So we went over to where the canoe was, and while he built a fire in a
      grassy open place amongst the trees, I fetched meal and bacon and coffee,
      and coffee-pot and frying-pan, and sugar and tin cups, and the nigger was
      set back considerable, because he reckoned it was all done with
      witchcraft. I catched a good big catfish, too, and Jim cleaned him with
      his knife, and fried him.
    </p>
    <p>
      When breakfast was ready we lolled on the grass and eat it smoking hot.
      Jim laid it in with all his might, for he was most about starved. Then
      when we had got pretty well stuffed, we laid off and lazied. By and
      by Jim says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But looky here, Huck, who wuz it dat &rsquo;uz killed in dat shanty
      ef it warn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I told him the whole thing, and he said it was smart. He said
      Tom Sawyer couldn&rsquo;t get up no better plan than what I had. Then
      I says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you come to be here, Jim, and how&rsquo;d you get here?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked pretty uneasy, and didn&rsquo;t say nothing for a minute. Then
      he says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe I better not tell.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Jim?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, dey&rsquo;s reasons. But you wouldn&rsquo; tell on me
      ef I uz to tell you, would you, Huck?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blamed if I would, Jim.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I b&rsquo;lieve you, Huck. I&mdash;<i>I run off</i>.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jim!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But mind, you said you wouldn&rsquo; tell&mdash;you know you said
      you wouldn&rsquo; tell, Huck.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I did. I said I wouldn&rsquo;t, and I&rsquo;ll stick to
      it. Honest <i>injun</i>, I will. People would call me a
      low-down Abolitionist and despise me for keeping mum&mdash;but that don&rsquo;t
      make no difference. I ain&rsquo;t a-going to tell, and I ain&rsquo;t
      a-going back there, anyways. So, now, le&rsquo;s know all about it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you see, it &rsquo;uz dis way. Ole missus&mdash;dat&rsquo;s
      Miss Watson&mdash;she pecks on me all de time, en treats me pooty rough,
      but she awluz said she wouldn&rsquo; sell me down to Orleans. But I
      noticed dey wuz a nigger trader roun&rsquo; de place considable lately, en
      I begin to git oneasy. Well, one night I creeps to de do&rsquo; 
      pooty late, en de do&rsquo; warn&rsquo;t quite shet, en I hear old missus
      tell de widder she gwyne to sell me down to Orleans, but she didn&rsquo; 
      want to, but she could git eight hund&rsquo;d dollars for me, en it
      &rsquo;uz sich a big stack o&rsquo; money she couldn&rsquo; resis&rsquo;.
      De widder she try to git her to say she wouldn&rsquo; do it, but I
      never waited to hear de res&rsquo;. I lit out mighty quick, I tell
      you.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tuck out en shin down de hill, en &rsquo;spec to steal a skift
      &rsquo;long de sho&rsquo; som&rsquo;ers &rsquo;bove de town, but dey wuz
      people a-stirring yit, so I hid in de ole tumble-down cooper-shop on de
      bank to wait for everybody to go &rsquo;way. Well, I wuz dah all night.
      Dey wuz somebody roun&rsquo; all de time. &rsquo;Long &rsquo;bout
      six in de mawnin&rsquo; skifts begin to go by, en &rsquo;bout eight er
      nine every skift dat went &rsquo;long wuz talkin&rsquo; &rsquo;bout how yo&rsquo; 
      pap come over to de town en say you&rsquo;s killed. Dese las&rsquo; 
      skifts wuz full o&rsquo; ladies en genlmen a-goin&rsquo; over for to see
      de place. Sometimes dey&rsquo;d pull up at de sho&rsquo; en take a
      res&rsquo; b&rsquo;fo&rsquo; dey started acrost, so by de talk I got to
      know all &rsquo;bout de killin&rsquo;. I &rsquo;uz powerful sorry
      you&rsquo;s killed, Huck, but I ain&rsquo;t no mo&rsquo; now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I laid dah under de shavin&rsquo;s all day. I &rsquo;uz
      hungry, but I warn&rsquo;t afeard; bekase I knowed ole missus en de widder
      wuz goin&rsquo; to start to de camp-meet&rsquo;n&rsquo; right arter
      breakfas&rsquo; en be gone all day, en dey knows I goes off wid de cattle
      &rsquo;bout daylight, so dey wouldn&rsquo; &rsquo;spec to see me roun&rsquo; 
      de place, en so dey wouldn&rsquo; miss me tell arter dark in de evenin&rsquo;.
      De yuther servants wouldn&rsquo; miss me, kase dey&rsquo;d shin out en
      take holiday soon as de ole folks &rsquo;uz out&rsquo;n de way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, when it come dark I tuck out up de river road, en went
      &rsquo;bout two mile er more to whah dey warn&rsquo;t no houses. I&rsquo;d
      made up my mine &rsquo;bout what I&rsquo;s agwyne to do. You see, ef
      I kep&rsquo; on tryin&rsquo; to git away afoot, de dogs &rsquo;ud track
      me; ef I stole a skift to cross over, dey&rsquo;d miss dat skift, you see,
      en dey&rsquo;d know &rsquo;bout whah I&rsquo;d lan&rsquo; on de yuther
      side, en whah to pick up my track. So I says, a raff is what I&rsquo;s
      arter; it doan&rsquo; <i>make</i> no track.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see a light a-comin&rsquo; roun&rsquo; de p&rsquo;int bymeby, so
      I wade&rsquo; in en shove&rsquo; a log ahead o&rsquo; me en swum more&rsquo;n
      half way acrost de river, en got in &rsquo;mongst de drift-wood, en kep&rsquo; 
      my head down low, en kinder swum agin de current tell de raff come along.
      Den I swum to de stern uv it en tuck a-holt. It clouded up en
      &rsquo;uz pooty dark for a little while. So I clumb up en laid down
      on de planks. De men &rsquo;uz all &rsquo;way yonder in de middle,
      whah de lantern wuz. De river wuz a-risin&rsquo;, en dey wuz a good
      current; so I reck&rsquo;n&rsquo;d &rsquo;at by fo&rsquo; in de mawnin&rsquo; 
      I&rsquo;d be twenty-five mile down de river, en den I&rsquo;d slip in jis
      b&rsquo;fo&rsquo; daylight en swim asho&rsquo;, en take to de woods on de
      Illinois side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I didn&rsquo; have no luck. When we &rsquo;uz mos&rsquo; 
      down to de head er de islan&rsquo; a man begin to come aft wid de lantern,
      I see it warn&rsquo;t no use fer to wait, so I slid overboard en struck
      out fer de islan&rsquo;. Well, I had a notion I could lan&rsquo; mos&rsquo; 
      anywhers, but I couldn&rsquo;t&mdash;bank too bluff. I &rsquo;uz mos&rsquo; 
      to de foot er de islan&rsquo; b&rsquo;fo&rsquo; I found&rsquo; a good
      place. I went into de woods en jedged I wouldn&rsquo; fool wid raffs
      no mo&rsquo;, long as dey move de lantern roun&rsquo; so. I had my
      pipe en a plug er dog-leg, en some matches in my cap, en dey warn&rsquo;t
      wet, so I &rsquo;uz all right.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so you ain&rsquo;t had no meat nor bread to eat all this time?
      Why didn&rsquo;t you get mud-turkles?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How you gwyne to git &rsquo;m? You can&rsquo;t slip up on um
      en grab um; en how&rsquo;s a body gwyne to hit um wid a rock? How
      could a body do it in de night? En I warn&rsquo;t gwyne to show
      mysef on de bank in de daytime.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s so. You&rsquo;ve had to keep in the woods
      all the time, of course. Did you hear &rsquo;em shooting the cannon?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes. I knowed dey was arter you. I see um go by
      heah&mdash;watched um thoo de bushes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Some young birds come along, flying a yard or two at a time and lighting.
      Jim said it was a sign it was going to rain. He said it was a sign
      when young chickens flew that way, and so he reckoned it was the same way
      when young birds done it. I was going to catch some of them, but Jim
      wouldn&rsquo;t let me. He said it was death. He said his
      father laid mighty sick once, and some of them catched a bird, and his old
      granny said his father would die, and he did.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Jim said you mustn&rsquo;t count the things you are going to cook for
      dinner, because that would bring bad luck. The same if you shook the
      table-cloth after sundown. And he said if a man owned a beehive and
      that man died, the bees must be told about it before sun-up next morning,
      or else the bees would all weaken down and quit work and die. Jim
      said bees wouldn&rsquo;t sting idiots; but I didn&rsquo;t believe that,
      because I had tried them lots of times myself, and they wouldn&rsquo;t
      sting me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had heard about some of these things before, but not all of them. Jim
      knowed all kinds of signs. He said he knowed most everything. I
      said it looked to me like all the signs was about bad luck, and so I asked
      him if there warn&rsquo;t any good-luck signs. He says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mighty few&mdash;an&rsquo; <i>dey</i> ain&rsquo;t no use to a body.
      What you want to know when good luck&rsquo;s a-comin&rsquo; for?
      Want to keep it off?&rdquo; And he said: &ldquo;Ef you&rsquo;s
      got hairy arms en a hairy breas&rsquo;, it&rsquo;s a sign dat you&rsquo;s
      agwyne to be rich. Well, dey&rsquo;s some use in a sign like dat, &rsquo;kase
      it&rsquo;s so fur ahead. You see, maybe you&rsquo;s got to be po&rsquo; a
      long time fust, en so you might git discourage&rsquo; en kill yo&rsquo;sef
      &rsquo;f you didn&rsquo; know by de sign dat you gwyne to be rich bymeby.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you got hairy arms and a hairy breast, Jim?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s de use to ax dat question? Don&rsquo;t you see I
      has?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, are you rich?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but I ben rich wunst, and gwyne to be rich agin. Wunst I
      had foteen dollars, but I tuck to specalat&rsquo;n&rsquo;, en got busted
      out.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you speculate in, Jim?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, fust I tackled stock.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What kind of stock?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, live stock&mdash;cattle, you know. I put ten dollars in
      a cow. But I ain&rsquo; gwyne to resk no mo&rsquo; money in stock.
      De cow up &rsquo;n&rsquo; died on my han&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you lost the ten dollars.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t lose it all. I on&rsquo;y los&rsquo; 
      &rsquo;bout nine of it. I sole de hide en taller for a dollar en ten
      cents.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had five dollars and ten cents left. Did you speculate
      any more?&rdquo;
    </p>

    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. You know that one-laigged nigger dat b&rsquo;longs to
      old Misto Bradish? Well, he sot up a bank, en say anybody dat put in a
      dollar would git fo&rsquo; dollars mo&rsquo; at de en&rsquo; er de year.
      Well, all de niggers went in, but dey didn&rsquo;t have much. I
      wuz de on&rsquo;y one dat had much. So I stuck out for mo&rsquo; dan
      fo&rsquo; dollars, en I said &rsquo;f I didn&rsquo; git it I&rsquo;d start
      a bank mysef. Well, o&rsquo; course dat nigger want&rsquo; to keep me out
      er de business, bekase he says dey warn&rsquo;t business &rsquo;nough for
      two banks, so he say I could put in my five dollars en he pay me
      thirty-five at de en&rsquo; er de year.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I done it. Den I reck&rsquo;n&rsquo;d I&rsquo;d inves&rsquo; 
      de thirty-five dollars right off en keep things a-movin&rsquo;. Dey
      wuz a nigger name&rsquo; Bob, dat had ketched a wood-flat, en his marster
      didn&rsquo; know it; en I bought it off&rsquo;n him en told him to take de
      thirty-five dollars when de en&rsquo; er de year come; but somebody stole
      de wood-flat dat night, en nex day de one-laigged nigger say de bank&rsquo;s
      busted. So dey didn&rsquo; none uv us git no money.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you do with the ten cents, Jim?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I &rsquo;uz gwyne to spen&rsquo; it, but I had a dream, en de
      dream tole me to give it to a nigger name&rsquo; Balum&mdash;Balum&rsquo;s
      Ass dey call him for short; he&rsquo;s one er dem chuckleheads, you know.
      But he&rsquo;s lucky, dey say, en I see I warn&rsquo;t lucky. De
      dream say let Balum inves&rsquo; de ten cents en he&rsquo;d make a raise
      for me. Well, Balum he tuck de money, en when he wuz in church he
      hear de preacher say dat whoever give to de po&rsquo; len&rsquo; to de
      Lord, en boun&rsquo; to git his money back a hund&rsquo;d times. So
      Balum he tuck en give de ten cents to de po&rsquo;, en laid low to see
      what wuz gwyne to come of it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what did come of it, Jim?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>

      &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s all right anyway, Jim, long as you&rsquo;re going

      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> CHAPTER IX.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wanted to go and look at a place right about the middle of the island
      that I&rsquo;d found when I was exploring; so we started and soon got to
      it, because the island was only three miles long and a quarter of a mile
      wide.
    </p>
    <p>
      This place was a tolerable long, steep hill or ridge about forty foot
      high. We had a rough time getting to the top, the sides was so steep and
      the bushes so thick. We tramped and clumb around all over it, and by
      and by found a good big cavern in the rock, most up to the top on the side
      towards Illinois. The cavern was as big as two or three rooms
      bunched together, and Jim could stand up straight in it. It was cool
      in there. Jim was for putting our traps in there right away, but I said we
      didn&rsquo;t want to be climbing up and down there all the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jim said if we had the canoe hid in a good place, and had all the traps in
      the cavern, we could rush there if anybody was to come to the island, and
      they would never find us without dogs. And, besides, he said them
      little birds had said it was going to rain, and did I want the things to
      get wet?
    </p>
    <p>
      So we went back and got the canoe, and paddled up abreast the cavern, and
      lugged all the traps up there. Then we hunted up a place close by to
      hide the canoe in, amongst the thick willows. We took some fish off
      of the lines and set them again, and begun to get ready for dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door of the cavern was big enough to roll a hogshead in, and on one
      side of the door the floor stuck out a little bit, and was flat and a good
      place to build a fire on. So we built it there and cooked dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <a name="c09-75" id="c09-75"></a><br /> <br />
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:60%">
      <img alt="c09-75.jpg (59K)" src="images/c09-75.jpg" style="width:100%;" /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      We spread the blankets inside for a carpet, and eat our dinner in there.
      We put all the other things handy at the back of the cavern. Pretty
      soon it darkened up, and begun to thunder and lighten; so the birds was
      right about it. Directly it begun to rain, and it rained like all
      fury, too, and I never see the wind blow so. It was one of these
      regular summer storms. It would get so dark that it looked all
      blue-black outside, and lovely; and the rain would thrash along by so
      thick that the trees off a little ways looked dim and spider-webby; and
      here would come a blast of wind that would bend the trees down and turn up
      the pale underside of the leaves; and then a perfect ripper of a gust
      would follow along and set the branches to tossing their arms as if they
      was just wild; and next, when it was just about the bluest and blackest&mdash;<i>FST</i>!
      it was as bright as glory, and you&rsquo;d have a little glimpse of
      tree-tops a-plunging about away off yonder in the storm, hundreds of yards
      further than you could see before; dark as sin again in a second, and now
      you&rsquo;d hear the thunder let go with an awful crash, and then go
      rumbling, grumbling, tumbling, down the sky towards the under side of the
      world, like rolling empty barrels down stairs&mdash;where it&rsquo;s long
      stairs and they bounce a good deal, you know.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jim, this is nice,&rdquo; I says. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t want to
      be nowhere else but here. Pass me along another hunk of fish and some hot
      corn-bread.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you wouldn&rsquo;t a ben here &rsquo;f it hadn&rsquo;t a ben
      for Jim. You&rsquo;d a ben down dah in de woods widout any dinner,
      en gittn&rsquo; mos&rsquo; drownded, too; dat you would, honey. Chickens
      knows when it&rsquo;s gwyne to rain, en so do de birds, chile.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The river went on raising and raising for ten or twelve days, till at last
      it was over the banks. The water was three or four foot deep on the
      island in the low places and on the Illinois bottom. On that side it
      was a good many miles wide, but on the Missouri side it was the same old
      distance across&mdash;a half a mile&mdash;because the Missouri shore was
      just a wall of high bluffs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Daytimes we paddled all over the island in the canoe, It was mighty cool
      and shady in the deep woods, even if the sun was blazing outside. We
      went winding in and out amongst the trees, and sometimes the vines hung so
      thick we had to back away and go some other way. Well, on every old
      broken-down tree you could see rabbits and snakes and such things; and
      when the island had been overflowed a day or two they got so tame, on
      account of being hungry, that you could paddle right up and put your hand
      on them if you wanted to; but not the snakes and turtles&mdash;they would
      slide off in the water. The ridge our cavern was in was full of
      them. We could a had pets enough if we&rsquo;d wanted them.
    </p>
    <p>
      One night we catched a little section of a lumber raft&mdash;nice pine
      planks. It was twelve foot wide and about fifteen or sixteen foot long,
      and the top stood above water six or seven inches&mdash;a solid, level
      floor. We could see saw-logs go by in the daylight sometimes, but we
      let them go; we didn&rsquo;t show ourselves in daylight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another night when we was up at the head of the island, just before
      daylight, here comes a frame-house down, on the west side. She was a
      two-story, and tilted over considerable. We paddled out and got
      aboard&mdash;clumb in at an upstairs window. But it was too dark to
      see yet, so we made the canoe fast and set in her to wait for daylight.
    </p>
    <p>
      The light begun to come before we got to the foot of the island. Then
      we looked in at the window. We could make out a bed, and a table,
      and two old chairs, and lots of things around about on the floor, and
      there was clothes hanging against the wall. There was something
      laying on the floor in the far corner that looked like a man. So Jim
      says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, you!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But it didn&rsquo;t budge. So I hollered again, and then Jim says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;De man ain&rsquo;t asleep&mdash;he&rsquo;s dead. You hold
      still&mdash;I&rsquo;ll go en see.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He went, and bent down and looked, and says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a dead man. Yes, indeedy; naked, too. He&rsquo;s
      ben shot in de back. I reck&rsquo;n he&rsquo;s ben dead two er three days.
      Come in, Huck, but doan&rsquo; look at his face&mdash;it&rsquo;s too
      gashly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <a name="c09-77" id="c09-77"></a><br /> <br />
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:60%">

    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      I didn&rsquo;t look at him at all. Jim throwed some old rags over
      him, but he needn&rsquo;t done it; I didn&rsquo;t want to see him. There
      was heaps of old greasy cards scattered around over the floor, and old
      whisky bottles, and a couple of masks made out of black cloth; and all
      over the walls was the ignorantest kind of words and pictures made with
      charcoal. There was two old dirty calico dresses, and a sun-bonnet,
      and some women&rsquo;s underclothes hanging against the wall, and some men&rsquo;s
      clothing, too. We put the lot into the canoe&mdash;it might come
      good. There was a boy&rsquo;s old speckled straw hat on the floor; I
      took that, too. And there was a bottle that had had milk in it, and
      it had a rag stopper for a baby to suck. We would a took the bottle,
      but it was broke. There was a seedy old chest, and an old hair trunk
      with the hinges broke. They stood open, but there warn&rsquo;t
      nothing left in them that was any account. The way things was
      scattered about we reckoned the people left in a hurry, and warn&rsquo;t
      fixed so as to carry off most of their stuff.
    </p>
    <p>
      We got an old tin lantern, and a butcher-knife without any handle, and a
      bran-new Barlow knife worth two bits in any store, and a lot of tallow
      candles, and a tin candlestick, and a gourd, and a tin cup, and a ratty
      old bedquilt off the bed, and a reticule with needles and pins and beeswax
      and buttons and thread and all such truck in it, and a hatchet and some
      nails, and a fishline as thick as my little finger with some monstrous
      hooks on it, and a roll of buckskin, and a leather dog-collar, and a
      horseshoe, and some vials of medicine that didn&rsquo;t have no label on
      them; and just as we was leaving I found a tolerable good curry-comb, and
      Jim he found a ratty old fiddle-bow, and a wooden leg. The straps
      was broke off of it, but, barring that, it was a good enough leg, though
      it was too long for me and not long enough for Jim, and we couldn&rsquo;t
      find the other one, though we hunted all around.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so, take it all around, we made a good haul. When we was ready
      to shove off we was a quarter of a mile below the island, and it was
      pretty broad day; so I made Jim lay down in the canoe and cover up with
      the quilt, because if he set up people could tell he was a nigger a good
      ways off. I paddled over to the Illinois shore, and drifted down
      most a half a mile doing it. I crept up the dead water under the
      bank, and hadn&rsquo;t no accidents and didn&rsquo;t see nobody. We
      got home all safe.

      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> CHAPTER X.
    </p>
    <p>
      After breakfast I wanted to talk about the dead man and guess out how he
      come to be killed, but Jim didn&rsquo;t want to. He said it would
      fetch bad luck; and besides, he said, he might come and ha&rsquo;nt us; he
      said a man that warn&rsquo;t buried was more likely to go a-ha&rsquo;nting
      around than one that was planted and comfortable. That sounded
      pretty reasonable, so I didn&rsquo;t say no more; but I couldn&rsquo;t
      keep from studying over it and wishing I knowed who shot the man, and what
      they done it for.
    </p>
    <p>
      We rummaged the clothes we&rsquo;d got, and found eight dollars in silver
      sewed up in the lining of an old blanket overcoat. Jim said he
      reckoned the people in that house stole the coat, because if they&rsquo;d
      a knowed the money was there they wouldn&rsquo;t a left it. I said I
      reckoned they killed him, too; but Jim didn&rsquo;t want to talk about
      that. I says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now you think it&rsquo;s bad luck; but what did you say when I
      fetched in the snake-skin that I found on the top of the ridge day before
      yesterday? You said it was the worst bad luck in the world to touch a
      snake-skin with my hands. Well, here&rsquo;s your bad luck! We&rsquo;ve
      raked in all this truck and eight dollars besides. I wish we could
      have some bad luck like this every day, Jim.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never you mind, honey, never you mind. Don&rsquo;t you git
      too peart. It&rsquo;s a-comin&rsquo;. Mind I tell you, it&rsquo;s
      a-comin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It did come, too. It was a Tuesday that we had that talk. Well,
      after dinner Friday we was laying around in the grass at the upper end of
      the ridge, and got out of tobacco. I went to the cavern to get some,
      and found a rattlesnake in there. I killed him, and curled him up on
      the foot of Jim&rsquo;s blanket, ever so natural, thinking there&rsquo;d
      be some fun when Jim found him there. Well, by night I forgot all
      about the snake, and when Jim flung himself down on the blanket while I
      struck a light the snake&rsquo;s mate was there, and bit him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He jumped up yelling, and the first thing the light showed was the varmint
      curled up and ready for another spring. I laid him out in a second
      with a stick, and Jim grabbed pap&rsquo;s whisky-jug and begun to pour it
      down.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <a name="c10-80" id="c10-80"></a><br /> <br />
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:60%">
      <img alt="c10-80.jpg (66K)" src="images/c10-80.jpg" style="width:100%;" /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      He was barefooted, and the snake bit him right on the heel. That all
      comes of my being such a fool as to not remember that wherever you leave a
      dead snake its mate always comes there and curls around it. Jim told
      me to chop off the snake&rsquo;s head and throw it away, and then skin the
      body and roast a piece of it. I done it, and he eat it and said it
      would help cure him. He made me take off the rattles and tie them around
      his wrist, too. He said that that would help. Then I slid out
      quiet and throwed the snakes clear away amongst the bushes; for I warn&rsquo;t
      going to let Jim find out it was all my fault, not if I could help it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jim sucked and sucked at the jug, and now and then he got out of his head
      and pitched around and yelled; but every time he come to himself he went
      to sucking at the jug again. His foot swelled up pretty big, and so
      did his leg; but by and by the drunk begun to come, and so I judged he was
      all right; but I&rsquo;d druther been bit with a snake than pap&rsquo;s
      whisky.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jim was laid up for four days and nights. Then the swelling was all
      gone and he was around again. I made up my mind I wouldn&rsquo;t
      ever take a-holt of a snake-skin again with my hands, now that I see what
      had come of it. Jim said he reckoned I would believe him next time. And
      he said that handling a snake-skin was such awful bad luck that maybe we
      hadn&rsquo;t got to the end of it yet. He said he druther see the
      new moon over his left shoulder as much as a thousand times than take up a
      snake-skin in his hand. Well, I was getting to feel that way myself,
      though I&rsquo;ve always reckoned that looking at the new moon over your
      left shoulder is one of the carelessest and foolishest things a body can
      do. Old Hank Bunker done it once, and bragged about it; and in less
      than two years he got drunk and fell off of the shot-tower, and spread
      himself out so that he was just a kind of a layer, as you may say; and
      they slid him edgeways between two barn doors for a coffin, and buried him
      so, so they say, but I didn&rsquo;t see it. Pap told me. But
      anyway it all come of looking at the moon that way, like a fool.

      <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, the days went along, and the river went down between its banks
      again; and about the first thing we done was to bait one of the big hooks
      with a skinned rabbit and set it and catch a catfish that was as big as a
      man, being six foot two inches long, and weighed over two hundred pounds.
      We couldn&rsquo;t handle him, of course; he would a flung us into
      Illinois. We just set there and watched him rip and tear around till
      he drownded. We found a brass button in his stomach and a round
      ball, and lots of rubbage. We split the ball open with the hatchet,
      and there was a spool in it. Jim said he&rsquo;d had it there a long
      time, to coat it over so and make a ball of it. It was as big a fish
      as was ever catched in the Mississippi, I reckon. Jim said he hadn&rsquo;t
      ever seen a bigger one. He would a been worth a good deal over at
      the village. They peddle out such a fish as that by the pound in the
      market-house there; everybody buys some of him; his meat&rsquo;s as white
      as snow and makes a good fry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next morning I said it was getting slow and dull, and I wanted to get a
      stirring up some way. I said I reckoned I would slip over the river
      and find out what was going on. Jim liked that notion; but he said I
      must go in the dark and look sharp. Then he studied it over and
      said, couldn&rsquo;t I put on some of them old things and dress up like a
      girl? That was a good notion, too. So we shortened up one of
      the calico gowns, and I turned up my trouser-legs to my knees and got into
      it. Jim hitched it behind with the hooks, and it was a fair fit.
      I put on the sun-bonnet and tied it under my chin, and then for a
      body to look in and see my face was like looking down a joint of
      stove-pipe. Jim said nobody would know me, even in the daytime,
      hardly. I practiced around all day to get the hang of the things,
      and by and by I could do pretty well in them, only Jim said I didn&rsquo;t
      walk like a girl; and he said I must quit pulling up my gown to get at my
      britches-pocket. I took notice, and done better.

    </p>
    <p>
      I started up the Illinois shore in the canoe just after dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      I started across to the town from a little below the ferry-landing, and
      the drift of the current fetched me in at the bottom of the town. I
      tied up and started along the bank. There was a light burning in a
      little shanty that hadn&rsquo;t been lived in for a long time, and I
      wondered who had took up quarters there. I slipped up and peeped in
      at the window. There was a woman about forty year old in there
      knitting by a candle that was on a pine table. I didn&rsquo;t know
      her face; she was a stranger, for you couldn&rsquo;t start a face in that
      town that I didn&rsquo;t know. Now this was lucky, because I was
      weakening; I was getting afraid I had come; people might know my voice and
      find me out. But if this woman had been in such a little town two
      days she could tell me all I wanted to know; so I knocked at the door, and
      made up my mind I wouldn&rsquo;t forget I was a girl.

      &ldquo;Where &rsquo;bouts do you live? In this neighborhood?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&rsquo;m. In Hookerville, seven mile below. I&rsquo;ve
      walked all the way and I&rsquo;m all tired out.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hungry, too, I reckon. I&rsquo;ll find you something.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&rsquo;m, I ain&rsquo;t hungry. I was so hungry I had to
      stop two miles below here at a farm; so I ain&rsquo;t hungry no more.
      It&rsquo;s what makes me so late. My mother&rsquo;s down sick, and
      out of money and everything, and I come to tell my uncle Abner Moore.
      He lives at the upper end of the town, she says. I hain&rsquo;t
      ever been here before. Do you know him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; but I don&rsquo;t know everybody yet. I haven&rsquo;t
      lived here quite two weeks. It&rsquo;s a considerable ways to the upper
      end of the town. You better stay here all night. Take off your
      bonnet.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; I says; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll rest a while, I reckon, and go
      on. I ain&rsquo;t afeared of the dark.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She said she wouldn&rsquo;t let me go by myself, but her husband would be
      in by and by, maybe in a hour and a half, and she&rsquo;d send him along
      with me. Then she got to talking about her husband, and about her
      relations up the river, and her relations down the river, and about how
      much better off they used to was, and how they didn&rsquo;t know but they&rsquo;d
      made a mistake coming to our town, instead of letting well alone&mdash;and
      so on and so on, till I was afeard I had made a mistake coming to her to
      find out what was going on in the town; but by and by she dropped on to
      pap and the murder, and then I was pretty willing to let her clatter right
      along. She told about me and Tom Sawyer finding the six thousand
      dollars (only she got it ten) and all about pap and what a hard lot he
      was, and what a hard lot I was, and at last she got down to where I was
      murdered. I says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who done it? We&rsquo;ve heard considerable about these
      goings on down in Hookerville, but we don&rsquo;t know who &rsquo;twas
      that killed Huck Finn.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I reckon there&rsquo;s a right smart chance of people <i>here</i>
      that&rsquo;d like to know who killed him. Some think old Finn done
      it himself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;is that so?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most everybody thought it at first. He&rsquo;ll never know
      how nigh he come to getting lynched. But before night they changed
      around and judged it was done by a runaway nigger named Jim.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why <i>he</i>&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I stopped. I reckoned I better keep still. She run on, and
      never noticed I had put in at all:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The nigger run off the very night Huck Finn was killed. So
      there&rsquo;s a reward out for him&mdash;three hundred dollars. And
      there&rsquo;s a reward out for old Finn, too&mdash;two hundred dollars.
      You see, he come to town the morning after the murder, and told
      about it, and was out with &rsquo;em on the ferryboat hunt, and right away
      after he up and left. Before night they wanted to lynch him, but he
      was gone, you see. Well, next day they found out the nigger was
      gone; they found out he hadn&rsquo;t ben seen sence ten o&rsquo;clock the
      night the murder was done. So then they put it on him, you see; and
      while they was full of it, next day, back comes old Finn, and went
      boo-hooing to Judge Thatcher to get money to hunt for the nigger all over
      Illinois with. The judge gave him some, and that evening he got drunk, and
      was around till after midnight with a couple of mighty hard-looking
      strangers, and then went off with them. Well, he hain&rsquo;t come
      back sence, and they ain&rsquo;t looking for him back till this thing
      blows over a little, for people thinks now that he killed his boy and
      fixed things so folks would think robbers done it, and then he&rsquo;d get
      Huck&rsquo;s money without having to bother a long time with a lawsuit.
      People do say he warn&rsquo;t any too good to do it. Oh, he&rsquo;s
      sly, I reckon. If he don&rsquo;t come back for a year he&rsquo;ll be
      all right. You can&rsquo;t prove anything on him, you know;
      everything will be quieted down then, and he&rsquo;ll walk in Huck&rsquo;s
      money as easy as nothing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I reckon so, &rsquo;m. I don&rsquo;t see nothing in the
      way of it. Has everybody quit thinking the nigger done it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, not everybody. A good many thinks he done it. But
      they&rsquo;ll get the nigger pretty soon now, and maybe they can scare it
      out of him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, are they after him yet?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;re innocent, ain&rsquo;t you! Does three
      hundred dollars lay around every day for people to pick up? Some
      folks think the nigger ain&rsquo;t far from here. I&rsquo;m one of
      them&mdash;but I hain&rsquo;t talked it around. A few days ago I was
      talking with an old couple that lives next door in the log shanty, and
      they happened to say hardly anybody ever goes to that island over yonder
      that they call Jackson&rsquo;s Island. Don&rsquo;t anybody live
      there? says I. No, nobody, says they. I didn&rsquo;t say any more,
      but I done some thinking. I was pretty near certain I&rsquo;d seen
      smoke over there, about the head of the island, a day or two before that,
      so I says to myself, like as not that nigger&rsquo;s hiding over there;
      anyway, says I, it&rsquo;s worth the trouble to give the place a hunt.
      I hain&rsquo;t seen any smoke sence, so I reckon maybe he&rsquo;s
      gone, if it was him; but husband&rsquo;s going over to see&mdash;him and
      another man. He was gone up the river; but he got back to-day, and I
      told him as soon as he got here two hours ago.&rdquo;

    <p>
      I had got so uneasy I couldn&rsquo;t set still. I had to do
      something with my hands; so I took up a needle off of the table and went
      to threading it. My hands shook, and I was making a bad job of it. When
      the woman stopped talking I looked up, and she was looking at me pretty
      curious and smiling a little. I put down the needle and thread, and
      let on to be interested&mdash;and I was, too&mdash;and says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three hundred dollars is a power of money. I wish my mother
      could get it. Is your husband going over there to-night?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes. He went up-town with the man I was telling you of,
      to get a boat and see if they could borrow another gun. They&rsquo;ll
      go over after midnight.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t they see better if they was to wait till daytime?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. And couldn&rsquo;t the nigger see better, too? After
      midnight he&rsquo;ll likely be asleep, and they can slip around through
      the woods and hunt up his camp fire all the better for the dark, if he&rsquo;s
      got one.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think of that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman kept looking at me pretty curious, and I didn&rsquo;t feel a bit
      comfortable. Pretty soon she says,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you say your name was, honey?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M&mdash;Mary Williams.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Somehow it didn&rsquo;t seem to me that I said it was Mary before, so I
      didn&rsquo;t look up&mdash;seemed to me I said it was Sarah; so I felt
      sort of cornered, and was afeared maybe I was looking it, too. I
      wished the woman would say something more; the longer she set still the
      uneasier I was. But now she says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Honey, I thought you said it was Sarah when you first come in?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes&rsquo;m, I did. Sarah Mary Williams. Sarah&rsquo;s
      my first name. Some calls me Sarah, some calls me Mary.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s the way of it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&rsquo;m.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I was feeling better then, but I wished I was out of there, anyway. I
      couldn&rsquo;t look up yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, the woman fell to talking about how hard times was, and how poor
      they had to live, and how the rats was as free as if they owned the place,
      and so forth and so on, and then I got easy again. She was right
      about the rats. You&rsquo;d see one stick his nose out of a hole in the
      corner every little while. She said she had to have things handy to
      throw at them when she was alone, or they wouldn&rsquo;t give her no
      peace. She showed me a bar of lead twisted up into a knot, and said
      she was a good shot with it generly, but she&rsquo;d wrenched her arm a
      day or two ago, and didn&rsquo;t know whether she could throw true now.
      But she watched for a chance, and directly banged away at a rat; but
      she missed him wide, and said &ldquo;Ouch!&rdquo; it hurt her arm so.
      Then she told me to try for the next one. I wanted to be
      getting away before the old man got back, but of course I didn&rsquo;t let
      on. I got the thing, and the first rat that showed his nose I let
      drive, and if he&rsquo;d a stayed where he was he&rsquo;d a been a
      tolerable sick rat. She said that was first-rate, and she reckoned I
      would hive the next one. She went and got the lump of lead and
      fetched it back, and brought along a hank of yarn which she wanted me to
      help her with. I held up my two hands and she put the hank over
      them, and went on talking about her and her husband&rsquo;s matters.
      But she broke off to say:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep your eye on the rats. You better have the lead in your
      lap, handy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So she dropped the lump into my lap just at that moment, and I clapped my
      legs together on it and she went on talking. But only about a
      minute. Then she took off the hank and looked me straight in the face, and
      very pleasant, and says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, now, what&rsquo;s your real name?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wh&mdash;what, mum?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your real name? Is it Bill, or Tom, or Bob?&mdash;or
      what is it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I reckon I shook like a leaf, and I didn&rsquo;t know hardly what to do.
      But I says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please to don&rsquo;t poke fun at a poor girl like me, mum. If
      I&rsquo;m in the way here, I&rsquo;ll&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you won&rsquo;t. Set down and stay where you are. I
      ain&rsquo;t going to hurt you, and I ain&rsquo;t going to tell on you,
      nuther. You just tell me your secret, and trust me. I&rsquo;ll
      keep it; and, what&rsquo;s more, I&rsquo;ll help you. So&rsquo;ll my old
      man if you want him to. You see, you&rsquo;re a runaway &rsquo;prentice,
      that&rsquo;s all. It ain&rsquo;t anything. There ain&rsquo;t
      no harm in it. You&rsquo;ve been treated bad, and you made up your mind to
      cut. Bless you, child, I wouldn&rsquo;t tell on you. Tell me
      all about it now, that&rsquo;s a good boy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So I said it wouldn&rsquo;t be no use to try to play it any longer, and I
      would just make a clean breast and tell her everything, but she musn&rsquo;t
      go back on her promise. Then I told her my father and mother was
      dead, and the law had bound me out to a mean old farmer in the country
      thirty mile back from the river, and he treated me so bad I couldn&rsquo;t
      stand it no longer; he went away to be gone a couple of days, and so I
      took my chance and stole some of his daughter&rsquo;s old clothes and
      cleared out, and I had been three nights coming the thirty miles. I
      traveled nights, and hid daytimes and slept, and the bag of bread and meat
      I carried from home lasted me all the way, and I had a-plenty. I
      said I believed my uncle Abner Moore would take care of me, and so that
      was why I struck out for this town of Goshen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Goshen, child? This ain&rsquo;t Goshen. This is St.
      Petersburg. Goshen&rsquo;s ten mile further up the river. Who
      told you this was Goshen?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, a man I met at daybreak this morning, just as I was going to
      turn into the woods for my regular sleep. He told me when the roads
      forked I must take the right hand, and five mile would fetch me to Goshen.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was drunk, I reckon. He told you just exactly wrong.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he did act like he was drunk, but it ain&rsquo;t no matter
      now. I got to be moving along. I&rsquo;ll fetch Goshen before
      daylight.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold on a minute. I&rsquo;ll put you up a snack to eat.
      You might want it.&rdquo;
    </p>

    </div>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      So she put me up a snack, and says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, when a cow&rsquo;s laying down, which end of her gets up
      first? Answer up prompt now&mdash;don&rsquo;t stop to study over it.
      Which end gets up first?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The hind end, mum.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, a horse?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The for&rsquo;rard end, mum.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which side of a tree does the moss grow on?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;North side.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If fifteen cows is browsing on a hillside, how many of them eats
      with their heads pointed the same direction?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The whole fifteen, mum.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I reckon you <i>have</i> lived in the country. I
      thought maybe you was trying to hocus me again. What&rsquo;s your
      real name, now?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;George Peters, mum.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, try to remember it, George. Don&rsquo;t forget and tell
      me it&rsquo;s Elexander before you go, and then get out by saying it&rsquo;s
      George Elexander when I catch you. And don&rsquo;t go about women in
      that old calico. You do a girl tolerable poor, but you might fool
      men, maybe. Bless you, child, when you set out to thread a needle
      don&rsquo;t hold the thread still and fetch the needle up to it; hold the
      needle still and poke the thread at it; that&rsquo;s the way a woman most
      always does, but a man always does t&rsquo;other way. And when you
      throw at a rat or anything, hitch yourself up a tiptoe and fetch your hand
      up over your head as awkward as you can, and miss your rat about six or
      seven foot. Throw stiff-armed from the shoulder, like there was a pivot
      there for it to turn on, like a girl; not from the wrist and elbow, with
      your arm out to one side, like a boy. And, mind you, when a girl
      tries to catch anything in her lap she throws her knees apart; she don&rsquo;t
      clap them together, the way you did when you catched the lump of lead.
      Why, I spotted you for a boy when you was threading the needle; and
      I contrived the other things just to make certain. Now trot along to
      your uncle, Sarah Mary Williams George Elexander Peters, and if you get
      into trouble you send word to Mrs. Judith Loftus, which is me, and I&rsquo;ll
      do what I can to get you out of it. Keep the river road all the way,
      and next time you tramp take shoes and socks with you. The river road&rsquo;s
      a rocky one, and your feet&rsquo;ll be in a condition when you get to
      Goshen, I reckon.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I went up the bank about fifty yards, and then I doubled on my tracks and
      slipped back to where my canoe was, a good piece below the house. I
      jumped in, and was off in a hurry. I went up-stream far enough to
      make the head of the island, and then started across. I took off the
      sun-bonnet, for I didn&rsquo;t want no blinders on then. When I was
      about the middle I heard the clock begin to strike, so I stops and
      listens; the sound come faint over the water but clear&mdash;eleven.
      When I struck the head of the island I never waited to blow, though
      I was most winded, but I shoved right into the timber where my old camp
      used to be, and started a good fire there on a high and dry spot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I jumped in the canoe and dug out for our place, a mile and a half
      below, as hard as I could go. I landed, and slopped through the
      timber and up the ridge and into the cavern. There Jim laid, sound
      asleep on the ground. I roused him out and says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Git up and hump yourself, Jim! There ain&rsquo;t a minute to
      lose. They&rsquo;re after us!&rdquo;
    </p>

    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Jim never asked no questions, he never said a word; but the way he worked
      for the next half an hour showed about how he was scared. By that
      time everything we had in the world was on our raft, and she was ready to
      be shoved out from the willow cove where she was hid. We put out the
      camp fire at the cavern the first thing, and didn&rsquo;t show a candle
      outside after that.
    </p>
    <p>
      I took the canoe out from the shore a little piece, and took a look; but
      if there was a boat around I couldn&rsquo;t see it, for stars and shadows
      ain&rsquo;t good to see by. Then we got out the raft and slipped
      along down in the shade, past the foot of the island dead still&mdash;never
      saying a word.

      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> CHAPTER XII.
    </p>
    <p>
      It must a been close on to one o&rsquo;clock when we got below the island
      at last, and the raft did seem to go mighty slow. If a boat was to
      come along we was going to take to the canoe and break for the Illinois
      shore; and it was well a boat didn&rsquo;t come, for we hadn&rsquo;t ever
      thought to put the gun in the canoe, or a fishing-line, or anything to
      eat. We was in ruther too much of a sweat to think of so many
      things. It warn&rsquo;t good judgment to put <i>everything</i> on
      the raft.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the men went to the island I just expect they found the camp fire I
      built, and watched it all night for Jim to come. Anyways, they
      stayed away from us, and if my building the fire never fooled them it warn&rsquo;t
      no fault of mine. I played it as low down on them as I could.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the first streak of day began to show we tied up to a towhead in a
      big bend on the Illinois side, and hacked off cottonwood branches with the
      hatchet, and covered up the raft with them so she looked like there had
      been a cave-in in the bank there. A tow-head is a sandbar that has
      cottonwoods on it as thick as harrow-teeth.

      We had mountains on the Missouri shore and heavy timber on the Illinois
      side, and the channel was down the Missouri shore at that place, so we
      warn&rsquo;t afraid of anybody running across us. We laid there all
      day, and watched the rafts and steamboats spin down the Missouri shore,
      and up-bound steamboats fight the big river in the middle. I told
      Jim all about the time I had jabbering with that woman; and Jim said she
      was a smart one, and if she was to start after us herself she wouldn&rsquo;t
      set down and watch a camp fire&mdash;no, sir, she&rsquo;d fetch a dog.
      Well, then, I said, why couldn&rsquo;t she tell her husband to fetch
      a dog? Jim said he bet she did think of it by the time the men was
      ready to start, and he believed they must a gone up-town to get a dog and
      so they lost all that time, or else we wouldn&rsquo;t be here on a towhead
      sixteen or seventeen mile below the village&mdash;no, indeedy, we would be
      in that same old town again. So I said I didn&rsquo;t care what was
      the reason they didn&rsquo;t get us as long as they didn&rsquo;t.
    </p>
    <p>
      When it was beginning to come on dark we poked our heads out of the
      cottonwood thicket, and looked up and down and across; nothing in sight;
      so Jim took up some of the top planks of the raft and built a snug wigwam
      to get under in blazing weather and rainy, and to keep the things dry. Jim
      made a floor for the wigwam, and raised it a foot or more above the level
      of the raft, so now the blankets and all the traps was out of reach of
      steamboat waves. Right in the middle of the wigwam we made a layer
      of dirt about five or six inches deep with a frame around it for to hold
      it to its place; this was to build a fire on in sloppy weather or chilly;
      the wigwam would keep it from being seen. We made an extra
      steering-oar, too, because one of the others might get broke on a snag or
      something. We fixed up a short forked stick to hang the old lantern on,
      because we must always light the lantern whenever we see a steamboat
      coming down-stream, to keep from getting run over; but we wouldn&rsquo;t
      have to light it for up-stream boats unless we see we was in what they
      call a &ldquo;crossing&rdquo;; for the river was pretty high yet, very low
      banks being still a little under water; so up-bound boats didn&rsquo;t
      always run the channel, but hunted easy water.
    </p>
    <p>
      This second night we run between seven and eight hours, with a current
      that was making over four mile an hour. We catched fish and talked,
      and we took a swim now and then to keep off sleepiness. It was kind
      of solemn, drifting down the big, still river, laying on our backs looking
      up at the stars, and we didn&rsquo;t ever feel like talking loud, and it
      warn&rsquo;t often that we laughed&mdash;only a little kind of a low
      chuckle. We had mighty good weather as a general thing, and nothing
      ever happened to us at all&mdash;that night, nor the next, nor the next.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every night we passed towns, some of them away up on black hillsides,
      nothing but just a shiny bed of lights; not a house could you see. The
      fifth night we passed St. Louis, and it was like the whole world lit up.
      In St. Petersburg they used to say there was twenty or thirty thousand
      people in St. Louis, but I never believed it till I see that wonderful
      spread of lights at two o&rsquo;clock that still night. There warn&rsquo;t
      a sound there; everybody was asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every night now I used to slip ashore towards ten o&rsquo;clock at some
      little village, and buy ten or fifteen cents&rsquo; worth of meal or bacon
      or other stuff to eat; and sometimes I lifted a chicken that warn&rsquo;t
      roosting comfortable, and took him along. Pap always said, take a
      chicken when you get a chance, because if you don&rsquo;t want him
      yourself you can easy find somebody that does, and a good deed ain&rsquo;t
      ever forgot. I never see pap when he didn&rsquo;t want the chicken
      himself, but that is what he used to say, anyway.

      Mornings before daylight I slipped into cornfields and borrowed a
      watermelon, or a mushmelon, or a punkin, or some new corn, or things of
      that kind. Pap always said it warn&rsquo;t no harm to borrow things
      if you was meaning to pay them back some time; but the widow said it warn&rsquo;t
      anything but a soft name for stealing, and no decent body would do it.
      Jim said he reckoned the widow was partly right and pap was partly
      right; so the best way would be for us to pick out two or three things
      from the list and say we wouldn&rsquo;t borrow them any more&mdash;then he
      reckoned it wouldn&rsquo;t be no harm to borrow the others. So we
      talked it over all one night, drifting along down the river, trying to
      make up our minds whether to drop the watermelons, or the cantelopes, or
      the mushmelons, or what. But towards daylight we got it all settled
      satisfactory, and concluded to drop crabapples and p&rsquo;simmons. We
      warn&rsquo;t feeling just right before that, but it was all comfortable
      now. I was glad the way it come out, too, because crabapples ain&rsquo;t
      ever good, and the p&rsquo;simmons wouldn&rsquo;t be ripe for two or three
      months yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      We shot a water-fowl now and then that got up too early in the morning or
      didn&rsquo;t go to bed early enough in the evening. Take it all
      round, we lived pretty high.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fifth night below St. Louis we had a big storm after midnight, with a
      power of thunder and lightning, and the rain poured down in a solid sheet.
      We stayed in the wigwam and let the raft take care of itself. When the
      lightning glared out we could see a big straight river ahead, and high,
      rocky bluffs on both sides. By and by says I, &ldquo;Hel-<i>lo</i>,
      Jim, looky yonder!&rdquo; It was a steamboat that had killed herself on a
      rock. We was drifting straight down for her. The lightning
      showed her very distinct. She was leaning over, with part of her
      upper deck above water, and you could see every little chimbly-guy clean
      and clear, and a chair by the big bell, with an old slouch hat hanging on
      the back of it, when the flashes come.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, it being away in the night and stormy, and all so mysterious-like, I
      felt just the way any other boy would a felt when I see that wreck laying
      there so mournful and lonesome in the middle of the river. I wanted
      to get aboard of her and slink around a little, and see what there was
      there. So I says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Le&rsquo;s land on her, Jim.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But Jim was dead against it at first. He says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I doan&rsquo; want to go fool&rsquo;n &rsquo;long er no wrack.
      We&rsquo;s doin&rsquo; blame&rsquo; well, en we better let blame&rsquo; 
      well alone, as de good book says. Like as not dey&rsquo;s a watchman
      on dat wrack.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Watchman your grandmother,&rdquo; I says; &ldquo;there ain&rsquo;t
      nothing to watch but the texas and the pilot-house; and do you reckon
      anybody&rsquo;s going to resk his life for a texas and a pilot-house such
      a night as this, when it&rsquo;s likely to break up and wash off down the
      river any minute?&rdquo; Jim couldn&rsquo;t say nothing to that, so
      he didn&rsquo;t try. &ldquo;And besides,&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;we might
      borrow something worth having out of the captain&rsquo;s stateroom. Seegars,
      I bet you&mdash;and cost five cents apiece, solid cash. Steamboat
      captains is always rich, and get sixty dollars a month, and <i>they</i>
      don&rsquo;t care a cent what a thing costs, you know, long as they want
      it. Stick a candle in your pocket; I can&rsquo;t rest, Jim, till we
      give her a rummaging. Do you reckon Tom Sawyer would ever go by this
      thing? Not for pie, he wouldn&rsquo;t. He&rsquo;d call it an
      adventure&mdash;that&rsquo;s what he&rsquo;d call it; and he&rsquo;d land
      on that wreck if it was his last act. And wouldn&rsquo;t he throw
      style into it?&mdash;wouldn&rsquo;t he spread himself, nor nothing? Why,
      you&rsquo;d think it was Christopher C&rsquo;lumbus discovering
      Kingdom-Come. I wish Tom Sawyer <i>was</i> here.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jim he grumbled a little, but give in. He said we mustn&rsquo;t talk
      any more than we could help, and then talk mighty low. The lightning
      showed us the wreck again just in time, and we fetched the stabboard
      derrick, and made fast there.
    </p>
    <p>
      The deck was high out here. We went sneaking down the slope of it to
      labboard, in the dark, towards the texas, feeling our way slow with our
      feet, and spreading our hands out to fend off the guys, for it was so dark
      we couldn&rsquo;t see no sign of them. Pretty soon we struck the
      forward end of the skylight, and clumb on to it; and the next step fetched
      us in front of the captain&rsquo;s door, which was open, and by Jimminy,
      away down through the texas-hall we see a light! and all in the same
      second we seem to hear low voices in yonder!
    </p>
    <p>
      Jim whispered and said he was feeling powerful sick, and told me to come
      along. I says, all right, and was going to start for the raft; but
      just then I heard a voice wail out and say:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, please don&rsquo;t, boys; I swear I won&rsquo;t ever tell!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Another voice said, pretty loud:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a lie, Jim Turner. You&rsquo;ve acted this way
      before. You always want more&rsquo;n your share of the truck, and
      you&rsquo;ve always got it, too, because you&rsquo;ve swore &rsquo;t if
      you didn&rsquo;t you&rsquo;d tell. But this time you&rsquo;ve said
